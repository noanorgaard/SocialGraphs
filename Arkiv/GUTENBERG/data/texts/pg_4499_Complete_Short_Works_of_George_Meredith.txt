<h2>
      THE WHITE ROSE CLUB
    </h2>
<p>
      In those lusty ages when the Kaisers lifted high the golden goblet of
      Aachen, and drank, elbow upward, the green-eyed wine of old romance, there
      lived, a bow-shot from the bones of the Eleven Thousand Virgins and the
      Three Holy Kings, a prosperous Rhinelander, by name Gottlieb Groschen, or,
      as it was sometimes ennobled, Gottlieb von Groschen; than whom no
      wealthier merchant bartered for the glory of his ancient mother-city, nor
      more honoured burgess swallowed impartially red juice and white under the
      shadow of his own fig-tree.
    </p>
<p>
      Vine-hills, among the hottest sun-bibbers of the Rheingau, glistened in
      the roll of Gottlieb’s possessions; corn-acres below Cologne;
      basalt-quarries about Linz; mineral-springs in Nassau, a legacy of the
      Romans to the genius and enterprise of the first of German traders. He
      could have bought up every hawking crag, owner and all, from Hatto’s Tower
      to Rheineck. Lore-ley, combing her yellow locks against the night-cloud,
      beheld old Gottlieb’s rafts endlessly stealing on the moonlight through
      the iron pass she peoples above St. Goar. A wailful host were the wives of
      his raftsmen widowed there by her watery music!
    </p>
<p>
      This worthy citizen of Cologne held vasty manuscript letters of the Kaiser
      addressed to him:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dear Well-born son and Subject of mine, Gottlieb!’ and he was easy with
      the proudest princes of the Holy German Realm. For Gottlieb was a
      money-lender and an honest man in one body. He laid out for the plenteous
      harvests of usury, not pressing the seasons with too much rigour. ‘I sow
      my seed in winter,’ said he, ‘and hope to reap good profit in autumn; but
      if the crop be scanty, better let it lie and fatten the soil.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Old earth’s the wisest creditor,’ he would add; ‘she never squeezes the
      sun, but just takes what he can give her year by year, and so makes sure
      of good annual interest.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Therefore when people asked Gottlieb how he had risen to such a pinnacle
      of fortune, the old merchant screwed his eye into its wisest corner, and
      answered slyly, ‘Because I ‘ve always been a student of the heavenly
      bodies’; a communication which failed not to make the orbs and systems
      objects of ardent popular worship in Cologne, where the science was long
      since considered alchymic, and still may be.
    </p>
<p>
      Seldom could the Kaiser go to war on Welschland without first taking
      earnest counsel of his Well-born son and Subject Gottlieb, and lightening
      his chests. Indeed the imperial pastime must have ceased, and the Kaiser
      had languished but for him. Cologne counted its illustrious citizen
      something more than man. The burghers doffed when he passed; and scampish
      leather-draggled urchins gazed after him with praeternatural respect on
      their hanging chins, as if a gold-mine of great girth had walked through
      the awe-struck game.
    </p>
<p>
      But, for the young men of Cologne he had a higher claim to reverence as
      father of the fair Margarita, the White Rose of Germany; a noble maiden,
      peerless, and a jewel for princes.
    </p>
<p>
      The devotion of these youths should give them a name in chivalry. In her
      honour, daily and nightly, they earned among themselves black bruises and
      paraded discoloured countenances, with the humble hope to find it pleasing
      in her sight. The tender fanatics went in bands up and down Rhineland,
      challenging wayfarers and the peasantry with staff and beaker to
      acknowledge the supremacy of their mistress. Whoso of them journeyed into
      foreign parts, wrote home boasting how many times his head had been broken
      on behalf of the fair Margarita; and if this happened very often, a spirit
      of envy was created, which compelled him, when he returned, to verify his
      prowess on no less than a score of his rivals. Not to possess a
      beauty-scar, as the wounds received in these endless combats were called,
      became the sign of inferiority, so that much voluntary maiming was
      conjectured to be going on; and to obviate this piece of treachery,
      minutes of fights were taken and attested, setting forth that a certain
      glorious cut or crack was honourably won in fair field; on what occasion;
      and from whom; every member of the White Rose Club keeping his particular
      scroll, and, on days of festival and holiday, wearing it haughtily in his
      helm. Strangers entering Cologne were astonished at the hideous appearance
      of the striplings, and thought they never had observed so ugly a race; but
      they were forced to admit the fine influence of beauty on commerce, seeing
      that the consumption of beer increased almost hourly. All Bavaria could
      not equal Cologne for quantity made away with.
    </p>
<p>
      The chief members of the White Rose Club were Berthold Schmidt, the rich
      goldsmith’s son; Dietrich Schill, son of the imperial saddler; Heinrich
      Abt, Franz Endermann, and Ernst Geller, sons of chief burghers, each of
      whom carried a yard-long scroll in his cap, and was too disfigured in
      person for men to require an inspection of the document. They were
      dangerous youths to meet, for the oaths, ceremonies, and recantations they
      demanded from every wayfarer, under the rank of baron, were what few might
      satisfactorily perform, if lovers of woman other than the fair Margarita,
      or loyal husbands; and what none save trained heads and stomachs could
      withstand, however naturally manful. The captain of the Club was he who
      could drink most beer without intermediate sighing, and whose face
      reckoned the proudest number of slices and mixture of colours. The
      captaincy was most in dispute between Dietrich Schill and Berthold
      Schmidt, who, in the heat and constancy of contention, were gradually
      losing likeness to man. ‘Good coin,’ they gloried to reflect, ‘needs no
      stamp.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      One youth in Cologne held out against the standing tyranny, and chose to
      do beauty homage in his own fashion, and at his leisure. It was Farina,
      and oaths were registered against him over empty beer-barrels. An axiom of
      the White Rose Club laid it down that everybody must be enamoured of
      Margarita, and the conscience of the Club made them trebly suspicious of
      those who were not members. They had the consolation of knowing that
      Farina was poor, but then he was affirmed a student of Black Arts, and
      from such a one the worst might reasonably be feared. He might bewitch
      Margarita!
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich Schill was deputed by the Club to sound the White Rose herself on
      the subject of Farina, and one afternoon in the vintage season, when she
      sat under the hot vine-poles among maiden friends, eating ripe grapes, up
      sauntered Dietrich, smirking, cap in hand, with his scroll trailed behind
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Wilt thou?’ said Margarita, offering him a bunch.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Unhappy villain that I am!’ replied Dietrich, gesticulating fox-like
      refusal; ‘if I but accept a favour, I break faith with the Club.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Break it to pleasure me,’ said Margarita, smiling wickedly.
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich gasped. He stood on tiptoe to see if any of the Club were by, and
      half-stretched out his hand. A mocking laugh caused him to draw it back as
      if stung. The grapes fell. Farina was at Margarita’s feet offering them in
      return.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Wilt thou?’ said Margarita, with softer stress, and slight excess of
      bloom in her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina put the purple cluster to his breast, and clutched them hard on his
      heart, still kneeling.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita’s brow and bosom seemed to be reflections of the streaming
      crimson there. She shook her face to the sky, and affected laughter at the
      symbol. Her companions clapped hands. Farina’s eyes yearned to her once,
      and then he rose and joined in the pleasantry.
    </p>
<p>
      Fury helped Dietrich to forget his awkwardness. He touched Farina on the
      shoulder with two fingers, and muttered huskily: ‘The Club never allow
      that.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina bowed, as to thank him deeply for the rules of the Club. ‘I am not
      a member, you know,’ said he, and strolled to a seat close by Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich glared after him. As head of a Club he understood the use of
      symbols. He had lost a splendid opportunity, and Farina had seized it.
      Farina had robbed him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May I speak with Mistress Margarita?’ inquired the White Rose chief, in a
      ragged voice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Surely, Dietrich! do speak,’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Alone?’ he continued.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is that allowed by the Club?’ said one of the young girls, with a saucy
      glance.
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich deigned no reply, but awaited Margarita’s decision. She hesitated
      a second; then stood up her full height before him; faced him steadily,
      and beckoned him some steps up the vine-path. Dietrich bowed, and passing
      Farina, informed him that the Club would wring satisfaction out of him for
      the insult.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina laughed, but answered, ‘Look, you of the Club! beer-swilling has
      improved your manners as much as fighting has beautified your faces. Go
      on; drink and fight! but remember that the Kaiser’s coming, and fellows
      with him who will not be bullied.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What mean you?’ cried Dietrich, lurching round on his enemy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not so loud, friend,’ returned Farina. ‘Or do you wish to frighten the
      maidens? I mean this, that the Club had better give as little offence as
      possible, and keep their eyes as wide as they can, if they want to be of
      service to Mistress Margarita.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich turned off with a grunt.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now!’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      She was tapping her foot. Dietrich grew unfaithful to the Club, and looked
      at her longer than his mission warranted. She was bright as the sunset
      gardens of the Golden Apples. The braids of her yellow hair were bound in
      wreaths, and on one side of her head a saffron crocus was stuck with the
      bell downward. Sweetness, song, and wit hung like dews of morning on her
      grape-stained lips. She wore a scarlet corset with bands of black velvet
      across her shoulders. The girlish gown was thin blue stuff, and fell short
      over her firm-set feet, neatly cased in white leather with buckles. There
      was witness in her limbs and the way she carried her neck of an amiable,
      but capable, dragon, ready, when aroused, to bristle up and guard the
      Golden Apples against all save the rightful claimant. Yet her nether lip
      and little white chin-ball had a dreamy droop; her frank blue eyes went
      straight into the speaker: the dragon slept. It was a dangerous charm.
      ‘For,’ says the minnesinger, ‘what ornament more enchants us on a young
      beauty than the soft slumber of a strength never yet called forth, and
      that herself knows not of! It sings double things to the heart of
      knighthood; lures, and warns us; woos, and threatens. ‘Tis as nature,
      shining peace, yet the mother of storm.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is no man,’ rapturously exclaims Heinrich von der Jungferweide,
      ‘can resist the desire to win a sweet treasure before which lies a dragon
      sleeping. The very danger prattles promise.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      But the dragon must really sleep, as with Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A sham dragon, shamming sleep, has destroyed more virgins than all the
      heathen emperors,’ says old Hans Aepfelmann of Duesseldorf.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita’s foot was tapping quicker.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Speak, Dietrich!’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich declared to the Club that at this point he muttered, ‘We love
      you.’ Margarita was glad to believe he had not spoken of himself. He then
      informed her of the fears entertained by the Club, sworn to watch over and
      protect her, regarding Farina’s arts.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And what fear you?’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We fear, sweet mistress, he may be in league with Sathanas,’ replied
      Dietrich.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Truly, then,’ said Margarita, ‘of all the youths in Cologne he is the
      least like his confederate.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich gulped and winked, like a patient recovering wry-faced from an
      abhorred potion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We have warned you, Fraulein Groschen!’ he exclaimed. ‘It now becomes our
      duty to see that you are not snared.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita reddened, and returned: ‘You are kind. But I am a Christian
      maiden and not a Pagan soldan, and I do not require a body of tawny guards
      at my heels.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Thereat she flung back to her companions, and began staining her pretty
      mouth with grapes anew.

<h2>
      THE TAPESTRY WORD
    </h2>
<p>
      Fair maids will have their hero in history. Siegfried was Margarita’s
      chosen. She sang of Siegfried all over the house. ‘O the old days of
      Germany, when such a hero walked!’ she sang.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And who wins Margarita,’ mused Farina, ‘happier than Siegfried, has in
      his arms Brunhild and Chrimhild together!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Crowning the young girl’s breast was a cameo, and the skill of some
      cunning artist out of Welschland had wrought on it the story of the
      Drachenfels. Her bosom heaved the battle up and down.
    </p>
<p>
      This cameo was a north star to German manhood, but caused many chaste
      expressions of abhorrence from Aunt Lisbeth, Gottlieb’s unmarried sister,
      who seemed instinctively to take part with the Dragon. She was a
      frail-fashioned little lady, with a face betokening the perpetual smack of
      lemon, and who reigned in her brother’s household when the good wife was
      gone. Margarita’s robustness was beginning to alarm and shock Aunt
      Lisbeth’s sealed stock of virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She must be watched, such a madl as that,’ said Aunt Lisbeth. ‘Ursula!
      what limbs she has!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita was watched; but the spy being neither foe nor friend, nothing
      was discovered against her. This did not satisfy Aunt Lisbeth, whose own
      suspicion was her best witness. She allowed that Margarita dissembled
      well.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But,’ said she to her niece, ‘though it is good in a girl not to flaunt
      these naughtinesses in effrontery, I care for you too much not to say—Be
      what you seem, my little one!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And that am I!’ exclaimed Margarita, starting up and towering.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Right good, my niece,’ Lisbeth squealed; ‘but now Frau Groschen lies in
      God’s acre, you owe your duty to me, mind! Did you confess last week?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘From beginning to end,’ replied Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth fixed pious reproach on Margarita’s cameo.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And still you wear that thing?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not?’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Girl! who would bid you set it in such a place save Satan? Oh, thou poor
      lost child! that the eyes of the idle youths may be drawn there! and thou
      become his snare to others, Margarita! What was that Welsh wandering
      juggler but the foul fiend himself, mayhap, thou maiden of sin! They say
      he has been seen in Cologne lately. He was swarthy as Satan and limped of
      one leg. Good Master in heaven, protect us! it was Satan himself I could
      swear!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth crossed brow and breast.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita had commenced fingering the cameo, as if to tear it away; but
      Aunt Lisbeth’s finish made her laugh outright.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where I see no harm, aunty, I shall think the good God is,’ she answered;
      ‘and where I see there’s harm, I shall think Satan lurks.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A simper of sour despair passed over Aunt Lisbeth. She sighed, and was
      silent, being one of those very weak reeds who are easily vanquished and
      never overcome.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let us go on with the Tapestry, child,’ said she.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, Margarita was ambitious of completing a certain Tapestry for
      presentation to Kaiser Heinrich on his entry into Cologne after his last
      campaign on the turbaned Danube. The subject was again her beloved
      Siegfried slaying the Dragon on Drachenfels. Whenever Aunt Lisbeth
      indulged in any bitter virginity, and was overmatched by Margarita’s frank
      maidenhood, she hung out this tapestry as a flag of truce. They were
      working it in bits, not having contrivances to do it in a piece. Margarita
      took Siegfried and Aunt Lisbeth the Dragon. They shared the crag between
      them. A roguish gleam of the Rhine toward Nonnenwerth could be already
      made out, Roland’s Corner hanging like a sentinel across the chanting
      island, as one top-heavy with long watch.
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth was a great proficient in the art, and had taught Margarita.
      The little lady learnt it, with many other gruesome matters, in the
      Palatine of Bohemia’s family. She usually talked of the spectres of
      Hollenbogenblitz Castle in the passing of the threads. Those were dismal
      spectres in Bohemia, smelling of murder and the charnel-breath of
      midnight. They uttered noises that wintered the blood, and revealed sights
      that stiffened hair three feet long; ay, and kept it stiff!
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita placed herself on a settle by the low-arched window, and Aunt
      Lisbeth sat facing her. An evening sun blazoned the buttresses of the
      Cathedral, and shadowed the workframes of the peaceful couple to a
      temperate light. Margarita unrolled a sampler sheathed with twists of
      divers coloured threads, and was soon busy silver-threading Siegfried’s
      helm and horns.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I told you of the steward, poor Kraut, did I not, child?’ inquired Aunt
      Lisbeth, quietly clearing her throat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Many times!’ said Margarita, and went on humming over her knee
    </p>
<pre>
             ‘Her love was a Baron,
              A Baron so bold;
             She loved him for love,
              He loved her for gold.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘He must see for himself, and be satisfied,’ continued Aunt Lisbeth; ‘and
      Holy Thomas to warn him for an example! Poor Kraut!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poor Kraut!’ echoed Margarita.
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘The King loved wine, and the Knight loved wine,
         And they loved the summer weather:
        They might have loved each other well,
         But for one they loved together.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘You may say, poor Kraut, child!’ said Aunt Lisbeth. ‘Well! his face was
      before that as red as this dragon’s jaw, and ever after he went about as
      white as a pullet’s egg. That was something wonderful!’ ‘That was it!’ 
      chimed Margarita.
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘O the King he loved his lawful wife,
            The Knight a lawless lady:
          And ten on one-made ringing strife,
            Beneath the forest shady.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘Fifty to one, child!’ said Aunt Lisbeth: ‘You forget the story. They made
      Kraut sit with them at the jabbering feast, the only mortal there. The
      walls were full of eye-sockets without eyes, but phosphorus instead,
      burning blue and damp.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not to-night, aunty dear! It frightens me so,’ pleaded Margarita, for she
      saw the dolor coming.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Night! when it’s broad mid-day, thou timid one! Good heaven take pity on
      such as thou! The dish was seven feet in length by four broad. Kraut
      measured it with his eye, and never forgot it. Not he! When the dish-cover
      was lifted, there he saw himself lying, boiled!
    </p>
<p>
      “‘I did not feel uncomfortable then,” Kraut told us. “It seemed natural.”
     </p>
<p>
      ‘His face, as it lay there, he says, was quite calm, only a little
      wrinkled, and piggish-looking-like. There was the mole on his chin, and
      the pucker under his left eyelid. Well! the Baron carved. All the guests
      were greedy for a piece of him. Some cried out for breast; some for toes.
      It was shuddering cold to sit and hear that! The Baroness said, “Cheek!”’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ shrieked Margarita, ‘that can I not bear! I will not hear it, aunt;
      I will not!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Cheek!’ Aunt Lisbeth reiterated, nodding to the floor.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita put her fingers to her ears.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Still, Kraut says, even then he felt nothing odd. Of course he was
      horrified to be sitting with spectres as you and I should be; but the
      first tremble of it was over. He had plunged into the bath of horrors, and
      there he was. I ‘ve heard that you must pronounce the names of the Virgin
      and Trinity, sprinkling water round you all the while for three minutes;
      and if you do this without interruption, everything shall disappear. So
      they say. “Oh! dear heaven of mercy!” says Kraut, “what I felt when the
      Baron laid his long hunting-knife across my left cheek!”’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Here Aunt Lisbeth lifted her eyes to dote upon Margarita’s fright. She was
      very displeased to find her niece, with elbows on the window-sill and
      hands round her head, quietly gazing into the street.
    </p>
<p>
      She said severely, ‘Where did you learn that song you were last singing,
      Margarita? Speak, thou girl!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita laughed.
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘The thrush, and the lark, and the blackbird,
         They taught me how to sing:
        And O that the hawk would lend his eye,
         And the eagle lend his wing.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘I will not hear these shameless songs,’ exclaimed Aunt Lisbeth.
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘For I would view the lands they view,
         And be where they have been:
        It is not enough to be singing
         For ever in dells unseen!’ 
</pre>
<p>
      A voice was heard applauding her. ‘Good! right good! Carol again,
      Gretelchen! my birdie!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita turned, and beheld her father in the doorway. She tripped toward
      him, and heartily gave him their kiss of meeting. Gottlieb glanced at the
      helm of Siegfried.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Guessed the work was going well; you sing so lightsomely to-day, Grete!
      Very pretty! And that’s Drachenfels? Bones of the Virgins! what a bold
      fellow was Siegfried, and a lucky, to have the neatest lass in Deutschland
      in love with him. Well, we must marry her to Siegfried after all, I
      believe! Aha? or somebody as good as Siegfried. So chirrup on, my
      darling!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aunt Lisbeth does not approve of my songs,’ replied Margarita, untwisting
      some silver threads.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do thy father’s command, girl!’ said Aunt Lisbeth.
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘And doing his command,
            Should I do a thing of ill,
          I’d rather die to his lovely face,
            Than wanton at his will.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘There—there,’ said Aunt Lisbeth, straining out her fingers; ‘you
      see, Gottlieb, what over-indulgence brings her to. Not another girl in
      blessed Rhineland, and Bohemia to boot, dared say such words!—than—I
      can’t repeat them!—don’t ask me!—She’s becoming a Frankish
      girl!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What ballad’s that?’ said Gottlieb, smiling.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Ballad of Holy Ottilia; and her lover was sold to darkness. And she
      loved him—loved him——’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As you love Siegfried, you little one?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘More, my father; for she saw Winkried, and I never saw Siegfried. Ah! if
      I had seen Siegfried! Never mind. She loved him; but she loved Virtue
      more. And Virtue is the child of God, and the good God forgave her for
      loving Winkried, the Devil’s son, because she loved Virtue more, and He
      rescued her as she was being dragged down—down—down, and was
      half fainting with the smell of brimstone—rescued her and had her
      carried into His Glory, head and feet, on the wings of angels, before all
      men, as a hope to little maidens.
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘And when I thought that I was lost
            I found that I was saved,
          And I was borne through blessed clouds,
            Where the banners of bliss were waved.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘And so you think you, too, may fall in, love with Devils’ sons, girl?’ 
      was Aunt Lisbeth’s comment.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do look at Lisbeth’s Dragon, little Heart! it’s so like!’ said Margarita
      to her father.
    </p>
<p>
      Old Gottlieb twitted his hose, and chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She’s my girl! that may be seen,’ said he, patting her, and wheezed up
      from his chair to waddle across to the Dragon. But Aunt Lisbeth tartly
      turned the Dragon to the wall.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is not yet finished, Gottlieb, and must not be looked at,’ she
      interposed. ‘I will call for wood, and see to a fire: these evenings of
      Spring wax cold’: and away whimpered Aunt Lisbeth.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita sang:
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘I with my playmates,
            In riot and disorder,
          Were gathering herb and blossom
            Along the forest border.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘Thy mother’s song, child of my heart!’ said Gottlieb; ‘but vex not good
      Lisbeth: she loves thee!’ 
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘And do you think she loves me?
            And will you say ‘tis true?
          O, and will she have me,
            When I come up to woo?’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘Thou leaping doe! thou chattering pie!’ said Gottlieb.
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘She shall have ribbons and trinkets,
            And shine like a morn of May,
          When we are off to the little hill-church,
            Our flowery bridal way.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘That she shall; and something more!’ cried Gottlieb. ‘But, hark thee,
      Gretelchen; the Kaiser will be here in three days. Thou dear one! had I
      not stored and hoarded all for thee, I should now have my feet on a
      hearthstone where even he might warm his boot. So get thy best dresses and
      jewels in order, and look thyself; proud as any in the land. A simple
      burgher’s daughter now, Grete; but so shalt thou not end, my butterfly, or
      there’s neither worth nor wit in Gottlieb Groschen!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Three days!’ Margarita exclaimed; ‘and the helm not finished, and the
      tapestry-pieces not sewed and joined, and the water not shaded off.—Oh!
      I must work night and day.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Child! I’ll have no working at night! Your rosy cheeks will soon be
      sucked out by oil-light, and you look no better than poor tallow Court
      beauties—to say nothing of the danger. This old house saw Charles
      the Great embracing the chief magistrate of his liege city yonder. Some
      swear he slept in it. He did not sneeze at smaller chambers than our
      Kaisers abide. No gold ceilings with cornice carvings, but plain wooden
      beams.’ 
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘Know that the men of great renown,
            Were men of simple needs:
          Bare to the Lord they laid them down,
            And slept on mighty deeds.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘God wot, there’s no emptying thy store of ballads, Grete: so much shall
      be said of thee. Yes; times are changeing: We’re growing degenerate. Look
      at the men of Linz now to what they were! Would they have let the lads of
      Andernach float down cabbage-stalks to them without a shy back? And why?
      All because they funk that brigand-beast Werner, who gets redemption from
      Laach, hard by his hold, whenever he commits a crime worth paying for. As
      for me, my timber and stuffs must come down stream, and are too good for
      the nixen under Rhine, or think you I would acknowledge him with a toll,
      the hell-dog? Thunder and lightning! if old scores could be rubbed out on
      his hide!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Gottlieb whirled a thong-lashing arm in air, and groaned of law and
      justice. What were they coming to!
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita softened the theme with a verse:
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘And tho’ to sting his enemy,
          Is sweetness to the angry bee,
          The angry bee must busy be,
          Ere sweet of sweetness hiveth he.
</pre>
<p>
      The arch thrill of his daughter’s voice tickled Gottlieb. ‘That’s it,
      birdie! You and the proverb are right. I don’t know which is best,
    </p>
<pre>
            ‘Better hive
             And keep alive
             Than vengeance wake
             With that you take.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      A clatter in the cathedral square brought Gottlieb on his legs to the
      window. It was a company of horsemen sparkling in harness. One trumpeter
      rode at the side of the troop, and in front a standard-bearer, matted down
      the chest with ochre beard, displayed aloft to the good citizens of
      Cologne, three brown hawks, with birds in their beaks, on an azure
      stardotted field.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Holy Cross!’ exclaimed Gottlieb, low in his throat; ‘the arms of Werner!
      Where got he money to mount his men? Why, this is daring all Cologne in
      our very teeth! ‘Fend that he visit me now! Ruin smokes in that ruffian’s
      track. I ‘ve felt hot and cold by turns all day.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The horsemen came jingling carelessly along the street in scattered twos
      and threes, laughing together, and singling out the maidens at the
      gable-shadowed windows with hawking eyes. The good citizens of Cologne did
      not look on them favourably. Some showed their backs and gruffly banged
      their doors: others scowled and pocketed their fists: not a few slunk into
      the side alleys like well-licked curs, and scurried off with forebent
      knees. They were in truth ferocious-looking fellows these trusty servants
      of the robber Baron Werner, of Werner’s Eck, behind Andernach. Leather,
      steel, and dust, clad them from head to foot; big and black as bears;
      wolf-eyed, fox-nosed. They glistened bravely in the falling beams of the
      sun, and Margarita thrust her fair braided yellow head a little forward
      over her father’s shoulder to catch the whole length of the grim
      cavalcade. One of the troop was not long in discerning the young beauty.
      He pointed her boldly out to a comrade, who approved his appetite, and
      referred her to a third. The rest followed lead, and Margarita was as one
      spell-struck when she became aware that all those hungry eyes were preying
      on hers. Old Gottlieb was too full of his own fears to think for her, and
      when he drew in his head rather suddenly, it was with a dismal foreboding
      that Werner’s destination in Cologne was direct to the house of Gottlieb
      Groschen, for purposes only too well to be divined.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Devil’s breeches!’ muttered Gottlieb; ‘look again, Grete, and see if that
      hell-troop stop the way outside.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita’s cheeks were overflowing with the offended rose.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will not look at them again, father.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Gottlieb stared, and then patted her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I would I were a man, father!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Gottlieb smiled, and stroked his beard.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! how I burn!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And the girl shivered visibly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Grete! mind to be as much of a woman as you can, and soon such raff as
      this you may sweep away, like cobwebs, and no harm done.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He was startled by a violent thumping at the streetdoor, and as brazen a
      blast as if the dead were being summoned. Aunt Lisbeth entered, and
      flitted duskily round the room, crying:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We are lost: they are upon us! better death with a bodkin! Never shall it
      be said of me; never! the monsters!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Then admonishing them to lock, bar, bolt, and block up every room in the
      house, Aunt Lisbeth perched herself on the edge of a chair, and reversed
      the habits of the screech-owl, by being silent when stationary.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There’s nothing to fear for you, Lisbeth,’ said Gottlieb, with
      discourteous emphasis.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gottlieb! do you remember what happened at the siege of Mainz? and poor
      Marthe Herbstblum, who had hoped to die as she was; and Dame Altknopfchen,
      and Frau Kaltblut, and the old baker, Hans Topf’s sister, all of them as
      holy as abbesses, and that did not save them! and nothing will from such
      godless devourers.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Gottlieb was gone, having often before heard mention of the calamity
      experienced by these fated women.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Comfort thee, good heart, on my breast,’ said Margarita, taking Lisbeth
      to that sweet nest of peace and fortitude.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Margarita! ‘tis your doing! have I not said—lure them not, for they
      swarm too early upon us! And here they are! and, perhaps, in five minutes
      all will be over!
    </p>
<p>
      Herr Je!—What, you are laughing! Heavens of goodness, the girl is
      delighted!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Here a mocking ha-ha! accompanied by a thundering snack at the door, shook
      the whole house, and again the trumpet burst the ears with fury.
    </p>
<p>
      This summons, which seemed to Aunt Lisbeth final, wrought a strange
      composure in her countenance. She was very pale, but spread her dress
      decently, as if fear had departed, and clasped her hands on her knees.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The will of the Lord above must be done,’ said she; ‘it is impious to
      complain when we are given into the hand of the Philistines. Others have
      been martyred, and were yet acceptable.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      To this heroic speech she added, with cold energy: ‘Let them come!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aunt,’ cried Margarita, ‘I hear my father’s voice with those men. Aunty!
      I will not let him be alone. I must go down to him. You will be safe here.
      I shall come to you if there’s cause for alarm.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And in spite of Aunt Lisbeth’s astonished shriek of remonstrance, she
      hurried off to rejoin Gottlieb.
    </p>

<h2>
      THE WAGER
    </h2>
<p>
      Ere Margarita had reached the landing of the stairs, she repented her
      haste and shrank back. Wrapt in a thunder of oaths, she distinguished:
      ‘‘Tis the little maiden we want; let’s salute her and begone! or cap your
      skull with something thicker than you’ve on it now, if you want a whole
      one, happy father!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gottlieb von Groschen I am,’ answered her father, ‘and the Kaiser——’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘‘S as fond of a pretty girl as we are! Down with her, and no more
      drivelling! It’s only for a moment, old Measure and Scales!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I tell you, rascals, I know your master, and if you’re not punished for
      this, may I die a beggar!’ exclaimed Gottlieb, jumping with rage.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May you die as rich as an abbot! And so you will, if you don’t bring her
      down, for I’ve sworn to see her; there ‘s the end of it, man!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ll see, too, if the laws allow this villany!’ cried Gottlieb.
      ‘Insulting a peaceful citizen! in his own house! a friend of your emperor!
      Gottlieb von Groschen!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Groschen? We’re cousins, then! You wouldn’t shut out your nearest kin?
      Devil’s lightning! Don’t you know me? Pfennig? Von Pfennig! This here’s
      Heller: that’s Zwanziger: all of us Vons, every soul! You’re not decided?
      This’ll sharpen you, my jolly King Paunch!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And Margarita heard the ruffian step as if to get swing for a blow. She
      hurried into the passage, and slipping in front of her father, said to his
      assailant:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have asked for me! I am here!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her face was colourless, and her voice seemed to issue from between a
      tightened cord. She stood with her left foot a little in advance, and her
      whole body heaving and quivering: her arms folded and pressed hard below
      her bosom: her eyes dilated to a strong blue: her mouth ashy white. A
      strange lustre, as of suppressed internal fire, flickered over her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My name ‘s Schwartz Thier, and so ‘s my nature!’ said the fellow with a
      grin; ‘but may I never smack lips with a pretty girl again, if I harm such
      a young beauty as this! Friendly dealing’s my plan o’ life.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Clear out of my house, then, fellow, and here’s money for you,’ said
      Gottlieb, displaying a wrathfully-trembling handful of coin.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pish! money! forty times that wouldn’t cover my bet! And if it did?
      Shouldn’t I be disgraced? jeered at for a sheep-heart? No, I’m no ninny,
      and not to be diddled. I’ll talk to the young lady! Silence, out there!
      all’s going proper’: this to his comrades through the door. ‘So, my
      beautiful maiden! thus it stands: We saw you at the window, looking like a
      fresh rose with a gold crown on. Here are we poor fellows come to welcome
      the Kaiser. I began to glorify you. “Schwartz Thier!” says Henker Rothhals
      to me, “I’ll wager you odds you don’t have a kiss of that fine girl within
      twenty minutes, counting from the hand-smack!” Done! was my word, and we
      clapped our fists together. Now, you see, that’s straightforward! All I
      want is, not to lose my money and be made a fool of—leaving alone
      that sugary mouth which makes mine water’; and he drew the back of his
      hand along his stubbled jaws: ‘So, come! don’t hesitate! no harm to you,
      my beauty, but a compliment, and Schwartz Thier’s your friend and anything
      else you like for ever after. Come, time’s up, pretty well.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita leaned to her father a moment as if mortal sickness had seized
      her. Then cramping her hands and feet, she said in his ear, ‘Leave me to
      my own care; go, get the men to protect thee’; and ordered Schwartz Thier
      to open the door wide.
    </p>
<p>
      Seeing Gottlieb would not leave her, she joined her hands, and begged him.
      ‘The good God will protect me! I will overmatch these men. Look, my
      father! they dare not strike me in the street: you they would fell without
      pity. Go! what they dare in a house, they dare not in the street.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Schwartz Thier had opened the door. At sight of Margarita, the troop gave
      a shout.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now! on the doorstep, full in view, my beauteous one! that they may see
      what a lucky devil I am—and have no doubts about the handing over.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita looked behind. Gottlieb was still there, every member of him
      quaking like a bog under a heavy heel. She ran to him. ‘My father! I have
      a device wilt thou spoil it, and give me to this beast? You can do
      nothing, nothing! protect yourself and save me!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Cologne! broad day!’ muttered Gottlieb, as if the enormity had prostrated
      his belief in facts; and moved slowly back.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita strode to the door-step. Schwartz Thier was awaiting her, his
      arm circled out, and his leering face ducked to a level with his victim’s.
      This rough show of gallantry proved costly to him. As he was gently
      closing his iron hold about her, enjoying before hand with grim
      mouthridges the flatteries of triumph, Margarita shot past him through the
      door, and was already twenty paces beyond the troop before either of them
      thought of pursuing her. At the first sound of a hoof, Henker Rothhals
      seized the rider’s bridle-rein, and roared: ‘Fair play for a fair bet!
      leave all to the Thier!’ The Thier, when he had recovered from his
      amazement, sought for old Gottlieb to give him a back-hit, as Margarita
      foresaw that he would. Not finding him at hand, out lumbered the fellow as
      swiftly as his harness would allow, and caught a glimpse of Margarita
      rapidly fleeting up the cathedral square.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only five minutes, Schwartz Thier!’ some of the troop sung out.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The devil can do his business in one,’ was the retort, and Schwartz Thier
      swung himself on his broad-backed charger, and gored the fine beast till
      she rattled out a blast of sparkles from the flint.
    </p>
<p>
      In a minute he drew up in front of Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So! you prefer settling this business in the square.
    </p>
<p>
      Good! my choice sweetheart!’ and he sprang to her side.
    </p>
<p>
      The act of flight had touched the young girl’s heart with the spirit of
      flight. She crouched like a winded hare under the nose of the hound, and
      covered her face with her two hands. Margarita was no wisp in weight, but
      Schwartz Thier had her aloft in his arm as easily as if he had tossed up a
      kerchief.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Look all, and witness!’ he shouted, lifting the other arm.
    </p>
<p>
      Henker Rothhals and the rest of the troop looked, as they came trotting to
      the scene, with the coolness of umpires: but they witnessed something
      other than what Schwartz Thier proposed. This was the sight of a
      formidable staff, whirling an unfriendly halo over the head of the Thier,
      and descending on it with such honest intent to confound and overthrow
      him, that the Thier succumbed to its force without argument, and the
      square echoed blow and fall simultaneously. At the same time the wielder
      of this sound piece of logic seized Margarita, and raised a shout in the
      square for all true men to stand by him in rescuing a maiden from the
      clutch of brigands and ravishers. A crowd was collecting, but seemed to
      consider the circle now formed by the horsemen as in a manner charmed, for
      only one, a fair slender youth, came forward and ranged himself beside the
      stranger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Take thou the maiden: I’ll keep to the staff,’ said this latter,
      stumbling over his speech as if he was in a foreign land among old roots
      and wolfpits which had already shaken out a few of his teeth, and made him
      cautious about the remainder.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Can it be Margarita!’ exclaimed the youth, bending to her, and calling to
      her: ‘Margarita! Fraulein Groschen!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She opened her eyes, shuddered, and said: ‘I was not afraid! Am I safe?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Safe while I have life, and this good friend.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where is my father?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have not seen him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you—who are you? Do I owe this to you?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! no! no! Me you owe nothing.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita gazed hurriedly round, and at her feet there lay the Thier with
      his steel-cap shining in dints, and three rivulets of blood coursing down
      his mottled forehead. She looked again at the youth, and a blush of
      recognition gave life to her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I did not know you. Pardon me. Farina! what thanks can reward such
      courage! Tell me! shall we go?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The youth eyed her an instant, but recovering himself, took a rapid
      survey, and called to the stranger to follow and help give the young
      maiden safe conduct home.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just then Henker Rothhals bellowed, ‘Time’s up!’ He was answered by a
      chorus of agreement from the troop. They had hitherto patiently acted
      their parts as spectators, immovable on their horses. The assault on the
      Thier was all in the play, and a visible interference of fortune in favour
      of Henker Rothhals. Now general commotion shuttled them, and the
      stranger’s keen hazel eyes read their intentions rightly when he lifted
      his redoubtable staff in preparation for another mighty swoop, this time
      defensive. Rothhals, and half a dozen others, with a war-cry of curses,
      spurred their steeds at once to ride him down. They had not reckoned the
      length and good-will of their antagonist’s weapon. Scarce were they in
      motion, when round it whizzed, grazing the nostrils of their horses with a
      precision that argued practice in the feat, and unhorsing two, Rothhals
      among the number. He dropped heavily on his head, and showed signs of
      being as incapable of combat as the Thier. A cheer burst from the crowd,
      but fell short.
    </p>
<p>
      The foremost of their number was struck flat to the earth by a fellow of
      the troop.
    </p>
<p>
      Calling on St. George, his patron saint, the stranger began systematically
      to make a clear ring in his path forward. Several of the horsemen essayed
      a cut at his arm with their long double-handed swords, but the horses
      could not be brought a second time to the edge of the magic circle; and
      the blood of these warriors being thoroughly up, they now came at him on
      foot. In their rage they would have made short work with the three, in
      spite of the magistracy of Cologne, had they not been arrested by cries of
      ‘Werner! Werner!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      At the South-west end of the square, looking Rhinewards, rode the marauder
      Baron, in full armour, helm and hauberk, with a single retainer in his
      rear. He had apparently caught sight of the brawl, and, either because he
      distinguished his own men, or was seeking his natural element, hastened up
      for his share in it, which was usually that of the king of beasts. His
      first call was for Schwartz Thier. The men made way, and he beheld his man
      in no condition to make military responses. He shouted for Henker
      Rothhals, and again the men opened their ranks mutely, exhibiting the two
      stretched out in diverse directions, with their feet slanting to a common
      point. The Baron glared; then caught off his mailed glove, and thrust it
      between his teeth. A rasping gurgle of oaths was all they heard, and
      presently surged up,
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who was it?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita’s eyes were shut. She opened them fascinated with horror. There
      was an unearthly awful and comic mixture of sounds in Werner’s querulous
      fury, that was like the noise of a complaining bear, rolling up from
      hollow-chested menace to yawning lament. Never in her life had Margarita
      such a shock of fear. The half gasp of a laugh broke on her trembling
      lips. She stared at Werner, and was falling; but Farina’s arm clung
      instantly round her waist. The stranger caught up her laugh, loud and
      hearty.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As for who did it, Sir Baron,’ he cried, is a cheery tone, ‘I am the man!
      As you may like to know why—and that’s due to you and me both of us—all
      I can say is, the Black Muzzle yonder lying got his settler for
      merry-making with this peaceful maiden here, without her consent—an
      offence in my green island they reckon a crack o’ the sconce light basting
      for, I warrant all company present,’ and he nodded sharply about. ‘As for
      the other there, who looks as if a rope had been round his neck once and
      shirked its duty, he counts his wages for helping the devil in his
      business, as will any other lad here who likes to come on and try.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Werner himself, probably, would have given him the work he wanted; but his
      eye had sidled a moment over Margarita, and the hardly-suppressed applause
      of the crowd at the stranger’s speech failed to bring his ire into action
      this solitary time.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who is the maiden?’ he asked aloud.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Fraulein von Groschen,’ replied Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Von Groschen! Von Groschen! the daughter of Gottlieb Groschen?—Rascals!’ 
      roared the Baron, turning on his men, and out poured a mud-spring of
      filthy oaths and threats, which caused Henker Rothhals, who had opened his
      eyes, to close them again, as if he had already gone to the place of heat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only lend me thy staff, friend,’ cried Werner.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not I! thwack ‘em with your own wood,’ replied the stranger, and fell
      back a leg.
    </p>
<p>
      Werner knotted his stringy brows, and seemed torn to pieces with the
      different pulling tides of his wrath. He grasped the mane of his horse and
      flung abroad handfuls, till the splendid animal reared in agony.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You shall none of you live over this night, villains! I ‘ll hang you,
      every hag’s son! My last orders were,—Keep quiet in the city, ye
      devil’s brood. Take that! and that!’ laying at them with his bare sword.
      ‘Off with you, and carry these two pigs out of sight quickly, or I’ll have
      their heads, and make sure o’ them.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The latter injunction sprang from policy, for at the head of the chief
      street there was a glitter of the city guard, marching with shouldered
      spears.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Maiden,’ said Werner, with a bull’s bow, ‘let me conduct thee to thy
      father.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita did not reply; but gave her hand to Farina, and took a step
      closer to the stranger.
    </p>
<p>
      Werner’s brows grew black.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Enough to have saved you, fair maid,’ he muttered hoarsely. ‘Gratitude
      never was a woman’s gift. Say to your father that I shall make excuses to
      him for the conduct of my men.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Whereupon, casting a look of leisurely scorn toward the guard coming up in
      the last beams of day, the Baron shrugged his huge shoulders to an
      altitude expressing the various contemptuous shades of feudal coxcombry,
      stuck one leather-ruffled arm in his side, and jolted off at an easy pace.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Amen!’ ejaculated the stranger, leaning on his staff. ‘There are Barons
      in my old land; but never a brute beast in harness.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita stood before him, and took his two hands.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will come with me to my father! He will thank you. I cannot. You will
      come?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Tears and a sob of relief started from her.
    </p>
<p>
      The city guard, on seeing Werner’s redoubtable back turned, had adopted
      double time, and now came panting up, while the stranger bent smiling
      under a fresh overflow of innocent caresses. Margarita was caught to her
      father’s breast.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You shall have vengeance for this, sweet chuck,’ cried old Gottlieb in
      the intervals of his hugs.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Fear not, my father; they are punished’: and Margarita related the story
      of the stranger’s prowess, elevating him into a second Siegfried. The
      guard huzzaed him, but did not pursue the Baron.
    </p>
<p>
      Old Gottlieb, without hesitation, saluted the astonished champion with a
      kiss on either cheek.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My best friend! You have saved my daughter from indignity! Come with us
      home, if you can believe that a home where the wolves come daring us,
      dragging our dear ones from our very doorsteps. Come, that we may thank
      you under a roof at least. My little daughter! Is she not a brave lass?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She’s nothing less than the white rose of Germany,’ said the stranger,
      with a good bend of the shoulders to Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So she’s called,’ exclaimed Gottlieb; ‘she ‘s worthy to be a man!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Men would be the losers, then, more than they could afford,’ replied the
      stranger, with a ringing laugh.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come, good friend,’ said Gottlieb; ‘you must need refreshment. Prove you
      are a true hero by your appetite. As Charles the Great said to Archbishop
      Turpin, “I conquered the world because Nature gave me a gizzard; for
      everywhere the badge of subjection is a poor stomach.” Come, all! A day
      well ended, notwithstanding!’

<h2>
      THE SILVER ARROW
    </h2>
<p>
      At the threshold of Gottlieb’s house a number of the chief burgesses of
      Cologne had corporated spontaneously to condole with him. As he came near,
      they raised a hubbub of gratulation. Strong were the expressions of
      abhorrence and disgust of Werner’s troop in which these excellent citizens
      clothed their outraged feelings; for the insult to Gottlieb was the insult
      of all. The Rhinestream taxes were provoking enough to endure; but that
      the licence of these free-booting bands should extend to the homes of free
      and peaceful men, loyal subjects of the Emperor, was a sign that the evil
      had reached from pricks to pokes, as the saying went, and must now be met
      as became burgesses of ancient Cologne, and by joint action destroyed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In! in, all of you!’ said Gottlieb, broadening his smile to suit the
      many. ‘We ‘ll talk about that in-doors. Meantime, I’ve got a hero to
      introduce to you: flesh and blood! no old woman’s coin and young girl’s
      dream-o’day: the honest thing, and a rarity, my masters. All that over
      some good Rhine-juice from above Bacharach. In, and welcome, friends!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Gottlieb drew the stranger along with him under the carved old oak-wood
      portals, and the rest paired, and reverentially entered in his wake.
      Margarita, to make up for this want of courtesy, formed herself the last
      of the procession. She may have had another motive, for she took occasion
      there to whisper something to Farina, bringing sun and cloud over his
      countenance in rapid flushes. He seemed to remonstrate in dumb show; but
      she, with an attitude of silence, signified her wish to seal the
      conversation, and he drooped again. On the door step she paused a moment,
      and hung her head pensively, as if moved by a reminiscence. The youth had
      hurried away some strides. Margarita looked after him. His arms were
      straightened to his flanks, his hands clenched, and straining out from the
      wrist. He had the aspect of one tugging against the restraint of a chain
      that suddenly let out link by link to his whole force.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Farina!’ she called; and wound him back with a run. ‘Farina! You do not
      think me ungrateful? I could not tell my father in the crowd what you did
      for me. He shall know. He will thank you. He does not understand you now,
      Farina. He will. Look not so sorrowful. So much I would say to you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      So much was rushing on her mind, that her maidenly heart became unruly,
      and warned her to beware.
    </p>
<p>
      The youth stood as if listening to a nightingale of the old woods, after
      the first sweet stress of her voice was in his ear. When she ceased, he
      gazed into her eyes. They were no longer deep and calm like forest lakes;
      the tender-glowing blue quivered, as with a spark of the young girl’s
      soul, in the beams of the moon then rising.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, Margarita!’ said the youth, in tones that sank to sighs: ‘what am I
      to win your thanks, though it were my life for such a boon!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He took her hand, and she did not withdraw it. Twice his lips dwelt upon
      those pure fingers.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Margarita: you forgive me: I have been so long without hope. I have
      kissed your hand, dearest of God’s angels!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She gently restrained the full white hand in his pressure.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Margarita! I have thought never before death to have had this sacred
      bliss. I am guerdoned in advance for every grief coming before death.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She dropped on him one look of a confiding softness that was to the youth
      like the opened gate of the innocent garden of her heart.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You pardon me, Margarita? I may call you my beloved? strive, wait, pray,
      hope, for you, my star of life?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her face was so sweet a charity!
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dear love! one word!—or say nothing, but remain, and move not. So
      beautiful you are! Oh, might I kneel to you here; dote on you; worship
      this white hand for ever.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The colour had passed out of her cheeks like a blissful western red
      leaving rich paleness in the sky; and with her clear brows levelled at
      him, her bosom lifting more and more rapidly, she struggled against the
      charm that was on her, and at last released her hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must go. I cannot stay. Pardon you? Who might not be proud of your
      love!—Farewell!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She turned to move away, but lingered a step from him, hastily touching
      her bosom and either hand, as if to feel for a brooch or a ring. Then she
      blushed, drew the silver arrow from the gathered gold-shot braids above
      her neck, held it out to him, and was gone.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina clutched the treasure, and reeled into the street. Half a dozen
      neighbours were grouped by the door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What ‘s the matter in Master Groschen’s house now?’ one asked, as he
      plunged into the midst of them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Matter?’ quoth the joy-drunken youth, catching at the word, and mused off
      into raptures; ‘There never was such happiness! ‘Tis paradise within,
      exile without. But what exile! A star ever in the heavens to lighten the
      road and cheer the path of the banished one’; and he loosened his vest and
      hugged the cold shaft on his breast.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What are you talking and capering at, fellow?’ exclaimed another: ‘Can’t
      you answer about those shrieks, like a Christian, you that have just come
      out of the house? Why, there’s shrieking now! It ‘s a woman. Thousand
      thunders! it sounds like the Frau Lisbeth’s voice. What can be happening
      to her?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps she’s on fire,’ was coolly suggested between two or three.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pity to see the old house burnt,’ remarked one.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘House! The woman, man! the woman!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ replied the other, an ancient inhabitant of Cologne, shaking his
      head, ‘the house is oldest!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina, now recovering his senses, heard shrieks that he recognized as
      possible in the case of Aunt Lisbeth dreading the wickedness of an
      opposing sex, and alarmed by the inrush of old Gottlieb’s numerous guests.
      To confirm him, she soon appeared, and hung herself halfway out of one of
      the upper windows, calling desperately to St. Ursula for aid. He thanked
      the old lady in his heart for giving him a pretext to enter Paradise
      again; but before even love could speed him, Frau Lisbeth was seized and
      dragged remorselessly out of sight, and he and the rosy room darkened
      together.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina twice strode off to the Rhine-stream; as many times he returned. It
      was hard to be away from her. It was harder to be near and not close. His
      heart flamed into jealousy of the stranger. Everything threatened to
      overturn his slight but lofty structure of bliss so suddenly shot into the
      heavens. He had but to remember that his hand was on the silver arrow, and
      a radiance broke upon his countenance, and a calm fell upon his breast.
      ‘It was a plight of her troth to me,’ mused the youth. ‘She loves me! She
      would not trust her frank heart to speak. Oh, generous young girl! what am
      I to dare hope for such a prize? for I never can be worthy. And she is one
      who, giving her heart, gives it all. Do I not know her? How lovely she
      looked thanking the stranger! The blue of her eyes, the warm-lighted blue,
      seemed to grow full on the closing lids, like heaven’s gratitude. Her
      beauty is wonderful. What wonder, then, if he loves her? I should think
      him a squire in his degree. There are squires of high birth and low.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      So mused Farina with his arms folded and his legs crossed in the shadow of
      Margarita’s chamber. Gradually he fell into a kind of hazy doze. The
      houses became branded with silver arrows. All up the Cathedral stone was a
      glitter, and dance, and quiver of them. In the sky mazed confusion of
      arrowy flights and falls. Farina beheld himself in the service of the
      Emperor watching these signs, and expecting on the morrow to win glory and
      a name for Margarita. Glory and the name now won, old Gottlieb was just on
      the point of paternally blessing them, when a rude pat aroused him from
      the delicious moon-dream.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hero by day! house-guard by night! That tells a tale,’ said a cheerful
      voice.
    </p>
<p>
      The moon was shining down the Cathedral square and street, and Farina saw
      the stranger standing solid and ruddy before him. He was at first prompted
      to resent such familiar handling, but the stranger’s face was of that
      bland honest nature which, like the sun, wins everywhere back a reflection
      of its own kindliness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are right,’ replied Farina; ‘so it is!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pretty wines inside there, and a rare young maiden. She has a throat like
      a nightingale, and more ballads at command than a piper’s wallet. Now, if
      I hadn’t a wife at home.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’re married?’ cried Farina, seizing the stranger’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Surely; and my lass can say something for herself on the score of brave
      looks, as well as the best of your German maids here, trust me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina repressed an inclination to perform a few of those antics which
      violent joy excites, and after rushing away and back, determined to give
      his secret to the stranger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Look,’ said he in a whisper, that opens the private doors of a
      confidence.
    </p>
<p>
      But the stranger repeated the same word still more earnestly, and brought
      Farina’s eyes on a couple of dark figures moving under the Cathedral.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Some lamb’s at stake when the wolves are prowling,’ he added: ‘‘Tis now
      two hours to the midnight. I doubt if our day’s work be over till we hear
      the chime, friend.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What interest do you take in the people of this house that you watch over
      them thus?’ asked Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      The stranger muffled a laugh in his beard.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘An odd question, good sooth. Why, in the first place, we like well whatso
      we have done good work for. That goes for something. In the second, I’ve
      broken bread in this house. Put down that in the reckoning. In the third;
      well! in the third, add up all together, and the sum total’s at your
      service, young sir.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina marked him closely. There was not a spot on his face for guile to
      lurk in, or suspicion to fasten on. He caught the stranger’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You called me friend just now. Make me your friend. Look, I was going to
      say: I love this maiden! I would die for her. I have loved her long. This
      night she has given me a witness that my love is not vain. I am poor. She
      is rich. I am poor, I said, and feel richer than the Kaiser with this she
      has given me! Look, it is what our German girls slide in their back-hair,
      this silver arrow!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A very pretty piece of heathenish wear!’ exclaimed the stranger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, I was going to say—tell me, friend, of a way to win honour
      and wealth quickly; I care not at how rare a risk. Only to wealth, or high
      baronry, will her father give her!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The stranger buzzed on his moustache in a pause of cool pity, such as
      elders assume when young men talk of conquering the world for their
      mistresses: and in truth it is a calm of mind well won!
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Things look so brisk at home here in the matter of the maiden, that I
      should say, wait a while and watch your chance. But you’re a boy of pluck:
      I serve in the Kaiser’s army, under my lord: the Kaiser will be here in
      three days. If you ‘re of that mind then, I doubt little you may get
      posted well: but, look again! there’s a ripe brew yonder. Marry, you may
      win your spurs this night even; who knows?—‘S life! there’s a tall
      fellow joining those two lurkers.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Can you see into the murk shadow, Sir Squire?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay! thanks to your Styrian dungeons, where I passed a year’s
      apprenticeship:
    </p>
<pre>
       “I learnt to watch the rats and mice
         At play, with never a candle-end.
        They play’d so well; they sang so nice;
         They dubb’d me comrade; called me friend!”
 </pre>
<p>
      So says the ballad of our red-beard king’s captivity. All evil has a good:
    </p>
<pre>
       “When our toes and chins are up,
        Poison plants make sweetest cup”
 </pre>
<p>
      as the old wives mumble to us when we’re sick. Heigho! would I were in the
      little island well home again, though that were just their song of welcome
      to me, as I am a Christian.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tell me your name, friend,’ said Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Guy’s my name, young man: Goshawk’s my title. Guy the Goshawk! so they
      called me in my merry land. The cap sticks when it no longer fits. Then I
      drove the arrow, and was down on my enemy ere he could ruffle a feather.
      Now, what would be my nickname?
    </p>
<pre>
       “A change so sad, and a change so bad,
         Might set both Christian and heathen a sighing:
        Change is a curse, for it’s all for the worse:
         Age creeps up, and youth is flying!”
 </pre>
<p>
      and so on, with the old song. But here am I, and yonder’s a game that
      wants harrying; so we’ll just begin to nose about them a bit.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He crossed to the other side of the street, and Farina followed out of the
      moonlight. The two figures and the taller one were evidently observing
      them; for they also changed their position and passed behind an angle of
      the Cathedral.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tell me how the streets cross all round the Cathedral you know the city,’ 
      said the stranger, holding out his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina traced with his finger a rough map of the streets on the stranger’s
      hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good! that’s how my lord always marks the battlefield, and makes me show
      him the enemy’s posts. Forward, this way!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He turned from the Cathedral, and both slid along close under the eaves
      and front hangings of the houses. Neither spoke. Farina felt that he was
      in the hands of a skilful captain, and only regretted the want of a weapon
      to make harvest of the intended surprise; for he judged clearly that those
      were fellows of Werner’s band on the look-out. They wound down numberless
      intersections of narrow streets with irregular-built houses standing or
      leaning wry-faced in row, here a quaint-beamed cottage, there almost a
      mansion with gilt arms, brackets, and devices. Oil-lamps unlit hung at
      intervals by the corners, near a pale Christ on crucifix. Across the
      passages they hung alight. The passages and alleys were too dusky and
      close for the moon in her brightest ardour to penetrate; down the streets
      a slender lane of white beams could steal: ‘In all conscience,’ as the
      good citizens of Cologne declared, ‘enough for those heathen hounds and
      sons of the sinful who are abroad when God’s own blessed lamp is out.’ So,
      when there was a moon, the expense of oil was saved to the Cologne
      treasury, thereby satisfying the virtuous.
    </p>
<p>
      After incessant doubling here and there, listening to footfalls, and
      themselves eluding a chase which their suspicious movements aroused, they
      came upon the Rhine. A full flood of moonlight burnished the knightly
      river in glittering scales, and plates, and rings, as headlong it rolled
      seaward on from under crag and banner of old chivalry and rapine. Both
      greeted the scene with a burst of pleasure. The grey mist of flats on the
      south side glimmered delightful to their sight, coming from that drowsy
      crowd and press of habitations; but the solemn glory of the river,
      delaying not, heedless, impassioned-pouring on in some sublime conference
      between it and heaven to the great marriage of waters, deeply shook
      Farina’s enamoured heart. The youth could not restrain his tears, as if a
      magic wand had touched him. He trembled with love; and that delicate bliss
      which maiden hope first showers upon us like a silver rain when she has
      taken the shape of some young beauty and plighted us her fair fleeting
      hand, tenderly embraced him.
    </p>
<p>
      As they were emerging into the spaces of the moon, a cheer from the
      stranger arrested Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Seest thou? on the wharf there! that is the very one, the tallest of the
      three. Lakin! but we shall have him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Wrapt in a long cloak, with low pointed cap and feather, stood the person
      indicated. He appeared to be meditating on the flow of the water, unaware
      of hostile presences, or quite regardless of them. There was a majesty in
      his height and air, which made the advance of the two upon him more wary
      and respectful than their first impulse had counselled. They could not
      read his features, which were mantled behind voluminous folds: all save a
      pair of very strange eyes, that, even as they gazed directly downward,
      seemed charged with restless fiery liquid.
    </p>
<p>
      The two were close behind him: Guy the Goshawk prepared for one of those
      fatal pounces on the foe that had won him his title. He consulted Farina
      mutely, who Nodded readiness; but the instant after, a cry of anguish
      escaped from the youth:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lost! gone! lost! Where is it? where! the arrow! The Silver Arrow! My
      Margarita!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Ere the echoes of his voice had ceased lamenting into the distance, they
      found themselves alone on the wharf.

      THE LILIES OF THE VALLEY

<h3>
      ‘He opened like a bat!’ said the stranger.
    </h3>
<p>
      ‘His shadow was red!’ said Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He was off like an arrow!’ said the stranger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! pledge of my young love, how could I lose thee!’ exclaimed the youth,
      and his eyes were misted with tears.
    </p>
<p>
      Guy the Goshawk shook his brown locks gravely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Bring me a man, and I ‘ll stand up against him, whoever he be, like a
      man; but this fellow has an ill scent and foreign ways about him, that he
      has! His eye boils all down my backbone and tingles at my finger-tips.
      Jesu, save us!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Save us!’ repeated Farina, with the echo of a deadened soul.
    </p>
<p>
      They made the sign of the Cross, and purified the place with holy
      ejaculations.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I ‘ve seen him at last; grant it be for the last time! That’s my prayer,
      in the name of the Virgin and Trinity,’ said Guy. ‘And now let’s retrace
      our steps: perchance we shall hunt up that bauble of yours, but I’m not
      fit for mortal work this night longer.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Burdened by their black encounter, the two passed again behind the
      Cathedral. Farina’s hungry glances devoured each footmark of their track.
      Where the moon held no lantern for him, he went on his knees, and groped
      for his lost treasure with a miser’s eager patience of agony, drawing his
      hand slowly over the stony kerb and between the interstices of the
      thick-sown flints, like an acute-feeling worm. Despair grew heavy in his
      breast. At every turning he invoked some good new saint to aid him, and
      ran over all the propitiations his fancy could suggest and his religious
      lore inspire. By-and-by they reached the head of the street where
      Margarita dwelt. The moon was dipping down, and paler, as if touched with
      a warning of dawn. Chill sighs from the open land passed through the
      spaces of the city. On certain coloured gables and wood-crossed fronts,
      the white light lingered; but mostly the houses were veiled in dusk, and
      Gottlieb’s house was confused in the twilight with those of his
      neighbours, notwithstanding its greater stateliness and the old grandeur
      of its timbered bulk. They determined to take up their position there
      again, and paced on, Farina with his head below his shoulders, and Guy
      nostril in air, as if uneasy in his sense of smell.
    </p>
<p>
      On the window-ledge of a fair-fitted domicile stood a flower-pot, a rude
      earthen construction in the form of a river-barge, wherein grew some
      valley lilies that drooped their white bells over the sides.
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk eyed them wistfully.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must smell those blessed flowers if I wish to be saved!’ and he stamped
      resolve with his staff.
    </p>
<p>
      Moved by this exclamation, Farina gazed up at them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How like a company of maidens they look floating in the vessel of life!’ 
      he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Guy curiously inspected Farina and the flower-pot, shrugged, and with his
      comrade’s aid, mounted to a level with it, seized the prize and
      redescended.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There,’ he cried, between long luxurious sniffs, ‘that chases him out of
      the nostril sooner than aught else, the breath of a fresh lass-like
      flower! I was tormented till now by the reek of the damned rising from
      under me. This is heaven’s own incense, I think!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And Guy inhaled the flowers and spake prettily to them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They have a melancholy sweetness, friend,’ said Farina. ‘I think of
      whispering Fays, and Elf, and Erl, when their odour steals through me. Do
      not you?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nay, nor hope to till my wits are clean gone,’ was the Goshawk’s reply.
      ‘To my mind, ‘tis an honest flower, and could I do good service by the
      young maiden who there set it, I should be rendering back good service
      done; for if that flower has not battled the devil in my nose this night,
      and beaten him, my head’s a medlar!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I scarce know whether as a devout Christian I should listen to that,
      friend,’ Farina mildly remonstrated. ‘Lilies are indeed emblems of the
      saints; but then they are not poor flowers of earth, being transfigured,
      lustrous unfadingly. Oh, Cross and Passion! with what silver serenity thy
      glory enwraps me, gazing on these fair bells! I look on the white sea of
      the saints. I am enamoured of fleshly anguish and martyrdom. All beauty is
      that worn by wan-smiling faces wherein Hope sits as a crown on Sorrow, and
      the pale ebb of mortal life is the twilight of joy everlasting. Colourless
      peace! Oh, my beloved! So walkest thou for my soul on the white sea ever
      at night, clad in the straight fall of thy spotless virgin linen; bearing
      in thy hand the lily, and leaning thy cheek to it, where the human rose is
      softened to a milky bloom of red, the espousals of heaven with earth; over
      thee, moving with thee, a wreath of sapphire stars, and the solitude of
      purity around!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ sighed the Goshawk, dandling his flower-pot; ‘the moon gives strokes
      as well’s the sun. I’ faith, moon-struck and maid-struck in one! He’ll be
      asking for his head soon. This dash of the monk and the minstrel is a sure
      sign. That ‘s their way of loving in this land: they all go mad, straight
      off. I never heard such talk.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Guy accompanied these remarks with a pitiful glance at his companion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come, Sir Lover! lend me a help to give back what we’ve borrowed to its
      rightful owner. ‘S blood! but I feel an appetite. This night-air takes me
      in the wind like a battering ram. I thought I had laid in a stout
      four-and-twenty hours’ stock of Westphalian Wurst at Master Groschen’s
      supper-table. Good stuff, washed down with superior Rhine wine; say your
      Liebfrauenmilch for my taste; though, when I first tried it, I grimaced
      like a Merry-Andrew, and remembered roast beef and Glo’ster ale in my
      prayers.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk was in the act of replacing the pot of lilies, when a blow
      from a short truncheon, skilfully flung, struck him on the neck and
      brought him to the ground. With him fell the lilies. He glared to the
      right and left, and grasped the broken flower-pot for a return missile;
      but no enemy was in view to test his accuracy of aim.
    </p>
<p>
      The deep-arched doorways showed their empty recesses the windows slept.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Has that youth played me false?’ thought the discomfited squire, as he
      leaned quietly on his arm. Farina was nowhere near.
    </p>
<p>
      Guy was quickly reassured.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘By my fay, now! that’s a fine thing! and a fine fellow! and a fleet foot!
      That lad ‘ll rise! He’ll be a squire some day. Look at him. Bowels of
      a’Becket! ‘tis a sight! I’d rather see that, now, than old Groschen ‘s
      supper-table groaning with Wurst again, and running a river of
      Rudesheimer! Tussle on! I’ll lend a hand if there’s occasion; but you
      shall have the honour, boy, an you can win it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      This crying on of the hound was called forth by a chase up the street, in
      which the Goshawk beheld Farina pursue and capture a stalwart runaway, who
      refused with all his might to be brought back, striving every two and
      three of his tiptoe steps to turn against the impulse Farina had got on
      his neck and nether garments.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who ‘d have thought the lad was so wiry and mettlesome, with his soft
      face, blue eyes, and lank locks? but a green mead has more in it than many
      a black mountain. Hail, and well done! if I could dub you knight, I would:
      trust me!’ and he shook Farina by the hand.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina modestly stood aside, and allowed the Goshawk to confront his
      prisoner.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So, Sir Shy-i’the-dark! gallant Stick-i’the-back! Squire Truncheon, and
      Knight of the noble order of Quicksilver Legs! just take your stand at the
      distance you were off me when you discharged this instrument at my head.
      By ‘r lady! I smart a scratch to pay you in coin, and it’s lucky for you
      the coin is small, or you might reckon on it the same, trust me. Now,
      back!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk lunged out with the truncheon, but the prisoner displayed no
      hesitation in complying, and fell back about a space of fifteen yards.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose he guesses I’ve never done the stupid trick before,’ mused Guy,
      ‘or he would not be so sharp.’ Observing that Farina had also fallen back
      in a line as guard, Guy motioned him to edge off to the right more,
      bawling, ‘Never mind why!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now,’ thought Guy, ‘if I were sure of notching him, I’d do the speech
      part first; but as I’m not—throwing truncheons being no honourable
      profession anywhere—I’ll reserve that. The rascal don’t quail. We’ll
      see how long he stands firm.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk cleared his wrist, fixed his eye, and swung the truncheon
      meditatively to and fro by one end. He then launched off the shoulder a
      mighty down-fling, calmly, watching it strike the prisoner to earth, like
      an ox under the hammer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A hit!’ said he, and smoothed his wrist.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina knelt by the body, and lifted the head on his breast. ‘Berthold!
      Berthold!’ he cried; ‘no further harm shall hap to you, man! Speak!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You ken the scapegrace?’ said Guy, sauntering up.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘‘Tis Berthold Schmidt, son of old Schmidt, the great goldsmith of
      Cologne.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘St. Dunstan was not at his elbow this time!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A rival of mine,’ whispered Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oho!’ and the Goshawk wound a low hiss at his tongue’s tip. ‘Well! as I
      should have spoken if his ears had been open: Justice struck the blow; and
      a gentle one. This comes of taking a flying shot, and not standing up
      fair. And that seems all that can be said. Where lives he?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina pointed to the house of the Lilies.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beshrew me! the dog has some right on his side. Whew! yonder he lives? He
      took us for some night-prowlers. Why not come up fairly, and ask my
      business?
    </p>
<p>
      Smelling a flower is not worth a broken neck, nor defending your premises
      quite deserving a hole in the pate. Now, my lad, you see what comes of
      dealing with cut and run blows; and let this be a warning to you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      They took the body by head and feet, and laid him at the door of his
      father’s house. Here the colour came to his cheek, and they wiped off the
      streaks of blood that stained him. Guy proved he could be tender with a
      fallen foe, and Farina with an ill-fated rival. It was who could suggest
      the soundest remedies, or easiest postures. One lent a kerchief and nursed
      him; another ran to the city fountain and fetched him water. Meantime the
      moon had dropped, and morning, grey and beamless, looked on the
      house-peaks and along the streets with steadier eye. They now both
      discerned a body of men, far down, fronting Gottlieb’s house, and drawn up
      in some degree of order. All their charity forsook them at once.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Possess thyself of the truncheon,’ said Guy: ‘You see it can damage. More
      work before breakfast, and a fine account I must give of myself to my
      hostess of the Three Holy Kings!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina recovered the destructive little instrument.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am ready,’ said he. ‘But hark! there’s little work for us there, I
      fancy. Those be lads of Cologne, no grunters of the wild. ‘Tis the White
      Rose Club. Always too late for service.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Voices singing a hunting glee, popular in that age, swelled up the clear
      morning air; and gradually the words became distinct.
    </p>
<pre>
             The Kaiser went a-hunting,
               A-hunting, tra-ra:
          With his bugle-horn at springing morn,
          The Kaiser trampled bud and thorn:
                    Tra-ra!

        And the dew shakes green as the horsemen rear,
        And a thousand feathers they flutter with fear;
        And a pang drives quick to the heart of the deer;
          For the Kaiser’s out a-hunting,
                  Tra-ra!
             Ta, ta, ta, ta,
             Tra-ra, tra-ra,
             Ta-ta, tra-ra, tra-ra!
</pre>
<p>
      the owner of the truncheon awoke to these reviving tones, and uttered a
      faint responsive ‘Tra-ra!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hark again!’ said Farina, in reply to the commendation of the Goshawk,
      whose face was dimpled over with the harmony.
    </p>
<pre>
          The wild boar lay a-grunting,
             A-grunting, tra-ra!
        And, boom! comes the Kaiser to hunt up me?
        Or, queak! the small birdie that hops on the tree?
                  Tra-ra!
        O birdie, and boar, and deer, lie tame!
        For a maiden in bloom, or a full-blown dame,
        Are the daintiest prey, and the windingest game,
          When Kaisers go a-hunting,
                  Tra-ra!
             Ha, ha, ha, ha,
               Tra-ra, tra-ra,
             Ha-ha, tra-ra, tra-ra!
</pre>
<p>
      The voices held long on the last note, and let it die in a forest cadence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘‘Fore Gad! well done. Hurrah! Tra-ra, ha-ha, tra-ra! That’s a trick we’re
      not half alive to at home,’ said Guy. ‘I feel friendly with these German
      lads.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk’s disposition toward German lads was that moment harshly
      tested by a smart rap on the shoulder from an end of German oak, and a
      proclamation that he was prisoner of the hand that gave the greeting, in
      the name of the White Rose Club. Following that, his staff was wrested
      from him by a dozen stout young fellows, who gave him no time to get his
      famous distance for defence against numbers; and he and Farina were
      marched forthwith to the chorusing body in front of Gottlieb Groschen’s
      house.

<h2>
      THE MISSIVES
    </h2>
<p>
      Of all the inmates, Gottlieb had slept most with the day on his eyelids,
      for Werner hung like a nightmare over him. Margarita lay and dreamed in
      rose-colour, and if she thrilled on her pillowed silken couch like a
      tense-strung harp, and fretted drowsily in little leaps and starts, it was
      that a bird lay in her bosom, panting and singing through the night, and
      that he was not to be stilled, but would musically utter the sweetest
      secret thoughts of a love-bewitched maiden. Farina’s devotion she knew his
      tenderness she divined: his courage she had that day witnessed. The young
      girl no sooner felt that she could love worthily, than she loved with her
      whole strength. Muffed and remote came the hunting-song under her pillow,
      and awoke dreamy delicate curves in her fair face, as it thinned but did
      not banish her dream. Aunt Lisbeth also heard the song, and burst out of
      her bed to see that the door and window were secured against the wanton
      Kaiser. Despite her trials, she had taken her spell of sleep; but being
      possessed of some mystic maiden belief that in cases of apprehended peril
      from man, bed was a rock of refuge and fortified defence, she crept back
      there, and allowed the sun to rise without her. Gottlieb’s voice could not
      awaken her to the household duties she loved to perform with such a
      doleful visage. She heard him open his window, and parley in angry tones
      with the musicians below.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Decoys!’ muttered Aunt Lisbeth; ‘be thou alive to them, Gottlieb!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He went downstairs and opened the street door, whereupon the scolding and
      railing commenced anew.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thou hast given them vantage, Gottlieb, brother mine,’ she complained;
      ‘and the good heavens only can say what may result from such
      indiscreetness.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A silence, combustible with shuffling of feet in the passage and on the
      stairs, dinned horrors into Aunt Lisbeth’s head.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It was just that sound in the left wing of Hollenbogenblitz,’ she said:
      ‘only then it was night and not morning. Ursula preserve me!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, Lisbeth! Lisbeth!’ cried Gottlieb from below. ‘Come down! ‘tis full
      five o’ the morning. Here’s company; and what are we to do without the
      woman?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah, Gottlieb! that is like men! They do not consider how different it is
      for us!’ which mysterious sentence being uttered to herself alone, enjoyed
      a meaning it would elsewhere have been denied.
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth dressed, and met Margarita descending. They exchanged the
      good-morning of young maiden and old.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Go thou first,’ said Aunt Lisbeth.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita gaily tripped ahead.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Girl!’ cried Aunt Lisbeth, ‘what’s that thing in thy back hair?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have borrowed Lieschen’s arrow, aunt. Mine has had an accident.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lieschen’s arrow! An accident! Now I will see to that after breakfast,
      Margarita.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tra-ra, ta-ta, tra-ra, tra-ra,’ sang Margarita.
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘The wild boar lay a-grunting,
             A-grunting, tra-ra.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      ‘A maiden’s true and proper ornament! Look at mine, child! I have worn it
      fifty years. May I deserve to wear it till I am called! O Margarita!
      trifle not with that symbol.’ 
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘“O birdie, and boar, and deer, lie tame!”
 </pre>
<p>
      I am so happy, aunty.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nice times to be happy in, Margarita.’ 
    </p>
<pre>
       “Be happy in Spring, sweet maidens all,
        For Autumn’s chill will early fall.”
 </pre>
<p>
      So sings the Minnesinger, aunty; and
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘“A maiden in the wintry leaf
        Will spread her own disease of grief.”
 </pre>
<p>
      I love the Minnesingers! Dear, sweet-mannered men they are! Such lovers!
      And men of deeds as well as song: sword on one side and harp on the other.
      They fight till set of sun, and then slacken their armour to waft a ballad
      to their beloved by moonlight, covered with stains of battle as they are,
      and weary!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What a girl! Minnesingers! Yes; I know stories of those Minnesingers.
      They came to the castle—Margarita, a bead of thy cross is broken. I
      will attend to it. Wear the pearl one till I mend this. May’st thou never
      fall in the way of Minnesingers. They are not like Werner’s troop. They do
      not batter at doors: they slide into the house like snakes.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lisbeth! Lisbeth!’ they heard Gottlieb calling impatiently.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We come, Gottlieb!’ and in a low murmur Margarita heard her say: ‘May
      this day pass without trouble and shame to the pious and the chaste.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita knew the voice of the stranger before she had opened the door,
      and on presenting herself, the hero gave her a guardian-like salute.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One may see,’ he said, ‘that it requires better men than those of Werner
      to drive away the rose from that cheek.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Gottlieb pressed the rosy cheek to his shoulder and patted her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you think, Grete? You have now forty of the best lads in Cologne
      enrolled to protect you, and keep guard over the house night and day.
      There! What more could a Pfalzgrafin ask, now? And voluntary service; all
      to be paid with a smile, which I daresay my lady won’t refuse them.
      Lisbeth, you know our friend. Fear him not, good Lisbeth, and give us
      breakfast. Well, sweet chuck, you’re to have royal honours paid you. I
      warrant they’ve begun good work already in locking up that idle moony
      vagabond, Farina—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Him? What for, my father? How dared they! What has he done?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘O, start not, my fairy maid! A small matter of breakage, pet! He tried to
      enter Cunigonde Schmidt’s chamber, and knocked down her pot of lilies: for
      which Berthold Schmidt knocked him down, and our friend here, out of good
      fellowship, knocked down Berthold. However, the chief offender is marched
      off to prison by your trusty guard, and there let him cool himself.
      Berthold shall tell you the tale himself: he’ll be here to breakfast, and
      receive your orders, mistress commander-in-chief.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk had his eye on Margarita. Her teeth were tight down on her
      nether lip, and her whole figure had a strange look of awkwardness, she
      was so divided with anger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As witness of the affair, I think I shall make a clearer statement, fair
      maiden,’ he interposed. ‘In the first place, I am the offender. We passed
      under the window of the Fraulein Schmidt, and ‘twas I mounted to greet the
      lilies. One shoot of them is in my helm, and here let me present them to a
      worthier holder.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He offered the flowers with a smile, and Margarita took them, radiant with
      gratitude.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Our friend Berthold,’ he continued, ‘thought proper to aim a blow at me
      behind my back, and then ran for his comrades. He was caught, and by my
      gallant young hero, Farina; concerning whose character I regret that your
      respected father and I differ: for, on the faith of a soldier and true
      man, he’s the finest among the fine fellows I’ve yet met in Germany, trust
      me. So, to cut the story short, execution was done upon Berthold by my
      hand, for an act of treachery. He appears to be a sort of captain of one
      of the troops, and not affectionately disposed to Farina; for the version
      of the affair you have heard from your father is a little invention of
      Master Berthold’s own. To do him justice, he seemed equally willing to get
      me under the cold stone; but a word from your good father changed the
      current; and as I thought I could serve our friend better free than behind
      bars, I accepted liberty. Pshaw! I should have accepted it any way, to
      tell the truth, for your German dungeons are mortal shivering ratty
      places. So rank me no hero, fair Mistress Margarita, though the temptation
      to seem one in such sweet eyes was beginning to lead me astray. And now,
      as to our business in the streets at this hour, believe the best of us.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will! I do!’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lisbeth! Lisbeth!’ called Gottlieb. ‘Breakfast, little sister! our
      champion is starving. He asks for wurst, milk-loaves, wine, and all thy
      rarest conserves. Haste, then, for the honour of Cologne is at stake.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth jingled her keys in and out, and soon that harmony drew a
      number of domestics with platters of swine flesh, rolls of white wheaten
      bread, the perpetual worst, milk, wine, barley-bread, and household stores
      of dainties in profusion, all sparkling on silver, relieved by spotless
      white cloth. Gottlieb beheld such a sunny twinkle across the Goshawk’s
      face at this hospitable array, that he gave the word of onset without
      waiting for Berthold, and his guest immediately fell to, and did not relax
      in his exertions for a full half-hour by the Cathedral clock, eschewing
      the beer with a wry look made up of scorn and ruefulness, and drinking a
      well-brimmed health in Rhine wine all round. Margarita was pensive: Aunt
      Lisbeth on her guard. Gottlieb remembered Charles the Great’s counsel to
      Archbishop Turpin, and did his best to remain on earth one of its lords
      dominant.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poor Berthold!’ said he. ‘‘Tis a good lad, and deserves his seat at my
      table oftener. I suppose the flower-pot business has detained him. We’ll
      drink to him: eh, Grete?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Drink to him, dear father!—but here he is to thank you in person.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita felt a twinge of pity as Berthold entered. The livid stains of
      his bruise deepened about his eyes, and gave them a wicked light whenever
      they were fixed intently; but they looked earnest; and spoke of a combat
      in which he could say that he proved no coward and was used with some
      cruelty. She turned on the Goshawk a mute reproach; yet smiled and loved
      him well when she beheld him stretch a hand of welcome and proffer a
      brotherly glass to Berthold. The rich goldsmith’s son was occupied in
      studying the horoscope of his fortunes in Margarita’s eyes; but when
      Margarita directed his attention to Guy, he turned to him with a glance of
      astonishment that yielded to cordial greeting.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well done, Berthold, my brave boy! All are friends who sit at table,’ 
      said Gottlieb. ‘In any case, at my table:
    </p>
<pre>
          “‘Tis a worthy foe
          Forgives the blow
          Was dealt him full and fairly,”
 </pre>
<p>
      says the song; and the proverb takes it up with, “A generous enemy is a
      friend on the wrong side”; and no one’s to blame for that, save old Dame
      Fortune. So now a bumper to this jovial make-up between you. Lisbeth! you
      must drink it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The little woman bowed melancholy obedience.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you fling and run?’ whispered Guy to Berthold.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because you were two against one.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Two against one, man! Why, have you no such thing as fair play in this
      land of yours? Did you think I should have taken advantage of that?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How could I tell who you were, or what you would do?’ muttered Berthold,
      somewhat sullenly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Truly no, friend! So you ran to make yourself twenty to two? But don’t be
      down on the subject. I was going to say, that though I treated you in a
      manner upright, ‘twas perhaps a trifle severe, considering your youth: but
      an example’s everything; and I must let you know in confidence, that no
      rascal truncheon had I flung in my life before; so, you see, I gave you
      all the chances.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Berthold moved his lips in reply; but thinking of the figure of defeat he
      was exhibiting before Margarita, caused him to estimate unfavourably what
      chances had stood in his favour.
    </p>
<p>
      The health was drunk. Aunt Lisbeth touched the smoky yellow glass with a
      mincing lip, and beckoned Margarita to withdraw.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The tapestry, child!’ she said. ‘Dangerous things are uttered after the
      third glass, I know, Margarita.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you call my champion handsome, aunt?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I was going to speak to you about him, Margarita. If I remember, he has
      rough, good looks, as far as they go. Yes: but thou, maiden, art thou
      thinking of him? I have thrice watched him wink; and that, as we know, is
      a habit of them that have sold themselves. And what is frail womankind to
      expect from such a brawny animal?’ 
    </p>
<pre>
          ‘And oh! to lace his armour up,
          And speed him to the field;
          To pledge him in a kissing-cup,
          The knight that will not yield!
</pre>
<p>
      I am sure he is tender, aunt. Notice how gentle he looks now and then.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thou girl! Yes, I believe she is madly in love with him. Tender, and
      gentle! So is the bear when you’re outside his den; but enter it, maiden,
      and try! Thou good Ursula, preserve me from such a fate.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Fear not, dear aunt! Have not a fear of it! Besides, it is not always the
      men that are bad. You must not forget Dalilah, and Lot’s wife, and
      Pfalzgrafin Jutta, and the Baroness who asked for a piece of poor Kraut.
      But, let us work, let us work!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita sat down before Siegfried, and contemplated the hero. For the
      first time, she marked a resemblance in his features to Farina: the same
      long yellow hair scattered over his shoulders as that flowing from under
      Siegfried’s helm; the blue eyes, square brows, and regular outlines. ‘This
      is a marvel,’ thought Margarita. ‘And Farina! it was to watch over me that
      he roamed the street last night, my best one! Is he not beautiful?’ and
      she looked closer at Siegfried.
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth had begun upon the dragon with her usual method, and was soon
      wandering through skeleton halls of the old palatial castle in Bohemia.
      The woolly tongue of the monster suggested fresh horrors to her, and if
      Margarita had listened, she might have had fair excuses to forget her
      lover’s condition; but her voice only did service like a piece of
      clock-work, and her mind was in the prison with Farina. She was long
      debating how to win his release; and meditated so deeply, and exclaimed in
      so many bursts of impatience, that Aunt Lisbeth found her heart melting to
      the maiden. ‘Now,’ said she, ‘that is a well-known story about the
      Electress Dowager of Bavaria, when she came on a visit to the castle; and,
      my dear child, be it a warning. Terrible, too!’ and the little woman
      shivered pleasantly. ‘She had—I may tell you this, Margarita—yes,
      she had been false to her wedded husband.—You understand, maiden;
      or, no! you do not understand: I understand it only partly, mind. False, I
      say——’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘False—not true: go on, dear aunty,’ said Margarita, catching the
      word.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I believe she knows as much as I do!’ ejaculated Aunt Lisbeth; ‘such are
      girls nowadays. When I was young-oh! for a maiden to know anything then—oh!
      it was general reprobation. No one thought of confessing it. We blushed
      and held down our eyes at the very idea. Well, the Electress! she was—you
      must guess. So she called for her caudle at eleven o’clock at night. What
      do you think that was? Well, there was spirit in it: not to say nutmeg,
      and lemon, and peach kernels. She wanted me to sit with her, but I begged
      my mistress to keep me from the naughty woman: and no friend of Hilda of
      Bayern was Bertha of Bohmen, you may be sure. Oh! the things she talked
      while she was drinking her caudle.
    </p>
<p>
      Isentrude sat with her, and said it was fearful!—beyond blasphemy!
      and that she looked like a Bible witch, sitting up drinking and swearing
      and glaring in her nightclothes and nightcap. She was on a journey into
      Hungary, and claimed the hospitality of the castle on her way there. Both
      were widows. Well, it was a quarter to twelve. The Electress dropped back
      on her pillow, as she always did when she had finished the candle.
      Isentrude covered her over, heaped up logs on the fire, wrapped her
      dressing-gown about her, and prepared to sleep. It was Winter, and the
      wind howled at the doors, and rattled the windows, and shook the arras—Lord
      help us! Outside was all snow, and nothing but forest; as you saw when you
      came to me there, Gretelchen. Twelve struck. Isentrude was dozing; but she
      says that after the last stroke she woke with cold. A foggy chill hung in
      the room. She looked at the Electress, who had not moved. The fire burned
      feebly, and seemed weighed upon: Herr Je!—she thought she heard a
      noise. No. Quite quiet! As heaven preserve her, says slip, the smell in
      that room grew like an open grave, clammily putrid. Holy Virgin! This time
      she was certain she heard a noise; but it seemed on both sides of her.
      There was the great door leading to the first landing and state-room; and
      opposite exactly there was the panel of the secret passage. The noises
      seemed to advance as if step by step, and grew louder in each ear as she
      stood horrified on the marble of the hearth. She looked at the Electress
      again, and her eyes were wide open; but for all Isentrude’s calling, she
      would not wake. Only think! Now the noise increased, and was a regular
      tramp-grate, tramp-screw sound-coming nearer and nearer: Saints of mercy!
      The apartment was choking with vapours. Isentrude made a dart, and robed
      herself behind a curtain of the bed just as the two doors opened. She
      could see through a slit in the woven work, and winked her eyes which she
      had shut close on hearing the scream of the door-hinges—winked her
      eyes to catch a sight for moment—we are such sinful, curious
      creatures!—What she saw then, she says she shall never forget; nor
      I! As she was a living woman, there she saw the two dead princes, the
      Prince Palatine of Bohemia and the Elector of Bavaria, standing front to
      front at the foot of the bed, all in white armour, with drawn swords, and
      attendants holding pine-torches. Neither of them spoke. Their vizors were
      down; but she knew them by their arms and bearing: both tall, stately
      presences, good knights in their day, and had fought against the Infidel!
      So one of them pointed to the bed, and then a torch was lowered, and the
      fight commenced. Isentrude saw the sparks fly, and the steel struck till
      it was shattered; but they fought on, not caring for wounds, and snorting
      with fury as they grew hotter. They fought a whole hour. The poor girl was
      so eaten up with looking on, that she let go the curtain and stood quite
      exposed among them. So, to steady herself, she rested her hand on the
      bed-side; and—think what she felt—a hand as cold as ice locked
      hers, and get from it she could not! That instant one of the princes fell.
      It was Bohmen. Bayern sheathed his sword, and waved his hand, and the
      attendants took up the slaughtered ghost, feet and shoulders, and bore him
      to the door of the secret passage, while Bayern strode after—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Shameful!’ exclaimed Margarita. ‘I will speak to Berthold as he descends.
      I hear him coming. He shall do what I wish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Call it dreadful, Grete! Dreadful it was. If Berthold would like to sit
      and hear—Ah! she is gone. A good girl! and of a levity only on the
      surface.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth heard Margarita’s voice rapidly addressing Berthold. His
      reply was low and brief. ‘Refuses to listen to anything of the sort,’ Aunt
      Lisbeth interpreted it. Then he seemed to be pleading, and Margarita
      uttering short answers. ‘I trust ‘tis nothing a maiden should not hear,’ 
      the little lady exclaimed with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
      The door opened, and Lieschen stood at the entrance.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For Fraulein Margarita,’ she said, holding a letter halfway out.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Give it,’ Aunt Lisbeth commanded.
    </p>
<p>
      The woman hesitated—‘‘Tis for the Fraulein.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Give it, I tell thee!’ and Aunt Lisbeth eagerly seized the missive, and
      subjected it to the ordeal of touch. It was heavy, and contained something
      hard. Long pensive pressures revealed its shape on the paper. It was an
      arrow. ‘Go!’ said she to the woman, and, once alone, began, bee-like, to
      buzz all over it, and finally entered. It contained Margarita’s Silver
      Arrow. ‘The art of that girl!’ And the writing said:
    </p>
<pre>
   ‘SWEETEST MAIDEN!

   ‘By this arrow of our betrothal, I conjure thee to meet me in all
   haste without the western gate, where, burning to reveal to thee
   most urgent tidings that may not be confided to paper, now waits,
   petitioning the saints, thy

                    ‘FARINA.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      Aunt Lisbeth placed letter and arrow in a drawer; locked it; and ‘always
      thought so.’ She ascended the stairs to consult with Gottlieb. Roars of
      laughter greeted her just as she lifted the latch, and she retreated
      abashed.
    </p>
<p>
      There was no time to lose. Farina must be caught in the act of waiting for
      Margarita, and by Gottlieb, or herself. Gottlieb was revelling. ‘May this
      be a warning to thee, Gottlieb,’ murmured Lisbeth, as she hooded her
      little body in Margarita’s fur-cloak, and determined that she would be the
      one to confound Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      Five minutes later Margarita returned. Aunt Lisbeth was gone. The dragon
      still lacked a tip to his forked tongue, and a stream of fiery threads
      dangled from the jaws of the monster. Another letter was brought into the
      room by Lieschen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For Aunt Lisbeth,’ said Margarita, reading the address. ‘Who can it be
      from?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She does not stand pressing about your letters,’ said the woman; and
      informed Margarita of the foregoing missive.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You say she drew an arrow from it?’ said Margarita, with burning face.
      ‘Who brought this? tell me!’ and just waiting to hear it was Farina’s
      mother, she tore the letter open, and read:
    </p>
<pre>
   ‘DEAREST LISBETH!

   ‘Thy old friend writes to thee; she that has scarce left eyes to see
   the words she writes. Thou knowest we are a fallen house, through
   the displeasure of the Emperor on my dead husband. My son, Farina,
   is my only stay, and well returns to me the blessings I bestow upon
   him. Some call him idle: some think him too wise. I swear to thee,
   Lisbeth, he is only good. His hours are devoted to the extraction
   of essences—to no black magic. Now he is in trouble-in prison.
   The shadow that destroyed his dead father threatens him. Now, by
   our old friendship, beloved Lisbeth! intercede with Gottlieb, that
   he may plead for my son before the Emperor when he comes—’ 
</pre>
<p>
      Margarita read no more. She went to the window, and saw her guard
      marshalled outside. She threw a kerchief over her head, and left the house
      by the garden gate.

<h2>
      THE MONK
    </h2>
<p>
      By this time the sun stood high over Cologne. The market-places were
      crowded with buyers and sellers, mixed with a loitering swarm of soldiery,
      for whose thirsty natures winestalls had been tumbled up. Barons and
      knights of the empire, bravely mounted and thickly followed, poured hourly
      into Cologne from South Germany and North. Here, staring Suabians, and
      round-featured warriors of the East Kingdom, swaggered up and down,
      patting what horses came across them, for lack of occupation for their
      hands. Yonder, huge Pomeranians, with bosks of beard stiffened out square
      from the chin, hurtled mountainous among the peaceable inhabitants.
      Troopers dismounted went straddling, in tight hose and loose, prepared to
      drink good-will to whomsoever would furnish the best quality liquor for
      that solemn pledge, and equally ready to pick a quarrel with them that
      would not. It was a scene of flaring feathers, wide-flapped bonnets,
      flaunting hose, blue and battered steel plates, slashed woollen
      haunch-bags, leather-leggings, ensigns, and imperious boots and shoulders.
      Margarita was too hurried in her mind to be conscious of an imprudence;
      but her limbs trembled, and she instinctively quickened her steps. When
      she stood under the sign of the Three Holy Kings, where dwelt Farina’s
      mother, she put up a fervent prayer of thanks, and breathed freely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had expected a message from Lisbeth,’ said Frau Farina; ‘but thou, good
      heart! thou wilt help us?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘All that may be done by me I will do,’ replied Margarita; ‘but his mother
      yearns to see him, and I have come to bear her company.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The old lady clasped her hands and wept.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Has he found so good a friend, my poor boy! And trust me, dear maiden, he
      is not unworthy, for better son never lived, and good son, good all!
      Surely we will go to him, but not as thou art. I will dress thee. Such
      throngs are in the streets: I heard them clattering in early this morning.
      Rest, dear heart, till I return.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita had time to inspect the single sitting-room in which her lover
      lived. It was planted with bottles, and vases, and pipes, and cylinders,
      piling on floor, chair, and table. She could not suppress a slight
      surprise of fear, for this display showed a dealing with hidden things,
      and a summoning of scattered spirits. It was this that made his brow so
      pale, and the round of his eye darker than youth should let it be! She
      dismissed the feeling, and assumed her own bright face as Dame Farina
      reappeared, bearing on her arm a convent garb, and other apparel.
      Margarita suffered herself to be invested in the white and black robes of
      the denial of life.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There!’ said the Frau Farina, ‘and to seal assurance, I have engaged a
      guard to accompany us. He was sorely bruised in a street combat yesterday,
      and was billeted below, where I nursed and tended him, and he is grateful,
      as man should be-though I did little, doing my utmost—and with him
      near us we have nought to fear.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good,’ said Margarita, and they kissed and departed. The guard was
      awaiting them outside.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come, my little lady, and with thee the holy sister! ‘Tis no step from
      here, and I gage to bring ye safe, as sure as my name’s Schwartz Thier!—Hey?
      The good sister’s dropping. Look, now! I’ll carry her.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita recovered her self-command before he could make good this offer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only let us hasten there,’ she gasped.
    </p>
<p>
      The Thier strode on, and gave them safe-conduct to the prison where Farina
      was confined, being near one of the outer forts of the city.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thank and dismiss him,’ whispered Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nay! he will wait-wilt thou not, friend! We shall not be long, though it
      is my son I visit here,’ said Frau Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Till to-morrow morning, my little lady! The lion thanked him that plucked
      the thorn from his foot, and the Thier may be black, but he’s not
      ungrateful, nor a worse beast than the lion.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      They entered the walls and left him.
    </p>
<p>
      For the first five minutes Schwartz Thier found employment for his
      faculties by staring at the shaky, small-paned windows of the
      neighbourhood. He persevered in this, after all novelty had been
      exhausted, from an intuitive dread of weariness. There was nothing to see.
      An old woman once bobbed out of an attic, and doused the flints with
      water. Harassed by increasing dread of the foul nightmare of
      nothing-to-do, the Thier endeavoured to establish amorous intelligence
      with her. She responded with an indignant projection of the underjaw,
      evanishing rapidly. There was no resource left him but to curse her with
      extreme heartiness. The Thier stamped his right leg, and then his left,
      and remembered the old woman as a grievance five minutes longer. When she
      was clean forgotten, he yawned. Another spouse of the moment was wanted,
      to be wooed, objurgated, and regretted. The prison-gate was in a secluded
      street. Few passengers went by, and those who did edged away from the
      ponderous, wanton-eyed figure of lazy mischief lounging there, as neatly
      as they well could. The Thier hailed two or three. One took to his legs,
      another bowed, smirked, gave him a kindly good-day, and affected to hear
      no more, having urgent business in prospect. The Thier was a faithful dog,
      but the temptation to betray his trust and pursue them was mighty. He
      began to experience an equal disposition to cry and roar. He hummed a
      ballad—
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘I swore of her I’d have my will,
         And with him I’d have my way:
        I learn’d my cross-bow over the hill:
         Now what does my lady say?
</pre>
<p>
      Give me the good old cross-bow, after all, and none of these lumbering
      puff-and-bangs that knock you down oftener than your man!
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘A cross stands in the forest still,
         And a cross in the churchyard grey:
        My curse on him who had his will,
         And on him who had his way!
</pre>
<p>
      Good beginning, bad ending! ‘Tisn’t so always. “Many a cross has the
      cross-bow built,” they say. I wish I had mine, now, to peg off that old
      woman, or somebody. I’d swear she’s peeping at me over the gable, or
      behind some cranny. They’re curious, the old women, curse ‘em! And the
      young, for that matter. Devil a young one here.
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘When I’m in for the sack of a town,
         What, think ye, I poke after, up and down?
        Silver and gold I pocket in plenty,
         But the sweet tit-bit is my lass under twenty.
</pre>
<p>
      I should like to be in for the sack of this Cologne. I’d nose out that
      pretty girl I was cheated of yesterday. Take the gold and silver, and give
      me the maiden! Her neck’s silver, and her hair gold. Ah! and her cheeks
      roses, and her mouth-say no more! I’m half thinking Werner, the hungry
      animal, has cast wolf’s eyes on her. They say he spoke of her last night.
      Don’t let him thwart me. Thunderblast him! I owe him a grudge. He’s
      beginning to forget my plan o’ life.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A flight of pigeons across the blue top of the street abstracted the Thier
      from these reflections. He gaped after them in despair, and fell to
      stretching and shaking himself, rattling his lungs with loud reports. As
      he threw his eyes round again, they encountered those of a monk opposite
      fastened on him in penetrating silence. The Thier hated monks as a wild
      beast shuns fire; but now even a monk was welcome.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Halloo!’ he sung out.
    </p>
<p>
      The monk crossed over to him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Friend!’ said he, ‘weariness is teaching thee wantonness. Wilt thou take
      service for a night’s work, where the danger is little, the reward
      lasting?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As for that,’ replied the Thier, ‘danger comes to me like greenwood to
      the deer, and good pay never yet was given in promises. But I’m bound for
      the next hour to womankind within there. They’re my masters; as they’ve
      been of tough fellows before me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will seek them, and win their consent,’ said the monk, and so left him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Quick dealing!’ thought the Thier, and grew brisker. ‘The Baron won’t
      want me to-night: and what if he does? Let him hang himself—though,
      if he should, ‘twill be a pity I’m not by to help him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He paced under the wall to its farthest course. Turning back, he perceived
      the monk at the gateway.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A sharp hand!’ thought the Thier.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Intrude no question on me,’ the monk began; ‘but hold thy peace and
      follow: the women release thee, and gladly.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s not my plan o’ life, now! Money down, and then command me’: and
      Schwartz Thier stood with one foot forward, and hand stretched out.
    </p>
<p>
      A curl of scorn darkened the cold features of the monk.
    </p>
<p>
      He slid one hand into a side of his frock above the girdle, and tossed a
      bag of coin.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Take it, if ‘tis in thee to forfeit the greater blessing,’ he cried
      contemptuously.
    </p>
<p>
      The Thier peeped into the bag, and appeared satisfied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I follow,’ said he; ‘lead on, good father, and I’ll be in the track of
      holiness for the first time since my mother was quit of me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The monk hurried up the street and into the marketplace, oblivious of the
      postures and reverences of the people, who stopped to stare at him and his
      gaunt attendant. As they crossed the square, Schwartz Thier spied Henker
      Rothhals starting from a wine-stall on horseback, and could not forbear
      hailing him. Before the monk had time to utter a reproach, they were deep
      together in a double-shot of query and reply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Whirr!’ cried the Thier, breaking on some communication. ‘Got her, have
      they? and swung her across stream? I’m one with ye for my share, or call
      me sheep!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He waved his hand to the monk, and taking hold of the horse’s rein, ran
      off beside his mounted confederate, heavily shod as he was.
    </p>
<p>
      The monk frowned after him, and swelled with a hard sigh.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gone!’ he exclaimed, ‘and the accursed gold with him! Well did a voice
      warn me that such service was never to be bought!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He did not pause to bewail or repent, but returned toward the prison with
      rapid footsteps, muttering: ‘I with the prison-pass for two; why was I
      beguiled by that bandit? Saw I not the very youth given into my hands
      there, he that was with the damsel and the aged woman?’

<h2>
      THE RIDE AND THE RACE
    </h2>
<p>
      Late in the noon a horseman, in the livery of the Kaiser’s body-guard,
      rode dry and dusty into Cologne, with tidings that the Kaiser was at
      Hammerstein Castle, and commanding all convocated knights, barons, counts,
      and princes, to assemble and prepare for his coming, on a certain bare
      space of ground within two leagues of Cologne, thence to swell the train
      of his triumphal entry into the ancient city of his empire.
    </p>
<p>
      Guy the Goshawk, broad-set on a Flemish mare, and a pack-horse beside him,
      shortly afterward left the hotel of the Three Holy Kings, and trotted up
      to Gottlieb’s door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tent-pitching is now my trade,’ said he, as Gottlieb came down to him.
      ‘My lord is with the Kaiser. I must say farewell for the nonce. Is the
      young lady visible?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nor young, nor old, good friend,’ replied Gottlieb, with a countenance
      somewhat ruffled. ‘I dined alone for lack of your company. Secret missives
      came, I hear, to each of them, and both are gadding. Now what think you of
      this, after the scene of yesterday?—Lisbeth too!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Preaches from the old text, Master Groschen; “Never reckon on womankind
      for a wise act.” But farewell! and tell Mistress Margarita that I take it
      ill of her not giving me her maiden hand to salute before parting. My
      gravest respects to Frau Lisbeth. I shall soon be sitting with you over
      that prime vintage of yours, or fortune’s dead against me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      So, with a wring of the hand, Guy put the spur to his round-flanked beast,
      and was quickly out of Cologne on the rough roadway.
    </p>
<p>
      He was neither the first nor the last of the men-at-arms hastening to obey
      the Kaiser’s mandate. A string of horse and foot in serpentine knots
      stretched along the flat land, flashing colours livelier than the
      spring-meadows bordering their line of passage. Guy, with a nod for all,
      and a greeting for the best-disposed, pushed on toward the van, till the
      gathering block compelled him to adopt the snail’s pace of the advance
      party, and gave him work enough to keep his two horses from being jammed
      with the mass. Now and then he cast a weather-eye on the heavens, and was
      soon confirmed in an opinion he had repeatedly ejaculated, that ‘the first
      night’s camping would be a drencher.’ In the West a black bank of cloud
      was blotting out the sun before his time. Northeast shone bare fields of
      blue lightly touched with loosefloating strips and flakes of crimson
      vapour. The furrows were growing purple-dark, and gradually a low moaning
      obscurity enwrapped the whole line, and mufed the noise of hoof, oath, and
      waggon-wheel in one sullen murmur.
    </p>
<p>
      Guy felt very much like a chopped worm, as he wriggled his way onward in
      the dusk, impelled from the rear, and reduced to grope after the main
      body. Frequent and deep counsel he took with a trusty flask suspended at
      his belt. It was no pleasant reflection that the rain would be down before
      he could build up anything like shelter for horse and man. Still sadder
      the necessity of selecting his post on strange ground, and in darkness. He
      kept an anxious look-out for the moon, and was presently rejoiced to
      behold a broad fire that twinkled branchy beams through an east-hill
      orchard.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My lord calls her Goddess,’ said Guy, wistfully. ‘The title’s outlandish,
      and more the style of these foreigners but she may have it to-night, an
      she ‘ll just keep the storm from shrouding her bright eye a matter of two
      hours.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She rose with a boding lustre. Drifts of thin pale upper-cloud leaned down
      ladders, pure as virgin silver, for her to climb to her highest seat on
      the unrebellious half-circle of heaven.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My mind’s made up!’ quoth Guy to the listening part of himself. ‘Out of
      this I’ll get.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      By the clearer ray he had discerned a narrow track running a white
      parallel with the general route. At the expense of dislocating a mile of
      the cavalcade, he struck into it. A dyke had to be taken, some heavy
      fallows crossed, and the way was straight before him. He began to sneer at
      the slow jog-trot and absence of enterprise which made the fellows he had
      left shine so poorly in comparison with the Goshawk, but a sight of two
      cavaliers in advance checked his vanity, and now to overtake them he
      tasked his fat Flemish mare with unwonted pricks of the heel, that made
      her fling out and show more mettle than speed.
    </p>
<p>
      The objects of this fiery chase did not at first awake to a sense of being
      pursued. Both rode with mantled visages, and appeared profoundly
      inattentive to the world outside their meditations. But the Goshawk was
      not to be denied, and by dint of alternately roaring at them and
      upbraiding his two stumping beasts, he at last roused the younger of the
      cavaliers, who called to his companion loudly: without effect it seemed,
      for he had to repeat the warning. Guy was close up with them, when the
      youth exclaimed:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father! holy father! ‘Tis Sathanas in person!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The other rose and pointed trembling to a dark point in the distance as he
      vociferated:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not here! not here; but yonder!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Guy recognized the voice of the first speaker, and cried:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Stay! halt a second! Have you forgotten the Goshawk?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never!’ came the reply, ‘and forget not Farina!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Spur and fleeter steeds carried them out of hearing ere Guy could throw in
      another syllable. Farina gazed back on him remorsefully, but the Monk now
      rated his assistant with indignation.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thou weak one! nothing less than fool! to betray thy name on such an
      adventure as this to soul save the saints!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina tossed back his locks, and held his forehead to the moon. All the
      Monk’s ghostly wrath was foiled by the one little last sweet word of his
      beloved, which made music in his ears whenever annoyance sounded.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And herein,’ say the old writers, ‘are lovers, who love truly, truly
      recompensed for their toils and pains; in that love, for which they
      suffer, is ever present to ward away suffering not sprung of love: but the
      disloyal, who serve not love faithfully, are a race given over to whatso
      this base world can wreak upon them, without consolation or comfort of
      their mistress, Love; whom sacrificing not all to, they know not to
      delight in.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The soul of a lover lives through every member of him in the joy of a
      moonlight ride. Sorrow and grief are slow distempers that crouch from the
      breeze, and nourish their natures far from swift-moving things. A true
      lover is not one of those melancholy flies that shoot and maze over muddy
      stagnant pools. He must be up in the great air. He must strike all the
      strings of life. Swiftness is his rapture. In his wide arms he embraces
      the whole form of beauty. Eagle-like are his instincts; dove-like his
      desires. Then the fair moon is the very presence of his betrothed in
      heaven. So for hours rode Farina in a silver-fleeting glory; while the
      Monk as a shadow, galloped stern and silent beside him. So, crowning them
      in the sky, one half was all love and light; one, blackness and fell
      purpose.

<h2>
      THE COMBAT ON DRACHENFELS
    </h2>
<p>
      Not to earth was vouchsafed the honour of commencing the great battle of
      that night. By an expiring blue-shot beam of moonlight, Farina beheld a
      vast realm of gloom filling the hollow of the West, and the moon was soon
      extinguished behind sluggish scraps of iron scud detached from the
      swinging bulk of ruin, as heavily it ground on the atmosphere in the first
      thunder-launch of motion.
    </p>
<p>
      The heart of the youth was strong, but he could not view without quicker
      fawning throbs this manifestation of immeasurable power, which seemed as
      if with a stroke it was capable of destroying creation and the works of
      man. The bare aspect of the tempest lent terrors to the adventure he was
      engaged in, and of which he knew not the aim, nor might forecast the
      issue. Now there was nothing to illumine their path but such forked
      flashes as lightning threw them at intervals, touching here a hill with
      clustered cottages, striking into day there a May-blossom, a patch of
      weed, a single tree by the wayside. Suddenly a more vivid and continuous
      quiver of violet fire met its reflection on the landscape, and Farina saw
      the Rhine-stream beneath him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On such a night,’ thought he, ‘Siegfried fought and slew the dragon!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A blast of light, as from the jaws of the defeated dragon in his throes,
      made known to him the country he traversed. Crimsoned above the water
      glimmered the monster-haunted rock itself, and mid-channel beyond, flat
      and black to the stream, stretched the Nuns’ Isle in cloistral peace.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Halt!’ cried the Monk, and signalled with a peculiar whistle, to which he
      seemed breathlessly awaiting an answer. They were immediately surrounded
      by longrobed veiled figures.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not too late?’ the Monk hoarsely asked of them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yet an hour!’ was the reply, in soft clear tones of a woman’s voice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Great strength and valour more than human be mine,’ exclaimed the Monk,
      dismounting.
    </p>
<p>
      He passed apart from them; and they drew in a circle, while he prayed,
      kneeling.
    </p>
<p>
      Presently he returned, and led Farina to a bank, drawing from some
      hiding-place a book and a bell, which he gave into the hands of the youth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For thy soul, no word!’ said the Monk, speaking down his throat as he
      took in breath. ‘Nay! not in answer to me! Be faithful, and more than
      earthly fortune is thine; for I say unto thee, I shall not fail, having
      grace to sustain this combat.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Thereupon he commenced the ascent of Drachenfels.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina followed. He had no hint of the Monk’s mission, nor of the part
      himself was to play in it. Such a load of silence gathered on his
      questioning spirit, that the outcry of the rageing elements alone
      prevented him from arresting the Monk and demanding the end of his service
      there. That outcry was enough to freeze speech on the very lips of a
      mortal. For scarce had they got footing on the winding path of the crags,
      when the whole vengeance of the storm was hurled against the mountain.
      Huge boulders were loosened and came bowling from above: trees torn by
      their roots from the fissures whizzed on the eddies of the wind: torrents
      of rain foamed down the iron flanks of rock, and flew off in hoar feathers
      against the short pauses of darkness: the mountain heaved, and quaked, and
      yawned a succession of hideous chasms.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There’s a devil in this,’ thought Farina. He looked back and marked the
      river imaging lurid abysses of cloud above the mountain-summit—yea!
      and on the summit a flaming shape was mirrored.
    </p>
<p>
      Two nervous hands stayed the cry on his mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have I not warned thee?’ said the husky voice of the Monk. ‘I may well
      watch, and think for thee as for a dog. Be thou as faithful!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He handed a flask to the youth, and bade him drink. Farina drank and felt
      richly invigorated. The Monk then took bell and book.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But half an hour,’ he muttered, ‘for this combat that is to ring through
      centuries.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Crossing himself, he strode wildly upward. Farina saw him beckon back
      once, and the next instant he was lost round an incline of the highest
      peak.
    </p>
<p>
      The wind that had just screamed a thousand death-screams, was now awfully
      dumb, albeit Farina could feel it lifting hood and hair. In the unnatural
      stillness his ear received tones of a hymn chanted below; now sinking, now
      swelling; as though the voices faltered between prayer and inspiration.
      Farina caught on a projection of crag, and fixed his eyes on what was
      passing on the height.
    </p>
<p>
      There was the Monk in his brown hood and wrapper, confronting—if he
      might trust his balls of sight—the red-hot figure of the Prince of
      Darkness.
    </p>
<p>
      As yet no mortal tussle had taken place between them. They were arguing:
      angrily, it was true: yet with the first mutual deference of practised
      logicians. Latin and German was alternately employed by both. It thrilled
      Farina’s fervid love of fatherland to hear the German Satan spoke: but his
      Latin was good, and his command over that tongue remarkable; for, getting
      the worst of the argument, as usual, he revenged himself by parodying one
      of the Church canticles with a point that discomposed his adversary, and
      caused him to retreat a step, claiming support against such shrewd
      assault.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The use of an unexpected weapon in warfare is in itself half a victory.
      Induce your antagonist to employ it as a match for you, and reckon on
      completely routing him...’ says the old military chronicle.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come!’ said the Demon with easy raillery. ‘You know your game—I
      mine! I really want the good people to be happy; dancing, kissing,
      propagating, what you will. We quite agree. You can have no objection to
      me, but a foolish old prejudice—not personal, but class; an
      antipathy of the cowl, for which I pardon you! What I should find in you
      to complain of—I have only to mention it, I am sure—is, that
      perhaps you do speak a little too much through your nose.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Monk did not fall into the jocular trap by retorting in the same
      strain.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Laugh with the Devil, and you won’t laugh longest,’ says the proverb.
    </p>
<p>
      Keeping to his own arms, the holy man frowned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Avaunt, Fiend!’ he cried. ‘To thy kingdom below! Thou halt raged over
      earth a month, causing blights, hurricanes, and epidemics of the deadly
      sins. Parley no more! Begone!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Demon smiled: the corners of his mouth ran up to his ears, and his
      eyes slid down almost into one.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Still through the nose!’ said he reproachfully.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I give thee Five Minutes!’ cried the Monk.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had hoped for a longer colloquy,’ sighed the Demon, jogging his left
      leg and trifling with his tail.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One Minute!’ exclaimed the Monk.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Truly so!’ said the Demon. ‘I know old Time and his habits better than
      you really can. We meet every Saturday night, and communicate our best
      jokes. I keep a book of them Down There!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And as if he had reason to remember the pavement of his Halls, he stood
      tiptoe and whipped up his legs.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Two Minutes!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Demon waved perfect acquiescence, and continued:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We understand each other, he and I. All Old Ones do. As long as he lasts,
      I shall. The thing that surprises me is, that you and I cannot agree,
      similar as we are in temperament, and playing for the long odds, both of
      us. My failure is, perhaps, too great a passion for sport, aha! Well, ‘tis
      a pity you won’t try and live on the benevolent principle. I am indeed
      kind to them who commiserate my condition. I give them all they want, aha!
      Hem! Try and not believe in me now, aha! Ho!... Can’t you? What are eyes?
      Persuade yourself you’re dreaming. You can do anything with a mind like
      yours, Father Gregory! And consider the luxury of getting me out of the
      way so easily, as many do. It is my finest suggestion, aha! Generally I
      myself nudge their ribs with the capital idea—You’re above bribes? I
      was going to observe—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Three!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Observe, that if you care for worldly honours, I can smother you with
      that kind of thing. Several of your first-rate people made a bargain with
      me when they were in the fog, and owe me a trifle. Patronage they call it.
      I hook the high and the low. Too-little and too-much serve me better than
      Beelzebub. A weak stomach is certainly more carnally virtuous than a full
      one. Consequently my kingdom is becoming too respectable. They’ve all got
      titles, and object to being asked to poke the fire without—Honourable-and-with-Exceeding-Brightness-Beaming

      don’t care for Beauty—Puella, Puellae? I have plenty of them, too,
      below. The Historical Beauties warmed up at a moment’s notice. Modern ones
      made famous between morning and night—Fame is the sauce of Beauty.
      Or, no—eh?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Four!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not quite so fast, if you please. You want me gone. Now, where’s your
      charity? Do you ask me to be always raking up those poor devils
      underneath? While I’m here, they’ve a respite. They cannot think you kind,
      Father Gregory! As for the harm, you see, I’m not the more agreeable by
      being face to face with you—though some fair dames do take to my
      person monstrously. The secret is, the quantity of small talk I can
      command: that makes them forget my smell, which is, I confess, abominable,
      displeasing to myself, and my worst curse. Your sort, Father Gregory, are
      somewhat unpleasant in that particular—if I may judge by their
      Legate here. Well, try small talk. They would fall desperately in love
      with polecats and skunks if endowed with small talk. Why, they have become
      enamoured of monks before now! If skunks, why not monks? And again—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Five!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Having solemnly bellowed this tremendous number, the holy man lifted his
      arms to begin the combat.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina felt his nerves prick with admiration of the ghostly warrior daring
      the Second Power of Creation on that lonely mountain-top. He expected, and
      shuddered at thought of the most awful fight ever yet chronicled of those
      that have taken place between heroes and the hounds of evil: but his
      astonishment was great to hear the Demon, while Bell was in air and Book
      aloft, retreat, shouting, ‘Hold!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I surrender,’ said he sullenly. ‘What terms?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Instantaneous riddance of thee from face of earth.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good!—Now,’ said the Demon, ‘did you suppose I was to be trapped
      into a fight? No doubt you wish to become a saint, and have everybody
      talking of my last defeat.... Pictures, poems, processions, with the Devil
      downmost! No. You’re more than a match for me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Silence, Darkness!’ thundered the Monk, ‘and think not to vanquish thy
      victor by flatteries. Begone!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And again he towered in his wrath.
    </p>
<p>
      The Demon drew his tail between his legs, and threw the forked, fleshy,
      quivering end over his shoulder. He then nodded cheerfully, pointed his
      feet, and finicked a few steps away, saying: ‘I hope we shall meet again.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Upon that he shot out his wings, that were like the fins of the
      wyver-fish, sharpened in venomous points.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Commands for your people below?’ he inquired, leering with chin awry.
      ‘Desperate ruffians some of those cowls. You are right not to acknowledge
      them.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina beheld the holy man in no mood to let the Enemy tamper with him
      longer.
    </p>
<p>
      The Demon was influenced by a like reflection; for, saying, ‘Cologne is
      the city your Holiness inhabits, I think?’ he shot up rocket-like over
      Rhineland, striking the entire length of the stream, and its rough-bearded
      castle-crests, slate-ledges, bramble-clefts, vine-slopes, and haunted
      valleys, with one brimstone flash. Frankfort and the far Main saw him and
      reddened. Ancient Trier and Mosel; Heidelberg and Neckar; Limberg and
      Lahn, ran guilty of him. And the swift artery of these shining veins,
      Rhine, from his snow cradle to his salt decease, glimmered Stygian horrors
      as the Infernal Comet, sprung over Bonn, sparkled a fiery minute along the
      face of the stream, and vanished, leaving a seam of ragged flame trailed
      on the midnight heavens.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina breathed hard through his teeth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The last of him was awful,’ said he, coming forward to where the Monk
      knelt and grasped his breviary, ‘but he was vanquished easily.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Easily?’ exclaimed the holy man, gasping satisfaction: ‘thou weakling! is
      it for thee to measure difficulties, or estimate powers? Easily? thou
      worldling! and so are great deeds judged when the danger’s past! And what
      am I but the humble instrument that brought about this wondrous conquest!
      the poor tool of this astounding triumph! Shall the sword say, This is the
      battle I won! Yonder the enemy I overthrow! Bow to me, ye lords of earth,
      and worshippers of mighty acts? Not so! Nay, but the sword is honoured in
      the hero’s grasp, and if it break not, it is accounted trusty. This, then,
      this little I may claim, that I was trusty! Trusty in a heroic encounter!
      Trusty in a battle with earth’s terror! Oh! but this must not be said.
      This is to think too much! This is to be more than aught yet achieved by
      man!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The holy warrior crossed his arms, and gently bowed his head.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Take me to the Sisters,’ he said. ‘The spirit has gone out of me! I am
      faint, and as a child!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina asked, and had, his blessing.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And with it my thanks!’ said the Monk. ‘Thou hast witnessed how he can be
      overcome! Thou hast looked upon a scene that will be the glory of
      Christendom! Thou hast beheld the discomfiture of Darkness before the
      voice of Light! Yet think not much of me: account me little in this
      matter! I am but an instrument! but an instrument!—and again, but an
      instrument!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina drew the arms of the holy combatant across his shoulders and
      descended Drachenfels.
    </p>
<p>
      The tempest was as a forgotten anguish. Bright with maiden splendour shone
      the moon; and the old rocks, cherished in her beams, put up their horns to
      blue heaven once more. All the leafage of the land shook as to shake off a
      wicked dream, and shuddered from time to time, whispering of old fears
      quieted, and present peace. The heart of the river fondled with the image
      of the moon in its depths.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is much to have won for earth,’ murmured the Monk. ‘And what is
      life, or who would not risk all, to snatch such loveliness from the talons
      of the Fiend, the Arch-foe? Yet, not I! not I! say not, ‘twas I did this!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Soft praises of melody ascended to them on the moist fragrance of air. It
      was the hymn of the Sisters.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How sweet!’ murmured the Monk. ‘Put it from me! away with it!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Rising on Farina’s back, and stirruping his feet on the thighs of the
      youth, he cried aloud: ‘I charge ye, whoso ye be, sing not this deed
      before the emperor! By the breath of your nostrils; pause! ere ye whisper
      aught of the combat of Saint Gregory with Satan, and his victory, and the
      marvel of it, while he liveth; for he would die the humble monk he is.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He resumed his seat, and Farina brought him into the circle of the
      Sisters. Those pure women took him, and smoothed him, lamenting, and
      filling the night with triumphing tones.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina stood apart.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The breeze tells of dawn,’ said the Monk; ‘we must be in Cologne before
      broad day.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      They mounted horse, and the Sisters grouped and reverenced under the
      blessings of the Monk.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No word of it!’ said the Monk warningly. ‘We are silent, Father!’ they
      answered. ‘Cologne-ward!’ was then his cry, and away he and Farina, flew.

<h2>
      THE GOSHAWK LEADS
    </h2>
<p>
      Morning was among the grey eastern clouds as they rode upon the camp
      hastily formed to meet the Kaiser. All there was in a wallow of confusion.
      Fierce struggles for precedence still went on in the neighbourhood of the
      imperial tent ground, where, under the standard of Germany, lounged some
      veterans of the Kaiser’s guard, calmly watching the scramble. Up to the
      edge of the cultivated land nothing was to be seen but brawling clumps of
      warriors asserting the superior claims of their respective lords.
      Variously and hotly disputed were these claims, as many red coxcombs
      testified. Across that point where the green field flourished, not a foot
      was set, for the Kaiser’s care of the farmer, and affection for good
      harvests, made itself respected even in the heat of those jealous
      rivalries. It was said of him, that he would have camped in a bog, or
      taken quarters in a cathedral, rather than trample down a green blade of
      wheat, or turn over one vine-pole in the empire. Hence the presence of
      Kaiser Heinrich was never hailed as Egypt’s plague by the peasantry, but
      welcome as the May month wherever he went.
    </p>
<p>
      Father Gregory and Farina found themselves in the centre of a group ere
      they drew rein, and a cry rose, ‘The good father shall decide, and all’s
      fair,’ followed by, ‘Agreed! Hail and tempest! he’s dropped down o’ 
      purpose.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father,’ said one, ‘here it is! I say I saw the Devil himself fly off
      Drachenfels, and flop into Cologne. Fritz here, and Frankenbauch, saw him
      too. They’ll swear to him: so ‘ll I. Hell’s thunder! will we. Yonder
      fellows will have it ‘twas a flash o’ lightning, as if I didn’t see him,
      horns, tail, and claws, and a mighty sight ‘twas, as I’m a sinner.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A clash of voices, for the Devil and against him, burst on this accurate
      description of the Evil spirit. The Monk sank his neck into his chest.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gladly would I hold silence on this, my sons,’ said he, in a supplicating
      voice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Speak, Father,’ cried the first spokesman, gathering courage from the
      looks of the Monk.
    </p>
<p>
      Father Gregory appeared to commune with himself deeply. At last, lifting
      his head, and murmuring, ‘It must be,’ he said aloud:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘‘Twas verily Satan, O my sons! Him this night in mortal combat I
      encountered and overcame on the summit of Drachenfels, before the eyes of
      this youth; and from Satan I this night deliver ye! an instrument herein
      as in all other.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Shouts, and a far-spreading buzz resounded in the camp. Hundreds had now
      seen Satan flying off the Drachenstein. Father Gregory could no longer
      hope to escape from the importunate crowds that beset him for particulars.
      The much-contested point now was, as to the exact position of Satan’s tail
      during his airy circuit, before descending into Cologne. It lashed like a
      lion’s. ‘Twas cocked, for certain! He sneaked it between his legs like a
      lurcher! He made it stumpy as a brown bear’s! He carried it upright as a
      pike!
    </p>
<p>
      ‘O my sons! have I sown dissension? Have I not given ye peace?’ exclaimed
      the Monk.
    </p>
<p>
      But they continued to discuss it with increasing frenzy.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina cast a glance over the tumult, and beheld his friend Guy beckoning
      earnestly. He had no difficulty in getting away to him, as the fetters of
      all eyes were on the Monk alone.
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk was stamping with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not a moment to be lost, my lad,’ said Guy, catching his arm. ‘Here, I’ve
      had half-a-dozen fights already for this bit of ground. Do you know that
      fellow squatting there?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina beheld the Thier at the entrance of a tumbledown tent. He was
      ruefully rubbing a broken head.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now,’ continued Guy, ‘to mount him is the thing; and then after the
      wolves of Werner as fast as horse-flesh can carry us. No questions! Bound,
      are you? And what am I? But this is life and death, lad! Hark!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk whispered something that sucked the blood out of Farina’s
      cheek.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Look you—what’s your lockjaw name? Keep good faith with me, and you
      shall have your revenge, and the shiners I promise, besides my lord’s
      interest for a better master: but, sharp! we won’t mount till we’re out of
      sight o’ the hell-scum you horde with.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Thier stood up and staggered after them through the camp. There was no
      difficulty in mounting him horses were loose, and scampering about the
      country, not yet delivered from their terrors of the last night’s tempest.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Here be we, three good men!’ exclaimed Guy, when they were started, and
      Farina had hurriedly given him the heads of his adventure with the Monk.
      ‘Three good men! One has helped to kick the devil: one has served an
      apprenticeship to his limb: and one is ready to meet him foot to foot any
      day, which last should be myself. Not a man more do we want, though it
      were to fish up that treasure you talk of being under the Rhine there, and
      guarded by I don’t know how many tricksy little villains. Horses can be
      ferried across at Linz, you say?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, thereabout,’ grunted the Thier.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We ‘re on the right road, then!’ said Guy. ‘Thanks to you both, I’ve had
      no sleep for two nights—not a wink, and must snatch it going—not
      the first time.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk bent his body, and spoke no more. Farina could not get a word
      further from him. By the mastery he still had over his rein, the Goshawk
      alone proved that he was of the world of the living. Schwartz Thier,
      rendered either sullen or stunned by the latest cracked crown he had
      received, held his jaws close as if they had been nailed.
    </p>
<p>
      At Linz the horses were well breathed. The Goshawk, who had been snoring
      an instant before, examined them keenly, and shook his calculating head.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Punch that beast of yours in the ribs,’ said he to Farina. ‘Ah! not a
      yard of wind in him. And there’s the coming back, when we shall have more
      to carry. Well: this is my lord’s money; but i’ faith, it’s going in a
      good cause, and Master Groschen will make it all right, no doubt; not a
      doubt of it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk had seen some excellent beasts in the stables of the Kaiser’s
      Krone; but the landlord would make no exchange without an advance of
      silver. This done, the arrangement was prompt.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Schwartz Thier!—I’ve got your name now,’ said Guy, as they were
      ferrying across, ‘you’re stiff certain they left Cologne with the maiden
      yesternoon, now?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah, did they! and she’s at the Eck safe enow by this time.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And away from the Eck this night she shall come, trust me!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Or there will I die with her!’ cried Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Fifteen men at most, he has, you said,’ continued Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Two not sound, five true as steel, and the rest shillyshally. ‘Slife, one
      lock loose serves us; but two saves us: five we’re a match for, throwing
      in bluff Baron; the remainder go with victory.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Can we trust this fellow?’ whispered Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Trust him!’ roared Guy. ‘Why, I’ve thumped him, lad; pegged and pardoned
      him. Trust him? trust me! If Werner catches a sight of that snout of his
      within half-a-mile of his hold, he’ll roast him alive.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He lowered his voice: ‘Trust him? We can do nothing without him. I knocked
      the devil out of him early this morning. No chance for his Highness
      anywhere now. This Eck of Werner’s would stand a siege from the Kaiser in
      person, I hear. We must into it like weasels; and out as we can.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Dismissing the ferry-barge with stern injunctions to be in waiting from
      noon to noon, the three leapt on their fresh nags.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Stop at the first village,’ said Guy; ‘we must lay in provision. As
      Master Groschen says, “Nothing’s to be done, Turpin, without provender.”’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Goshawk!’ cried Farina; ‘you have time; tell me how this business was
      done.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The only reply was a soft but decided snore, that spoke, like a voluptuous
      trumpet, of dreamland and its visions.
    </p>
<p>
      At Sinzig, the Thier laid his hand on Guy’s bridle, with the words, ‘Feed
      here,’ a brief, but effective, form of signal, which aroused the Goshawk
      completely. The sign of the Trauben received them. Here, wurst reeking
      with garlic, eggs, black bread, and sour wine, was all they could procure.
      Farina refused to eat, and maintained his resolution, in spite of Guy’s
      sarcastic chiding.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rub down the beasts, then, and water them,’ said the latter. ‘Made a vow,
      I suppose,’ muttered Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s the way of those fellows. No upright manly
      take-the-thing-as-it-comes; but fly-sky-high whenever there’s a dash on
      their heaven. What has his belly done to offend him? It will be crying out
      just when we want all quiet. I wouldn’t pay Werner such a compliment as go
      without a breakfast for him. Not I! Would you, Schwartz Thier?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Henker! not I!’ growled the Thier. ‘He’ll lose one sooner.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘First snatch his prey, or he’ll be making, God save us! a meal for a
      Kaiser, the brute.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Guy called in the landlady, clapped down the score, and abused the wine.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sir,’ said the landlady, ‘ours is but a poor inn, and we do our best.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So you do,’ replied the Goshawk, softened; ‘and I say that a civil tongue
      and rosy smiles sweeten even sour wine.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The landlady, a summer widow, blushed, and as he was stepping from the
      room, called him aside.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I thought you were one of that dreadful Werner’s band, and I hate him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Guy undeceived her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He took my sister,’ she went on, ‘and his cruelty killed her. He
      persecuted me even in the lifetime of my good man. Last night he came here
      in the middle of the storm with a young creature bright as an angel, and
      sorrowful—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He’s gone, you’re sure?’ broke in Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gone! Oh, yes! Soon as the storm abated he dragged her on. Oh! the way
      that young thing looked at me, and I able to do nothing for her.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, the Lord bless you for a rosy Christian!’ cried Guy, and, in his
      admiration, he flung his arm round her and sealed a ringing kiss on each
      cheek.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No good man defrauded by that! and let me see the fellow that thinks evil
      of it. If I ever told a woman a secret, I ‘d tell you one now, trust me.
      But I never do, so farewell! Not another?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Hasty times keep the feelings in a ferment, and the landlady was extremely
      angry with Guy and heartily forgave him, all within a minute.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No more,’ said she, laughing: ‘but wait; I have something for you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk lingered on a fretting heel. She was quickly under his elbow
      again with two flasks leaning from her bosom to her arms.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There! I seldom meet a man like you; and, when I do, I like to be
      remembered. This is a true good wine, real Liebfrauenmilch, which I only
      give to choice customers.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Welcome it is!’ sang Guy to her arch looks; ‘but I must pay for it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not a pfennig!’ said the landlady.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not one?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not one!’ she repeated, with a stamp of the foot.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In other coin, then,’ quoth Guy; and folding her waist, which did not
      this time back away, the favoured Goshawk registered rosy payment on a
      very fresh red mouth, receiving in return such lively discount, that he
      felt himself bound in conscience to make up the full sum a second time.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What a man!’ sighed the landlady, as she watched the Goshawk lead off
      along the banks; ‘courtly as a knight, open as a squire, and gentle as a
      page!’

<h2>
      WERNER’S ECK
    </h2>
<p>
      A league behind Andernach, and more in the wintry circle of the sun than
      Laach, its convenient monastic neighbour, stood the castle of Werner, the
      Robber Baron. Far into the South, hazy with afternoon light, a yellow
      succession of sandhills stretched away, spouting fire against the blue sky
      of an elder world, but now dead and barren of herbage. Around is a dusty
      plain, where the green blades of spring no sooner peep than they become
      grimed with sand and take an aged look, in accordance with the ungenerous
      harvests they promise. The aridity of the prospect is relieved on one side
      by the lofty woods of Laach, through which the sun setting burns
      golden-red, and on the other by the silver sparkle of a narrow winding
      stream, bordered with poplars, and seen but a glistening mile of its
      length by all the thirsty hills. The Eck, or Corner, itself, is thick-set
      with wood, but of a stunted growth, and lying like a dark patch on the
      landscape. It served, however, entirely to conceal the castle, and mask
      every movement of the wary and terrible master. A trained eye advancing on
      the copse would hardly mark the glimmer of the turrets over the topmost
      leaves, but to every loophole of the walls lies bare the circuit of the
      land. Werner could rule with a glance the Rhine’s course down from the
      broad rock over Coblentz to the white tower of Andernach. He claimed that
      march as his right; but the Mosel was no hard ride’s distance, and he
      gratified his thirst for rapine chiefly on that river, delighting in it,
      consequently, as much as his robber nature boiled over the bound of his
      feudal privileges.
    </p>
<p>
      Often had the Baron held his own against sieges and restrictions, bans and
      impositions of all kinds. He boasted that there was never a knight within
      twenty miles of him that he had not beaten, nor monk of the same limit not
      in his pay. This braggadocio received some warrant from his yearly
      increase of licence; and his craft and his castle combined, made him a
      notable pest of the region, a scandal to the abbey whose countenance he
      had, and a frightful infliction on the poorer farmers and peasantry.
    </p>
<p>
      The sun was beginning to slope over Laach, and threw the shadows of the
      abbey towers half-way across the blue lake-waters, as two men in the garb
      of husbandmen emerged from the wood. Their feet plunged heavily and their
      heads hung down, as they strode beside a wain mounted with straw,
      whistling an air of stupid unconcern; but a close listener might have
      heard that the lumbering vehicle carried a human voice giving them
      directions as to the road they were to take, and what sort of behaviour to
      observe under certain events. The land was solitary. A boor passing asked
      whether toll or tribute they were conveying to Werner. Tribute, they were
      advised to reply, which caused him to shrug and curse as he jogged on.
      Hearing him, the voice in the wain chuckled grimly. Their next speech was
      with a trooper, who overtook them, and wanted to know what they had in the
      wain for Werner. Tribute, they replied, and won the title of ‘brave pigs’ 
      for their trouble.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what’s the dish made of?’ said the trooper, stirring the straw with
      his sword-point.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tribute,’ came the answer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ha! You’ve not been to Werner’s school,’ and the trooper swung a
      sword-stroke at the taller of the two, sending a tremendous shudder
      throughout his frame; but he held his head to the ground, and only seemed
      to betray animal consciousness in leaning his ear closer to the wain.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Blood and storm! Will ye speak?’ cried the trooper.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never talk much; but an ye say nothing to the Baron,’—thrusting his
      hand into the straw—‘here’s what’s better than speaking.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well said!—Eh? Liebfrauenmilch? Ho, ho! a rare bleed!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Striking the neck of the flask on a wheel, the trooper applied it to his
      mouth, and ceased not deeply ingurgitating till his face was broad to the
      sky and the bottle reversed. He then dashed it down, sighed, and shook
      himself.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rare news! the Kaiser’s come: he’ll be in Cologne by night; but first he
      must see the Baron, and I’m post with the order. That’s to show you how
      high he stands in the Kaiser’s grace. Don’t be thinking of upsetting
      Werner yet, any of you; mind, now!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s Blass-Gesell,’ said the voice in the wain, as the trooper trotted
      on: adding, ‘‘gainst us.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Makes six,’ responded the driver.
    </p>
<p>
      Within sight of the Eck, they descried another trooper coming toward them.
      This time the driver was first to speak.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tribute! Provender! Bread and wine for the high Baron Werner from his
      vassals over Tonnistein.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And I’m out of it! fasting like a winter wolf,’ howled the fellow.
    </p>
<p>
      He was in the act of addressing himself to an inspection of the wain’s
      contents, when a second flask lifted in air, gave a sop to his curiosity.
      This flask suffered the fate of the former.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A Swabian blockhead, aren’t you?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, that country,’ said the driver. ‘May be, Henker Rothhals happens to
      be with the Baron?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To hell with him! I wish he had my job, and I his, of watching the
      yellow-bird in her new cage, till she’s taken out to-night, and then a
      jolly bumper to the Baron all round.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The driver wished him a fortunate journey, strongly recommending him to
      skirt the abbey westward, and go by the Ahr valley, as there was something
      stirring that way, and mumbling, ‘Makes five again,’ as he put the wheels
      in motion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Goshawk!’ said his visible companion; ‘what do you say now?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I say, bless that widow!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! bring me face to face with this accursed Werner quickly, my God!’ 
      gasped the youth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tusk! ‘tis not Werner we want—there’s the Thier speaking. No, no,
      Schwartz Thier! I trust you, no doubt; but the badger smells at a hole,
      before he goes inside it. We’re strangers, and are allowed to miss our
      way.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Leaving the wain in Farina’s charge, he pushed through a dense growth of
      shrub and underwood, and came crouching on a precipitous edge of shrouded
      crag, which commanded a view of the stronghold, extending round it, as if
      scooped clean by some natural action, about a stone’sthrow distant, and
      nearly level with the look-out tower. Sheer from a deep circular basin
      clothed with wood, and bottomed with grass and bubbling water, rose a
      naked moss-stained rock, on whose peak the castle firmly perched, like a
      spying hawk. The only means of access was by a narrow natural bridge of
      rock flung from this insulated pinnacle across to the mainland. One man,
      well disposed, might have held it against forty.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Our way’s the best,’ thought Guy, as he meditated every mode of gaining
      admission. ‘A hundred men an hour might be lost cutting steps up that
      steep slate; and once at the top we should only have to be shoved down
      again.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      While thus engaged, he heard a summons sounded from the castle, and
      scrambled back to Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Thier leads now,’ said he, ‘and who leads is captain. It seems easier
      to get out of that than in. There’s a square tower, and a round. I guess
      the maiden to be in the round. Now, lad, no crying out—You don’t
      come in with us; but back you go for the horses, and have them ready and
      fresh in yon watered meadow under the castle. The path down winds easy.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Man!’ cried Farina, ‘what do you take me for?—go you for the
      horses.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not for a fool,’ Guy rejoined, tightening his lip; ‘but now is your time
      to prove yourself one.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With you, or without you, I enter that castle!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! if you want to be served up hot for the Baron’s supper-mess, by all
      means.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thunder!’ growled Schwartz Thier, ‘aren’t ye moving?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk beckoned Farina aside.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Act as I tell you, or I’m for Cologne.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Traitor!’ muttered the youth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Swearing this, that if we fail, the Baron shall need a leech sooner than
      a bride.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That stroke must be mine!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk griped the muscle of Farina’s arm till the youth was compelled
      to slacken it with pain.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Could you drive a knife through a six-inch wood-wall? I doubt this wild
      boar wants a harder hit than many a best man could give. ‘Sblood! obey,
      sirrah. How shall we keep yon fellow true, if he sees we’re at points?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I yield,’ exclaimed Farina with a fall of the chest; ‘but hear I nothing
      of you by midnight—Oh! then think not I shall leave another minute
      to chance. Farewell! haste! Heaven prosper you! You will see her, and die
      under her eyes. That may be denied to me. What have I done to be refused
      that last boon?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gone without breakfast and dinner,’ said Guy in abhorrent tones.
    </p>
<p>
      A whistle from the wain, following a noise of the castlegates being flung
      open, called the Goshawk away, and he slouched his shoulders and strode to
      do his part, without another word. Farina gazed after him, and dropped
      into the covert.

<h2>
      THE WATER-LADY
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘Bird of lovers! Voice of the passion of love! Sweet, deep,
      disaster-toning nightingale!’ sings the old minnesinger; ‘who that has not
      loved, hearing thee is touched with the wand of love’s mysteries, and
      yearneth to he knoweth not whom, humbled by overfulness of heart; but who,
      listening, already loveth, heareth the language he would speak, yet
      faileth in; feeleth the great tongueless sea of his infinite desires
      stirred beyond his narrow bosom; is as one stript of wings whom the angels
      beckon to their silver homes: and he leaneth forward to ascend to them,
      and is mocked by his effort: then is he of the fallen, and of the fallen
      would he remain, but that tears lighten him, and through the tears stream
      jewelled shafts dropt down to him from the sky, precious ladders inlaid
      with amethyst, sapphire, blended jasper, beryl, rose-ruby, ether of heaven
      flushed with softened bloom of the insufferable Presences: and lo, the
      ladders dance, and quiver, and waylay his eyelids, and a second time he is
      mocked, aspiring: and after the third swoon standeth Hope before him with
      folded arms, and eyes dry of the delusions of tears, saying, Thou hast
      seen! thou hast felt! thy strength hath reached in thee so far! now shall
      I never die in thee!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For surely,’ says the minstrel, ‘Hope is not born of earth, or it were
      perishable. Rather know her the offspring of that embrace strong love
      straineth the heavens with. This owe we to thy music, bridal nightingale!
      And the difference of this celestial spirit from the smirking phantasy of
      whom all stand soon or late forsaken, is the difference between painted
      day with its poor ambitious snares, and night lifting its myriad tapers
      round the throne of the eternal, the prophet stars of everlasting time!
      And the one dieth, and the other liveth; and the one is unregretted, and
      the other walketh in thought-spun raiment of divine melancholy; her ears
      crowded with the pale surges that wrap this shifting shore; in her eyes a
      shape of beauty floating dimly, that she will not attain this side the
      water, but broodeth on evermore.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Therefore, hold on thy cherished four long notes, which are as the very
      edge where exultation and anguish melt, meet, and are sharpened to one
      ecstasy, death-dividing bird! Fill the woods with passionate chuckle and
      sob, sweet chaplain of the marriage service of a soul with heaven! Pour
      out thy holy wine of song upon the soft-footed darkness, till, like a
      priest of the inmost temple, ‘tis drunken with fair intelligences!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Thus the old minstrels and minnesingers.
    </p>
<p>
      Strong and full sang the nightingales that night Farina held watch by the
      guilty castle that entombed his living beloved. The castle looked itself a
      denser shade among the moonthrown shadows of rock and tree. The meadow
      spread like a green courtyard at the castle’s foot. It was of lush deep
      emerald grass, softly mixed with grey in the moon’s light, and showing
      like jasper. Where the shadows fell thickest, there was yet a mist of
      colour. All about ran a brook, and babbled to itself. The spring crocus
      lifted its head in moist midgrasses of the meadow, rejoiced with
      freshness. The rugged heights seemed to clasp this one innocent spot as
      their only garden-treasure; and a bank of hazels hid it from the castle
      with a lover’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The moon will tell me,’ mused Farina; ‘the moon will signal me the hour!
      When the moon hangs over the round tower, I shall know ‘tis time to
      strike.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The song of the nightingales was a full unceasing throb.
    </p>
<p>
      It went like the outcry of one heart from branch to branch. The four long
      notes, and the short fifth which leads off to that hurried gush of music,
      gurgling rich with passion, came thick and constant from under the
      tremulous leaves.
    </p>
<p>
      At first Farina had been deaf to them. His heart was in the dungeon with
      Margarita, or with the Goshawk in his dangers, forming a thousand
      desperate plans, among the red-hot ploughshares of desperate action.
      Finally, without a sense of being wooed, it was won. The tenderness of his
      love then mastered him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘God will not suffer that fair head to come to harm!’ he thought, and with
      the thought a load fell off his breast.
    </p>
<p>
      He paced the meadows, and patted the three pasturing steeds. Involuntarily
      his sight grew on the moon. She went so slowly. She seemed not to move at
      all. A little wing of vapour flew toward her; it whitened, passed, and the
      moon was slower than before. Oh! were the heavens delaying their march to
      look on this iniquity? Again and again he cried, ‘Patience, it is not
      time!’ He flung himself on the grass. The next moment he climbed the
      heights, and was peering at the mass of gloom that fronted the sky. It
      reared such a mailed head of menace, that his heart was seized with a
      quivering, as though it had been struck. Behind lay scattered some small
      faint-winkling stars on sapphire fields, and a stain of yellow light was
      in a breach of one wall.
    </p>
<p>
      He descended. What was the Goshawk doing? Was he betrayed? It was surely
      now time? No; the moon had not yet smitten the face of the castle. He made
      his way through the hazel-bank among flitting nightmoths, and glanced up
      to measure the moon’s distance. As he did so, a first touch of silver fell
      on the hoary flint.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, young bird of heaven in that Devil’s clutch!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Sounds like the baying of boar-hounds alarmed him. They whined into
      silence.
    </p>
<p>
      He fell back. The meadow breathed peace, and more and more the
      nightingales volumed their notes. As in a charmed circle of palpitating
      song, he succumbed to languor. The brook rolled beside him fresh as an
      infant, toying with the moonlight. He leaned over it, and thrice waywardly
      dipped his hand in the clear translucence.
    </p>
<p>
      Was it his own face imaged there?
    </p>
<p>
      Farina bent close above an eddy of the water. It whirled with a strange
      tumult, breaking into lines and lights a face not his own, nor the moon’s;
      nor was it a reflection. The agitation increased. Now a wreath of bubbles
      crowned the pool, and a pure water-lily, but larger, ascended wavering.
    </p>
<p>
      He started aside; and under him a bright head, garlanded with gemmed
      roses, appeared. No fairer figure of woman had Farina seen. Her visage had
      the lustrous white of moonlight, and all her shape undulated in a dress of
      flashing silver-white, wonderful to see. The Lady of the Water smiled on
      him, and ran over with ripples and dimples of limpid beauty. Then, as he
      retreated on the meadow grass, she swam toward him, and taking his hand,
      pressed it to her. After her touch the youth no longer feared. She curved
      her finger, and beckoned him on. All that she did was done flowingly. The
      youth was a shadow in her silver track as she passed like a harmless wave
      over the closed crocuses; but the crocuses shivered and swelled their
      throats of streaked purple and argent as at delicious rare sips of a wine.
      Breath of violet, and ladysmock, and valley-lily, mingled and fluttered
      about her. Farina was as a man working the day’s intent in a dream. He
      could see the heart in her translucent, hanging like a cold dingy ruby. By
      the purity of his nature he felt that such a presence must have come but
      to help. It might be Margarita’s guardian fairy!
    </p>
<p>
      They passed the hazel-bank, and rounded the castlecrag, washed by the
      brook and, beneath the advancing moon, standing in a ring of brawling
      silver. The youth with his fervid eyes marked the old weather-stains and
      scars of long defiance coming into colour. That mystery of wickedness
      which the towers had worn in the dusk, was dissolved, and he endured no
      more the almost abashed sensation of competing littleness that made him
      think there was nought to do, save die, combating single-handed such
      massive power. The moon shone calmly superior, like the prowess of maiden
      knights; and now the harsh frown of the walls struck resolution to his
      spirit, and nerved him with hate and the contempt true courage feels when
      matched against fraud and villany.
    </p>
<p>
      On a fallen block of slate, cushioned with rich brown moss and rusted
      weather-stains, the Water-Lady sat, and pointed to Farina the path of the
      moon toward the round tower. She did not speak, and if his lips parted,
      put her cold finger across them. Then she began to hum a soft sweet
      monotony of song, vague and careless, very witching to hear. Farina caught
      no words, nor whether the song was of days in dust or in flower, but his
      mind bloomed with legends and sad splendours of story, while she sang on
      the slate-block under sprinkled shadows by the water.
    </p>
<p>
      He had listened long in trance, when the Water-Lady hushed, and stretched
      forth a slender forefinger to the moon. It stood like a dot over the round
      tower. Farina rose in haste. She did not leave him to ask her aid, but
      took his hand and led him up the steep ascent. Halfway to the castle, she
      rested. There, concealed by bramble-tufts, she disclosed the low portal of
      a secret passage, and pushed it open without effort. She paused at the
      entrance, and he could see her trembling, seeming to wax taller, till she
      was like a fountain glittering in the cold light. Then she dropped, as
      drops a dying bet, and cowered into the passage.
    </p>
<p>
      Darkness, thick with earth-dews, oppressed his senses. He felt the clammy
      walls scraping close on him. Not the dimmest lamp, or guiding sound, was
      near; but the lady went on as one who knew her way. Passing a low-vaulted
      dungeon-room, they wound up stairs hewn in the rock, and came to a door,
      obedient to her touch, which displayed a chamber faintly misted by a
      solitary bar of moonlight. Farina perceived they were above the foundation
      of the castle. The walls gleamed pale with knightly harness, habergeons
      gaping for heads, breastplates of blue steel, halbert, and hand-axe,
      greaves, glaives, boar-spears, and polished spur-fixed heel-pieces. He
      seized a falchion hanging apart, but the lady stayed his arm, and led to
      another flight of stone ending in a kind of corridor. Noises of laughter
      and high feasting beset him at this point. The Lady of the Water sidled
      her head, as to note a familiar voice; and then drew him to a looped
      aperture.
    </p>
<p>
      Farina beheld a scene that first dazzled, but, as it grew into shape, sank
      him with dismay. Below, and level with the chamber he had left, a rude
      banqueting-hall glowed, under the light of a dozen flambeaux, with smoking
      boar’s flesh, deer’s flesh, stone-flagons, and horn-beakers. At the head
      of this board sat Werner, scarlet with furious feasting, and on his right
      hand, Margarita, bloodless as a beautiful martyr bound to the fire.
      Retainers of Werner occupied the length of the hall, chorusing the Baron’s
      speeches, and drinking their own healths when there was no call for
      another. Farina saw his beloved alone. She was dressed as when he parted
      with her last. The dear cameo lay on her bosom, but not heaving proudly as
      of old. Her shoulders were drooped forward, and contracted her bosom in
      its heaving. She would have had a humbled look, but for the marble
      sternness of her eyes. They were fixed as eyes that see the way of death
      through all earthly objects.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, dogs!’ cried the Baron, ‘the health of the night! and swell your
      lungs, for I’ll have no cat’s cry when Werner’s bride is the toast. Monk
      or no monk’s leave, she’s mine. Ay, my pretty one! it shall be made right
      in the morning, if I lead all the Laach rats here by the nose. Thunder! no
      disrespect to Werner’s bride from Pope or abbot. Now, sing out!—or
      wait! these fellows shall drink it first.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He stretched and threw a beaker of wine right and left behind him, and
      Farina’s despair stiffened his limbs as he recognized the Goshawk and
      Schwartz Thier strapped to the floor. Their beards were already moist with
      previous libations similarly bestowed, and they received this in sullen
      stillness; but Farina thought he observed a rapid glance of encouragement
      dart from beneath the Goshawk’s bent brows, as Margarita momentarily
      turned her head half-way on him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lick your chaps, ye beasts, and don’t say Werner stints vermin good cheer
      his nuptial-night. Now,’ continued the Baron, growing huskier as he talked
      louder: ‘Short and ringing, my devil’s pups:—Werner and his Bride!
      and may she soon give you a young baron to keep you in better order than I
      can, as, if she does her duty, she will.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Baron stood up, and lifted his huge arm to lead the toast.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Werner and his Bride!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Not a voice followed him. There was a sudden intimation of the call being
      echoed; but it snapped, and ended in shuffling tones, as if the hall-door
      had closed on the response.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What ‘s this?’ roared the Baron, in that caged wild beast voice Margarita
      remembered she had heard in the Cathedral Square.
    </p>
<p>
      No one replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Speak! or I’ll rot you a fathom in the rock, curs!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Herr Baron!’ said Henker Rothhals impressively; ‘the matter is, that
      there’s something unholy among us.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Baron’s goblet flew at his head before the words were uttered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ll make an unholy thing of him that says it,’ and Werner lowered at
      them one by one.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then I say it, Herr Baron!’ pursued Henker Rothhals, wiping his
      frontispiece: ‘The Devil has turned against you at last. Look up there—Ah,
      it’s gone now; but where’s the man sitting this side saw it not?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Baron made one spring, and stood on the board.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now! will any rascal here please to say so?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Something in the cruel hang of his threatening hatchet jaw silenced many
      in the act of confirming the assertion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Stand out, Henker Rotthals!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Rotthals slid a hunting-knife up his wrist, and stepped back from the
      board.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beast!’ roared the Baron, ‘I said I wouldn’t shed blood to-night. I
      spared a traitor, and an enemy——’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Look again!’ said Rothhals; ‘will any fellow say he saw nothing there.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      While all heads, including Werner’s, were directed to the aperture which
      surveyed them, Rothhals tossed his knife to the Goshawk unperceived.
    </p>
<p>
      This time answers came to his challenge, but not in confirmation. The
      Baron spoke with a gasping gentleness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So you trifle with me? I’m dangerous for that game. Mind you of
      Blass-Gesell? I made a better beast of him by sending him three-quarters
      of the road to hell for trial.’ Bellowing, ‘Take that!’ he discharged a
      broad blade, hitherto concealed in his right hand, straight at Rothhals.
      It fixed in his cheek and jaw, wringing an awful breath of pain from him
      as he fell against the wall.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There’s a lesson for you not to cross me, children!’ said Werner,
      striding his stumpy legs up and down the crashing board, and puffing his
      monstrous girth of chest and midriff. ‘Let him stop there awhile, to show
      what comes of thwarting Werner!—Fire-devils! before the baroness,
      too!—Something unholy is there? Something unholy in his jaw, I
      think!—Leave it sticking! He’s against meat last, is he? I’ll teach
      you who he’s for!—Who speaks?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      All hung silent. These men were animals dominated by a mightier brute.
    </p>
<p>
      He clasped his throat, and shook the board with a jump, as he squeaked,
      rather than called, a second time ‘Who spoke?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He had not again to ask. In this pause, as the Baron glared for his
      victim, a song, so softly sung that it sounded remote, but of which every
      syllable was clearly rounded, swelled into his ears, and froze him in his
      angry posture.
    </p>
<pre>
       ‘The blood of the barons shall turn to ice,
         And their castle fall to wreck,
        When a true lover dips in the water thrice,
         That runs round Werner’s Eck.

       ‘Round Werner’s Eck the water runs;
         The hazels shiver and shake:
        The walls that have blotted such happy suns,
         Are seized with the ruin-quake.

       ‘And quake with the ruin, and quake with rue,
         Thou last of Werner’s race!
        The hearts of the barons were cold that knew
         The Water-Dame’s embrace.

       ‘For a sin was done, and a shame was wrought,
         That water went to hide:
        And those who thought to make it nought,
         They did but spread it wide.

       ‘Hold ready, hold ready to pay the price,
         And keep thy bridal cheer:
        A hand has dipped in the water thrice,
         And the Water-Dame is here.’

<h2>
      THE RESCUE
    </h2>
<p>
      The Goshawk was on his feet. ‘Now, lass,’ said he to Margarita, ‘now is
      the time!’ He took her hand, and led her to the door. Schwartz Thier
      closed up behind her. Not a man in the hall interposed. Werner’s head
      moved round after them, like a dog on the watch; but he was dumb. The door
      opened, and Farina entered. He bore a sheaf of weapons under his arm. The
      familiar sight relieved Werner’s senses from the charm. He shouted to bar
      the prisoners’ passage. His men were ranged like statues in the hall.
      There was a start among them, as if that terrible noise communicated an
      instinct of obedience, but no more. They glanced at each other, and
      remained quiet.
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk had his eye on Werner. ‘Stand back, lass!’ he said to
      Margarita. She took a sword from Farina, and answered, with white lips and
      flashing eyes, ‘I can fight, Goshawk!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And shall, if need be; but leave it to me now, returned Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      His eye never left the Baron. Suddenly a shriek of steel rang. All fell
      aside, and the combatants stood opposed on clear ground. Farina, took
      Margarita’s left hand, and placed her against the wall between the Thier
      and himself. Werner’s men were well content to let their master fight it
      out. The words spoken by Henker Rothhals, that the Devil had forsaken him,
      seemed in their minds confirmed by the weird song which every one present
      could swear he heard with his ears. ‘Let him take his chance, and try his
      own luck,’ they said, and shrugged. The battle was between Guy, as
      Margarita’s champion, and Werner.
    </p>
<p>
      In Schwartz Thier’s judgement, the two were well matched, and he estimated
      their diverse qualities from sharp experience. ‘For short work the Baron,
      and my new mate for tough standing to ‘t!’ Farina’s summary in favour of
      the Goshawk was, ‘A stouter heart, harder sinews, and a good cause. The
      combat was generally regarded with a professional eye, and few prayers.
      Margarita solely there asked aid from above, and knelt to the Virgin; but
      her, too, the clash of arms and dire earnest of mortal fight aroused to
      eager eyes. She had not dallied with heroes in her dreams. She was as
      ready to second Siegfried on the crimson field as tend him in the silken
      chamber.
    </p>
<p>
      It was well that a woman’s heart was there to mark the grace and glory of
      manhood in upright foot-to-foot encounter. For the others, it was a mere
      calculation of lucky hits. Even Farina, in his anxiety for her, saw but
      the brightening and darkening of the prospect of escape in every attitude
      and hard-ringing blow. Margarita was possessed with a painful exaltation.
      In her eyes the bestial Baron now took a nobler form and countenance; but
      the Goshawk assumed the sovereign aspect of old heroes, who, whether
      persecuted or favoured of heaven, still maintained their stand,
      remembering of what stuff they were, and who made them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never,’ say the old writers, with a fervour honourable to their knowledge
      of the elements that compose our being, ‘never may this bright privilege
      of fair fight depart from us, nor advantage of it fail to be taken! Man
      against man, or beast, singly keeping his ground, is as fine rapture to
      the breast as Beauty in her softest hour affordeth. For if woman taketh
      loveliness to her when she languisheth, so surely doth man in these fierce
      moods, when steel and iron sparkle opposed, and their breath is fire, and
      their lips white with the lock of resolution; all their faculties knotted
      to a point, and their energies alive as the daylight to prove themselves
      superior, according to the laws and under the blessing of chivalry.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For all,’ they go on to improve the comparison, ‘may admire and delight
      in fair blossoming dales under the blue dome of peace; but ‘tis the rare
      lofty heart alone comprehendeth, and is heightened by, terrific splendours
      of tempest, when cloud meets cloud in skies black as the sepulchre, and
      Glory sits like a flame on the helm of Ruin’ 
    </p>
<p>
      For a while the combatants aired their dexterity, contenting themselves
      with cunning cuts and flicks of the sword-edge, in which Werner first drew
      blood by a keen sweep along the forehead of the Goshawk. Guy had allowed
      him to keep his position on the board, and still fought at his face and
      neck. He now jerked back his body from the hip, and swung a round stroke
      at Werner’s knee, sending him in retreat with a snort of pain. Before the
      Baron could make good his ground, Guy was level with him on the board.
    </p>
<p>
      Werner turned an upbraiding howl at his men. They were not disposed to
      second him yet. They one and all approved his personal battle with Fate,
      and never more admired him and felt his power; but the affair was
      exciting, and they were not the pillars to prop a falling house.
    </p>
<p>
      Werner clenched his two hands to his ponderous glaive, and fell upon Guy
      with heavier fury. He was becoming not unworth the little womanly
      appreciation Margarita was brought to bestow on him. The voice of the
      Water-Lady whispered at her heart that the Baron warred on his destiny,
      and that ennobles all living souls.
    </p>
<p>
      Bare-headed the combatants engaged, and the headpiece was the chief point
      of attack. No swerving from blows was possible for either: ward, or take;
      a false step would have ensured defeat. This also induced caution. Many a
      double stamp of the foot was heard, as each had to retire in turn.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at his head so much, he’ll bear battering there all night long,’ said
      Henker Rothhals in a breathing interval. Knocks had been pretty equally
      exchanged, but the Baron’s head certainly looked the least vulnerable,
      whereas Guy exhibited several dints that streamed freely. Yet he looked,
      eye and bearing, as fresh as when they began, and the calm, regular heave
      of his chest contrasted with Werner’s quick gasps. His smile, too, renewed
      each time the Baron paused for breath, gave Margarita heart. It was not a
      taunting smile, but one of entire confidence, and told all the more on his
      adversary. As Werner led off again, and the choice was always left him,
      every expression of the Goshawk’s face passed to full light in his broad
      eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      The Baron’s play was a reckless fury. There was nothing to study in it.
      Guy became the chief object of speculation. He was evidently trying to
      wind his man.
    </p>
<p>
      He struck wildly, some thought. Others judged that he was a random hitter,
      and had no mortal point in aim. Schwartz Thier’s opinion was frequently
      vented. ‘Too round a stroke—down on him! Chop-not slice!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Guy persevered in his own fashion. According to Schwartz Thier, he brought
      down by his wilfulness the blow that took him on the left shoulder, and
      nigh broke him. It was a weighty blow, followed by a thump of sound. The
      sword-edge swerved on his shoulder-blade, or he must have been disabled.
      But Werner’s crow was short, and he had no time to push success. One of
      the Goshawk’s swooping under-hits half severed his right wrist, and the
      blood spirted across the board. He gasped and seemed to succumb, but held
      to it still, though with slackened force. Guy now attacked. Holding to his
      round strokes, he accustomed Werner to guard the body, and stood to it so
      briskly right and left, that Werner grew bewildered, lost his caution, and
      gave ground. Suddenly the Goshawk’s glaive flashed in air, and chopped
      sheer down on Werner’s head. So shrewd a blow it was against a half-formed
      defence, that the Baron dropped without a word right on the edge of the
      board, and there hung, feebly grasping with his fingers.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who bars the way now?’ sang out Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      No one accepted the challenge. Success clothed him with terrors, and gave
      him giant size.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then fare you well, my merry men all,’ said Guy. ‘Bear me no ill-will for
      this. A little doctoring will right the bold Baron.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He strode jauntily to the verge of the board, and held his finger for
      Margarita to follow. She stepped forward. The men put their beards
      together, muttering. She could not advance. Farina doubled his elbow, and
      presented sword-point. Three of the ruffians now disputed the way with
      bare steel. Margarita looked at the Goshawk. He was smiling calmly curious
      as he leaned over his sword, and gave her an encouraging nod. She made
      another step in defiance. One fellow stretched his hand to arrest her. All
      her maidenly pride stood up at once. ‘What a glorious girl!’ murmured the
      Goshawk, as he saw her face suddenly flash, and she retreated a pace and
      swung a sharp cut across the knuckles of her assailant, daring him, or one
      of them, with hard, bright eyes, beautifully vindictive, to lay hand on a
      pure maiden.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have it, Barenleib!’ cried the others, and then to Margarita: ‘Look,
      young mistress! we are poor fellows, and ask a trifle of ransom, and then
      part friends.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not an ace!’ the Goshawk pronounced from his post.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Two to one, remember.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The odds are ours,’ replied the Goshawk confidently.
    </p>
<p>
      They ranged themselves in front of the hall-door. Instead of accepting
      this challenge, Guy stepped to Werner, and laid his moaning foe
      length-wise in an easier posture. He then lifted Margarita on the board,
      and summoned them with cry of ‘Free passage!’ They answered by a sullen
      shrug and taunt.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Schwartz Thier! Rothhals! Farina! buckle up, and make ready then,’ sang
      Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      He measured the length, of his sword, and raised it. The Goshawk had not
      underrated his enemies. He was tempted to despise them when he marked
      their gradually lengthening chaps and eyeballs.
    </p>
<p>
      Not one of them moved. All gazed at him as if their marrows were freezing
      with horror.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What’s this?’ cried Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      They knew as little as he, but a force was behind them irresistible
      against their efforts. The groaning oak slipped open, pushing them
      forward, and an apparition glided past, soft as the pallid silver of the
      moon. She slid to the Baron, and put her arms about him, and sang to him.
      Had the Water-Lady laid an iron hand on all those ruffians, she could not
      have held them faster bound than did the fear of her presence. The Goshawk
      drew his fair charge through them, followed by Farina, the Thier, and
      Rothhals. A last glimpse of the hall showed them still as old cathedral
      sculpture staring at white light on a fluted pillar of the wall.

<h2>
      THE PASSAGE OF THE RHINE
    </h2>
<p>
      Low among the swarthy sandhills behind the Abbey of Laach dropped the
      round red moon. Soft lengths of misty yellow stole through the glens of
      Rhineland. The nightingales still sang. Closer and closer the moon came
      into the hushed valleys.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a dell behind Hammerstein Castle, a ring of basking sward,
      girdled by a silver slate-brook, and guarded by four high-peaked hills
      that slope down four long wooded corners to the grassy base. Here, it is
      said, the elves and earthmen play, dancing in circles with laughing feet
      that fatten the mushroom. They would have been fulfilling the tradition
      now, but that the place was occupied by a sturdy group of mortals, armed
      with staves. The intruders were sleepy, and lay about on the inclines. Now
      and then two got up, and there rang hard echoes of oak. Again all were
      calm as cud-chewing cattle, and the white water ran pleased with quiet.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be that the elves brewed mischief among them; for the oaken blows
      were becoming more frequent. One complained of a kick: another demanded
      satisfaction for a pinch. ‘Go to,’ drawled the accused drowsily in both
      cases, ‘too much beer last night!’ Within three minutes, the company
      counted a pair of broken heads. The East was winning on the West in
      heaven, and the dusk was thinning. They began to mark, each, whom he had
      cudgelled. A noise of something swiftly in motion made them alert. A
      roebuck rushed down one of the hills, and scampered across the sward. The
      fine beast went stretching so rapidly away as to be hardly distinct.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sathanas once more!’ they murmured, and drew together.
    </p>
<p>
      The name passed through them like a watchword.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not he this time,’ cried the two new-comers, emerging from the foliage.
      ‘He’s safe under Cologne—the worse for all good men who live there!
      But come! follow to the Rhine! there ‘s work for us on the yonder side,
      and sharp work.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why,’ answered several, ‘we ‘ve our challenge with the lads of Leutesdorf
      and Wied to-day.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘D’ ye see this?’ said the foremost of the others, pointing to a carved
      ivory white rose in his cap.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Brothers!’ he swelled his voice, ‘follow with a will, for the White Rose
      is in danger!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Immediately they ranked, and followed zealously through the buds of young
      bushes, and over heaps of damp dead leaves, a half-hour’s scramble, when
      they defiled under Hammerstein, and stood before the Rhine. Their leader
      led up the river, and after a hasty walk, stopped, loosened his hood, and
      stripped.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now,’ said he, strapping the bundle to his back, ‘let me know the hound
      that refuses to follow his leader when the White Rose is in danger.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Long live Dietrich!’ they shouted. He dropped from the bank, and waded
      in. He was soon supported by the remainder of the striplings, and all
      struck out boldly into mid-stream.
    </p>
<p>
      Never heard history of a nobler Passage of the Rhine than this made
      between Andernach and Hammerstein by members of the White Rose Club,
      bundle on back, to relieve the White Rose of Germany from thrall and
      shame!
    </p>
<p>
      They were taken far down by the rapid current, and arrived panting to
      land. The dressing done, they marched up the pass of Tonnistein, and took
      a deep draught at the spring of pleasant waters there open to wayfarers.
      Arrived at the skirts of Laach, they beheld two farmer peasants lashed
      back to back against a hazel. They released them, but could gain no word
      of information, as the fellows, after a yawn and a wink, started off, all
      heels, to make sure of liberty. On the shores of the lake the brotherhood
      descried a body of youths, whom they hailed, and were welcomed to
      companionship.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where’s Berthold?’ asked Dietrich.
    </p>
<p>
      He was not present.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The more glory for us, then,’ Dietrich said.
    </p>
<p>
      It was here seriously put to the captain, whether they should not halt at
      the abbey, and reflect, seeing that great work was in prospect.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Truly,’ quoth Dietrich, ‘dying on an empty stomach is heathenish, and
      cold blood makes a green wound gape. Kaiser Conrad should be hospitable,
      and the monks honour numbers. Here be we, thirty and nine; let us go!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The West was dark blue with fallen light. The lakewaters were growing grey
      with twilight. The abbey stood muffled in shadows. Already the youths had
      commenced battering at the convent doors, when they were summoned by the
      voice of the Goshawk on horseback. To their confusion they beheld the
      White Rose herself on his right hand. Chapfallen Dietrich bowed to his
      sweet mistress.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We were coming to the rescue,’ he stammered.
    </p>
<p>
      A laugh broke from the Goshawk. ‘You thought the lady was locked up in the
      ghostly larder; eh!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich seized his sword, and tightened his belt.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Club allows no jesting with the White Rose, Sir Stranger.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita made peace. ‘I thank you all, good friends. But quarrel not, I
      pray you, with them that save me at the risk of their lives.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Our service is equal,’ said the Goshawk, flourishing, ‘Only we happen to
      be beforehand with the Club, for which Farina and myself heartily beg
      pardon of the entire brotherhood.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Farina!’ exclaimed Dietrich. ‘Then we make a prisoner instead of uncaging
      a captive.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What ‘s this?’ said Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So much,’ responded Dietrich. ‘Yonder’s a runaway from two masters: the
      law of Cologne, and the conqueror of Satan; and all good citizens are
      empowered to bring him back, dead or alive.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dietrich! Dietrich! dare you talk thus of the man who saved me?’ cried
      Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      Dietrich sullenly persisted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, look!’ said the White Rose, reddening under the pale dawn; ‘he
      shall not, he shall not go with you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      One of the Club was here on the point of speaking to the White Rose,—a
      breach of the captain’s privilege. Dietrich felled him unresisting to
      earth, and resumed:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It must be done, Beauty of Cologne! the monk, Father Gregory, is now
      enduring shame and scorn for lack of this truant witness.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Enough! I go!’ said Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You leave me?’ Margarita looked tender reproach. Weariness and fierce
      excitement had given a liquid flame to her eyes and an endearing darkness
      round their circles that matched strangely with her plump youth. Her
      features had a soft white flush. She was less radiant, but never looked so
      bewitching. An aspect of sweet human languor caught at the heart of love,
      and raised tumults.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is a duty,’ said Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then go,’ she beckoned, and held her hand for him to kiss. He raised it
      to his lips. This was seen of all the Club.
    </p>
<p>
      As they were departing with Farina, and Guy prepared to demand admittance
      into the convent, Dietrich chanced to ask how fared Dame Lisbeth. Schwartz
      Thier was by, and answered, with a laugh, that he had quite forgotten the
      little lady.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We took her in mistake for you, mistress! She was a one to scream! The
      moment she was kissed—mum as a cloister. We kissed her, all of us,
      for the fun of it. No harm—no harm! We should have dropped her when
      we found we had the old bird ‘stead of the young one, but reckoned ransom,
      ye see. She’s at the Eck, rattling, I’s wager, like last year’s nut in the
      shell!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lisbeth! Lisbeth! poor Lisbeth; we will return to her. Instantly,’ cried
      Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not you,’ said Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes! I!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No!’ said Guy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gallant Goshawk! best of birds, let me go!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Without me or Farina, never! I see I shall have no chance with my lord
      now. Come, then, come, fair Irresistible! come, lads. Farina can journey
      back alone. You shall have the renown of rescuing Dame Lisbeth.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Farina! forget not to comfort my father,’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      Between Margarita’s society and Farina’s, there was little dispute in the
      captain’s mind which choice to make. Farina was allowed to travel single
      to Cologne; and Dietrich, petted by Margarita, and gently jeered by Guy,
      headed the Club from Laach waters to the castle of the Robber Baron.

<h2>
      THE BACK-BLOWS OF SATHANAS
    </h2>
<p>
      Monk Gregory was pacing the high road between the Imperial camp and
      suffering Cologne. The sun had risen through interminable distances of
      cloud that held him remote in a succession of receding mounds and thinner
      veils, realm beyond realm, till he showed fireless, like a phantom king in
      a phantom land. The lark was in the breast of morning. The field-mouse ran
      along the furrows. Dews hung red and grey on the weedy banks and wayside
      trees. At times the nostril of the good father was lifted, and he beat his
      breast, relapsing into sorrowful contemplation. Passed-any citizen of
      Cologne, the ghostly head sunk into its cowl. ‘There’s a black raven!’ 
      said many. Monk Gregory heard them, and murmured, ‘Thou hast me, Evil one!
      thou hast me!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      It was noon when Farina came clattering down from the camp.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father,’ said he, ‘I have sought thee.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My son!’ exclaimed Monk Gregory with silencing hand, ‘thou didst not well
      to leave me contending against the tongues of doubt. Answer me not. The
      maiden! and what weighed she in such a scale?—No more! I am
      punished. Well speaks the ancient proverb:
    </p>
<pre>
        “Beware the back-blows of Sathanas!”
 </pre>
<p>
      I, that thought to have vanquished him! Vanity has wrecked me, in this
      world and the next. I am the victim of self-incense. I hear the demons
      shouting their chorus—“Here comes Monk Gregory, who called himself
      Conqueror of Darkness!” In the camp I am discredited and a scoff; in the
      city I am spat upon, abhorred. Satan, my son, fights not with his
      fore-claws. ‘Tis with his tail he fights, O Farina!—Listen, my son!
      he entered to his kingdom below through Cologne, even under the stones of
      the Cathedral Square, and the stench of him abominably remaineth,
      challenging the nostrils of holy and unholy alike. The Kaiser cannot
      approach for him; the citizens are outraged. Oh! had I held my peace in
      humbleness, I had truly conquered him. But he gave me easy victory, to
      inflate me. I shall not last. Now this only is left, my son; that thou
      bear living testimony to the truth of my statement, as I bear it to the
      folly!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina promised, in the face of all, he would proclaim and witness to his
      victory on Drachenfels.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That I may not be ranked an impostor!’ continued the Monk. ‘And how great
      must be the virtue of them that encounter that dark spirit! Valour
      availeth nought. But if virtue be not in’ ye, soon will ye be puffed to
      bursting with that devil’s poison, self-incense. Surely, my son, thou art
      faithful; and for this service I can reward thee. Follow me yet again.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      On the road they met Gottlieb Groschen, hastening to the camp. Dismay
      rumpled the old merchant’s honest jowl. Farina drew rein before him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your daughter is safe, worthy Master Groschen,’ said he.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Safe?’ cried Gottlieb; ‘where is she, my Grete?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina briefly explained. Gottlieb spread out his arms, and was going to
      thank the youth. He saw Father Gregory, and his whole frame narrowed with
      disgust.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you in company with that pestilent animal, that curse of Cologne!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The good Monk—,’ said Farina.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are leagued with him, then, sirrah! Expect no thanks from me.
      Cologne, I say, is cursed! Meddling wretches! could ye not leave Satan
      alone? He hurt us not. We were free of him. Cologne, I say, is cursed! The
      enemy of mankind is brought by you to be the deadly foe of Cologne.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      So saying, Gottlieb departed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Seest thou, my son,’ quoth the Monk, ‘they reason not!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina was dejected. Willingly would he, for his part, have left the soul
      of Evil a loose rover for the sake of some brighter horizon to his hope.
    </p>
<p>
      No twinge of remorse accompanied Gottlieb. The Kaiser had allotted him an
      encampment and a guard of honour for his household while the foulness
      raged, and there Gottlieb welcomed back Margarita and Aunt Lisbeth on the
      noon after his meeting with Farina. The White Rose had rested at Laach,
      and was blooming again. She and the Goshawk came trotting in advance of
      the Club through the woods of Laach, startling the deer with laughter, and
      sending the hare with her ears laid back all across country. In vain
      Dietrich menaced Guy with the terrors of the Club: Aunt Lisbeth begged of
      Margarita not to leave her with the footmen in vain. The joyous couple
      galloped over the country, and sprang the ditches, and leapt the dykes, up
      and down the banks, glad as morning hawks, entering Andernach at a round
      pace; where they rested at a hostel as capable of producing good Rhine and
      Mosel wine then as now. Here they had mid-day’s meal laid out in the
      garden for the angry Club, and somewhat appeased them on their arrival
      with bumpers of the best Scharzhofberger. After a refreshing halt, three
      boats were hired. On their passage to the river, they encountered a
      procession of monks headed by the Archbishop of Andernach, bearing a small
      figure of Christ carved in blackthorn and varnished: said to work
      miracles, and a present to the good town from two Hungarian pilgrims.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are ye for Cologne?’ the monks inquired of them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Direct down stream!’ they answered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Send, then, hither to us Gregory, the conqueror of Darkness, that he may
      know there is gratitude on earth and gratulation for great deeds,’ said
      the monks.
    </p>
<p>
      So with genuflexions the travellers proceeded, and entered the boats by
      the Archbishop’s White Tower. Hammerstein Castle and Rheineck they floated
      under; Salzig and the Ahr confluence; Rolandseck and Nonnenwerth;
      Drachenfels and Bonn; hills green with young vines; dells waving fresh
      foliage. Margarita sang as they floated. Ancient ballads she sang that
      made the Goshawk sigh for home, and affected the Club with delirious love
      for the grand old water that was speeding them onward. Aunt Lisbeth was
      not to be moved. She alone held down her head. She looked not Gottlieb in
      the face as he embraced her. Nor to any questioning would she vouchsafe
      reply. From that time forth, she was charity to woman; and the exuberant
      cheerfulness and familiarity of the men toward her soon grew kindly and
      respectful. The dragon in Aunt Lisbeth was destroyed. She objected no more
      to Margarita’s cameo.
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk quickly made peace with his lord, and enjoyed the commendation
      of the Kaiser. Dietrich Schill thought of challenging him; but the Club
      had graver business: and this was to pass sentence on Berthold Schmidt for
      the crime of betraying the White Rose into the hands of Werner. They had
      found Berthold at the Eck, and there consented to let him remain until
      ransom was paid for his traitorous body. Berthold in his mad passion was
      tricked by Werner, and on his release, by payment of the ransom, submitted
      to the judgement of the Club, which condemned him to fight them all in
      turn, and then endure banishment from Rhineland; the Goshawk, for his
      sister’s sake, interceding before a harsher tribunal.

<h2>
      THE ENTRY INTO COLOGNE
    </h2>
<p>
      Seven days Kaiser Heinrich remained camped outside Cologne. Six times in
      six successive days the Kaiser attempted to enter the city, and was
      foiled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beard of Barbarossa!’ said the Kaiser, ‘this is the first stronghold that
      ever resisted me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The warrior bishops, electors, pfalzgrafs, and knights of the Empire, all
      swore it was no shame not to be a match for the Demon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If,’ said the reflective Kaiser, ‘we are to suffer below what poor
      Cologne is doomed to undergo now, let us, by all that is savoury, reform
      and do penance.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The wind just then setting on them dead from Cologne made the courtiers
      serious. Many thought of their souls for the first time.
    </p>
<p>
      This is recorded to the honour of Monk Gregory.
    </p>
<p>
      On the seventh morning, the Kaiser announced his determination to make a
      last trial.
    </p>
<p>
      It was dawn, and a youth stood before the Kaiser’s tent, praying an
      audience.
    </p>
<p>
      Conducted into the presence of the Kaiser, the youth, they say, succeeded
      in arousing him from his depression, for, brave as he was, Kaiser Heinrich
      dreaded the issue. Forthwith order was given for the cavalcade to set out
      according to the rescript, Kaiser Heinrich retaining the youth at his
      right hand. But the youth had found occasion to visit Gottlieb and
      Margarita, each of whom he furnished with a flash, [flask?] curiously
      shaped, and charged with a distillation.
    </p>
<p>
      As the head of the procession reached the gates of Cologne, symptoms of
      wavering were manifest.
    </p>
<p>
      Kaiser Heinrich commanded an advance, at all cost.
    </p>
<p>
      Pfalzgraf Nase, as the old chronicles call him in their humour, but
      assuredly a great noble, led the van, and pushed across the draw-bridge.
    </p>
<p>
      Hesitation and signs of horror were manifest in the assemblage round the
      Kaiser’s person. The Kaiser and the youth at his right hand were cheery.
      Not a whit drooped they! Several of the heroic knights begged the Kaiser’s
      permission to fall back.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Follow Pfalzgraf Nase!’ the Kaiser is reported to have said.
    </p>
<p>
      Great was the wonderment of the people of Cologne to behold Kaiser
      Heinrich riding in perfect stateliness up the main street toward the
      Cathedral, while right and left of him bishops and electors were dropping
      incapable.
    </p>
<p>
      The Kaiser advanced till by his side the youth rode sole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thy name?’ said the Kaiser.
    </p>
<p>
      He answered: ‘A poor youth, unconquerable Kaiser! Farina I am called.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thy recompense?’ said the Kaiser.
    </p>
<p>
      He answered: ‘The hand of a maiden of Cologne, most gracious Kaiser and
      master!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She is thine!’ said the Kaiser.
    </p>
<p>
      Kaiser Heinrich looked behind him, and among a host grasping the pommels
      of their saddles, and reeling vanquished, were but two erect, a maiden and
      an old man.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is she, unconquerable Kaiser!’ Farina continued, bowing low.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It shall be arranged on the spot,’ said the Kaiser.
    </p>
<p>
      A word from Kaiser Heinrich sealed Gottlieb’s compliance.
    </p>
<p>
      Said he: ‘Gracious Kaiser and master! though such a youth could of himself
      never have aspired to the possession of a Groschen, yet when the Kaiser
      pleads for him, objection is as the rock of Moses, and streams consent.
      Truly he has done Cologne good service, and if Margarita, my daughter, can
      be persuaded—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The Kaiser addressed her with his blazing brows.
    </p>
<p>
      Margarita blushed a ready autumn of rosy-ripe acquiescence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A marriage registered yonder!’ said the Kaiser, pointing upward.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am thine, murmured Margarita, as Farina drew near her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Seal it! seal it!’ quoth the Kaiser, in hearty good humour; ‘take no
      consent from man or maid without a seal.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Farina tossed the contents of a flask in air, and saluted his beloved on
      the lips.
    </p>
<p>
      This scene took place near the charred round of earth where the Foulest
      descended to his kingdom below.
    </p>
<p>
      Men now pervaded Cologne with flasks, purifying the atmosphere. It became
      possible to breathe freely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We Germans,’ said Kaiser Heinrich, when he was again surrounded by his
      courtiers, ‘may go wrong if we always follow Pfalzgraf Nase; but this time
      we have been well led.’ Whereat there was obsequious laughter.
    </p>
<p>
      The Pfalzgraf pleaded a susceptible nostril.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thou art, I fear, but a timid mortal,’ said the Kaiser.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never have I been found so on the German Field, Imperial Majesty!’ 
      returned the Pfalzgraf. ‘I take glory to myself that this Nether reek
      overcomes me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Even that we must combat, you see!’ exclaimed Kaiser Heinrich; ‘but come
      all to a marriage this night, and take brides as soon as you will, all of
      you. Increase, and give us loyal subjects in plenty. I count prosperity by
      the number of marriages in my empire!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The White Rose Club were invited by Gottlieb to the wedding, and took it
      in vast wrath until they saw the Kaiser, and such excellent stout German
      fare present, when immediately a battle raged as to who should do the
      event most honour, and was in dispute till dawn: Dietrich Schill being the
      man, he having consumed wurst the length of his arm, and wine sufficient
      to have floated a St. Goar salmon; which was long proudly chronicled in
      his family, and is now unearthed from among the ancient honourable records
      of Cologne.
    </p>
<p>
      The Goshawk was Farina’s bridesman, and a very spiriting bridesman was he!
      Aunt Lisbeth sat in a corner, faintly smiling.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Child!’ said the little lady to Margarita when they kissed at parting,
      ‘your courage amazes me. Do you think? Do you know? Poor, sweet bird,
      delivered over hand and foot!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I love him! I love him, aunty! that’s all I know,’ said Margarita: ‘love,
      love, love him!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Heaven help you!’ ejaculated Aunt Lisbeth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pray with me,’ said Margarita.
    </p>
<p>
      The two knelt at the foot of the bride-bed, and prayed very different
      prayers, but to the same end. That done, Aunt Lisbeth helped undress the
      White Rose, and trembled, and told a sad nuptial anecdote of the Castle,
      and put her little shrivelled hand on Margarita’s heart, and shrieked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Child! it gallops!’ she cried.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘‘Tis happiness,’ said Margarita, standing in her hair.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May it last only!’ exclaimed Aunt Lisbeth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It will, aunty! I am humble: I am true’; and the fair girl gathered the
      frill of her nightgown.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Look not in the glass,’ said Lisbeth; ‘not to-night! Look, if you can,
      to-morrow.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She smoothed the White Rose in her bed, tucked her up, and kissed her,
      leaving her as a bud that waits for sunshine.

<h2>
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
<p>
      The shadow of Monk Gregory was seen no more in Cologne. He entered the
      Calendar, and ranks next St. Anthony. For three successive centuries the
      towns of Rhineland boasted his visits in the flesh, and the conqueror of
      Darkness caused dire Rhenish feuds.
    </p>
<p>
      The Tailed Infernal repeated his famous Back-blow on Farina. The youth
      awoke one morning and beheld warehouses the exact pattern of his own,
      displaying flasks shaped even as his own, and a Farina to right and left
      of him. In a week, they were doubled. A month quadrupled them. They
      increased.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Fame and Fortune,’ mused Farina, ‘come from man and the world: Love is
      from heaven. We may be worthy, and lose the first. We lose not love unless
      unworthy. Would ye know the true Farina? Look for him who walks under the
      seal of bliss; whose darling is for ever his young sweet bride, leading
      him from snares, priming his soul with celestial freshness. There is no
      hypocrisy can ape that aspect. Least of all, the creatures of the Damned!
      By this I may be known.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Seven years after, when the Goshawk came into Cologne to see old friends,
      and drink some of Gottlieb’s oldest Rudesheimer, he was waylaid by false
      Farinas; and only discovered the true one at last, by chance, in the
      music-gardens near the Rhine, where Farina sat, having on one hand
      Margarita, and at his feet three boys and one girl, over whom both bent
      lovingly, like the parent vine fondling its grape bunches in summer light.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
<p>
      An excursion beyond the immediate suburbs of London, projected long before
      his pony-carriage was hired to conduct him, in fact ever since his
      retirement from active service, led General Ople across a famous common,
      with which he fell in love at once, to a lofty highway along the borders
      of a park, for which he promptly exchanged his heart, and so gradually
      within a stone’s-throw or so of the river-side, where he determined not
      solely to bestow his affections but to settle for life. It may be seen
      that he was of an adventurous temperament, though he had thought fit to
      loosen his sword-belt. The pony-carriage, however, had been hired for the
      very special purpose of helping him to pass in review the lines of what he
      called country houses, cottages, or even sites for building, not too
      remote from sweet London: and as when Coelebs goes forth intending to
      pursue and obtain, there is no doubt of his bringing home a wife, the
      circumstance that there stood a house to let, in an airy situation, at a
      certain distance in hail of the metropolis he worshipped, was enough to
      kindle the General’s enthusiasm. He would have taken the first he saw, had
      it not been for his daughter, who accompanied him, and at the age of
      eighteen was about to undertake the management of his house. Fortune,
      under Elizabeth Ople’s guiding restraint, directed him to an epitome of
      the comforts. The place he fell upon is only to be described in the tongue
      of auctioneers, and for the first week after taking it he modestly
      followed them by terming it bijou. In time, when his own imagination,
      instigated by a state of something more than mere contentment, had been at
      work on it, he chose the happy phrase, ‘a gentlemanly residence.’ For it
      was, he declared, a small estate. There was a lodge to it, resembling two
      sentry-boxes forced into union, where in one half an old couple sat bent,
      in the other half lay compressed; there was a backdrive to discoverable
      stables; there was a bit of grass that would have appeared a meadow if
      magnified; and there was a wall round the kitchen-garden and a strip of
      wood round the flower-garden. The prying of the outside world was
      impossible. Comfort, fortification; and gentlemanliness made the place, as
      the General said, an ideal English home.
    </p>
<p>
      The compass of the estate was half an acre, and perhaps a perch or two,
      just the size for the hugging love General Ople was happiest in giving. He
      wisely decided to retain the old couple at the lodge, whose members were
      used to restriction, and also not to purchase a cow, that would have
      wanted pasture. With the old man, while the old woman attended to the bell
      at the handsome front entrance with its gilt-spiked gates, he undertook to
      do the gardening; a business he delighted in, so long as he could perform
      it in a gentlemanly manner, that is to say, so long as he was not
      overlooked. He was perfectly concealed from the road. Only one house, and
      curiously indeed, only one window of the house, and further to show the
      protection extended to Douro Lodge, that window an attic, overlooked him.
      And the house was empty.
    </p>
<p>
      The house (for who can hope, and who should desire a commodious house,
      with conservatories, aviaries, pond and boat-shed, and other joys of
      wealth, to remain unoccupied) was taken two seasons later by a lady, of
      whom Fame, rolling like a dust-cloud from the place she had left, reported
      that she was eccentric. The word is uninstructive: it does not frighten.
      In a lady of a certain age, it is rather a characteristic of aristocracy
      in retirement. And at least it implies wealth.
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople was very anxious to see her. He had the sentiment of humble
      respectfulness toward aristocracy, and there was that in riches which
      aroused his admiration. London, for instance, he was not afraid to say he
      thought the wonder of the world. He remarked, in addition, that the
      sacking of London would suffice to make every common soldier of the
      foreign army of occupation an independent gentleman for the term of his
      natural days. But this is a nightmare! said he, startling himself with an
      abhorrent dream of envy of those enriched invading officers: for Booty is
      the one lovely thing which the military mind can contemplate in the
      abstract. His habit was to go off in an explosion of heavy sighs when he
      had delivered himself so far, like a man at war with himself.
    </p>
<p>
      The lady arrived in time: she received the cards of the neighbourhood, and
      signalized her eccentricity by paying no attention to them, excepting the
      card of a Mrs. Baerens, who had audience of her at once. By express
      arrangement, the card of General Wilson Ople, as her nearest neighbour,
      followed the card of the rector, the social head of the district; and the
      rector was granted an interview, but Lady Camper was not at home to
      General Ople. She is of superior station to me, and may not wish to
      associate with me, the General modestly said. Nevertheless he was wounded:
      for in spite of himself, and without the slightest wish to obtrude his own
      person, as he explained the meaning that he had in him, his rank in the
      British army forced him to be the representative of it, in the absence of
      any one of a superior rank. So that he was professionally hurt, and his
      heart being in his profession, it may be honestly stated that he was
      wounded in his feelings, though he said no, and insisted on the
      distinction. Once a day his walk for constitutional exercise compelled him
      to pass before Lady Camper’s windows, which were not bashfully withdrawn,
      as he said humorously of Douro Lodge, in the seclusion of half-pay, but
      bowed out imperiously, militarily, like a generalissimo on horseback, and
      had full command of the road and levels up to the swelling park-foliage.
      He went by at a smart stride, with a delicate depression of his upright
      bearing, as though hastening to greet a friend in view, whose hand was
      getting ready for the shake. This much would have been observed by a
      housemaid; and considering his fine figure and the peculiar shining
      silveriness of his hair, the acceleration of his gait was noticeable. When
      he drove by, the pony’s right ear was flicked, to the extreme indignation
      of a mettlesome little animal. It ensued in consequence that the General
      was borne flying under the eyes of Lady Camper, and such pace displeasing
      him, he reduced it invariably at a step or two beyond the corner of her
      grounds.
    </p>
<p>
      But neither he nor his daughter Elizabeth attached importance to so
      trivial a circumstance. The General punctiliously avoided glancing at the
      windows during the passage past them, whether in his wild career or on
      foot. Elizabeth took a side-shot, as one looks at a wayside tree. Their
      speech concerning Lady Camper was an exchange of commonplaces over her
      loneliness: and this condition of hers was the more perplexing to General
      Ople on his hearing from his daughter that the lady was very fine-looking,
      and not so very old, as he had fancied eccentric ladies must be. The
      rector’s account of her, too, excited the mind. She had informed him
      bluntly, that she now and then went to church to save appearances, but was
      not a church-goer, finding it impossible to support the length of the
      service; might, however, be reckoned in subscriptions for all the
      charities, and left her pew open to poor people, and none but the poor.
      She had travelled over Europe, and knew the East. Sketches in watercolours
      of the scenes she had visited adorned her walls, and a pair of pistols,
      that she had found useful, she affirmed, lay on the writing-desk in her
      drawing-room. General Ople gathered from the rector that she had a great
      contempt for men: yet it was curiously varied with lamentations over the
      weakness of women. ‘Really she cannot possibly be an example of that,’ 
      said the General, thinking of the pistols.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, we learn from those who have studied women on the chess-board, and
      know what ebony or ivory will do along particular lines, or hopping, that
      men much talked about will take possession of their thoughts; and
      certainly the fact may be accepted for one of their moves. But the whole
      fabric of our knowledge of them, which we are taught to build on this
      originally acute perception, is shattered when we hear, that it is exactly
      the same, in the same degree, in proportion to the amount of work they
      have to do, exactly the same with men and their thoughts in the case of
      women much talked about. So it was with General Ople, and nothing is left
      for me to say except, that there is broader ground than the chessboard. I
      am earnest in protesting the similarity of the singular couples on common
      earth, because otherwise the General is in peril of the accusation that he
      is a feminine character; and not simply was he a gallant officer, and a
      veteran in gunpowder strife, he was also (and it is an extraordinary thing
      that a genuine humility did not prevent it, and did survive it) a lord and
      conqueror of the sex. He had done his pretty bit of mischief, all in the
      way of honour, of course, but hearts had knocked. And now, with his bright
      white hair, his close-brushed white whiskers on a face burnt brown, his
      clear-cut features, and a winning droop of his eyelids, there was powder
      in him still, if not shot.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a lamentable susceptibility to ladies’ charms. On the other
      hand, for the protection of the sex, a remainder of shyness kept him from
      active enterprise and in the state of suffering, so long as indications of
      encouragement were wanting. He had killed the soft ones, who came to him,
      attracted by the softness in him, to be killed: but clever women alarmed
      and paralyzed him. Their aptness to question and require immediate
      sparkling answers; their demand for fresh wit, of a kind that is not
      furnished by publications which strike it into heads with a hammer, and
      supply it wholesale; their various reading; their power of ridicule too;
      made them awful in his contemplation.
    </p>
<p>
      Supposing (for the inflammable officer was now thinking, and deeply
      thinking, of a clever woman), supposing that Lady Camper’s pistols were
      needed in her defence one night: at the first report proclaiming her
      extremity, valour might gain an introduction to her upon easy terms, and
      would not be expected to be witty. She would, perhaps, after the
      excitement, admit his masculine superiority, in the beautiful old fashion,
      by fainting in his arms. Such was the reverie he passingly indulged, and
      only so could he venture to hope for an acquaintance with the formidable
      lady who was his next neighbour. But the proud society of the burglarious
      denied him opportunity.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile, he learnt that Lady Camper had a nephew, and the young
      gentleman was in a cavalry regiment. General Ople met him outside his
      gates, received and returned a polite salute, liked his appearance and
      manners and talked of him to Elizabeth, asking her if by chance she had
      seen him. She replied that she believed she had, and praised his
      horsemanship. The General discovered that he was an excellent sculler. His
      daughter was rowing him up the river when the young gentleman shot by,
      with a splendid stroke, in an outrigger, backed, and floating alongside
      presumed to enter into conversation, during which he managed to express
      regrets at his aunt’s turn for solitariness. As they belonged to sister
      branches of the same Service, the General and Mr. Reginald Roller had a
      theme in common, and a passion. Elizabeth told her father that nothing
      afforded her so much pleasure as to hear him talk with Mr. Roller on
      military matters. General Ople assured her that it pleased him likewise.
      He began to spy about for Mr. Roller, and it sometimes occurred that they
      conversed across the wall; it could hardly be avoided. A hint or two, an
      undefinable flying allusion, gave the General to understand that Lady
      Camper had not been happy in her marriage. He was pained to think of her
      misfortune; but as she was not over forty, the disaster was, perhaps, not
      irremediable; that is to say, if she could be taught to extend her
      forgiveness to men, and abandon her solitude. ‘If,’ he said to his
      daughter, ‘Lady Camper should by any chance be induced to contract a
      second alliance, she would, one might expect, be humanized, and we should
      have highly agreeable neighbours.’ Elizabeth artlessly hoped for such an
      event to take place.
    </p>
<p>
      She rarely differed with her father, up to whom, taking example from the
      world around him, she looked as the pattern of a man of wise conduct.
    </p>
<p>
      And he was one; and though modest, he was in good humour with himself,
      approved himself, and could say, that without boasting of success, he was
      a satisfied man, until he met his touchstone in Lady Camper.

<h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<p>
      This is the pathetic matter of my story, and it requires pointing out,
      because he never could explain what it was that seemed to him so cruel in
      it, for he was no brilliant son of fortune, he was no great pretender,
      none of those who are logically displaced from the heights they have been
      raised to, manifestly created to show the moral in Providence. He was
      modest, retiring, humbly contented; a gentlemanly residence appeased his
      ambition. Popular, he could own that he was, but not meteorically; rather
      by reason of his willingness to receive light than his desire to shed it.
      Why, then, was the terrible test brought to bear upon him, of all men? He
      was one of us; no worse, and not strikingly or perilously better; and he
      could not but feel, in the bitterness of his reflections upon an
      inexplicable destiny, that the punishment befalling him, unmerited as it
      was, looked like absence of Design in the scheme of things, Above. It
      looked as if the blow had been dealt him by reckless chance. And to
      believe that, was for the mind of General Ople the having to return to his
      alphabet and recommence the ascent of the laborious mountain of
      understanding.
    </p>
<p>
      To proceed, the General’s introduction to Lady Camper was owing to a
      message she sent him by her gardener, with a request that he would cut
      down a branch of a wychelm, obscuring her view across his grounds toward
      the river. The General consulted with his daughter, and came to the
      conclusion, that as he could hardly despatch a written reply to a verbal
      message, yet greatly wished to subscribe to the wishes of Lady Camper, the
      best thing for him to do was to apply for an interview. He sent word that
      he would wait on Lady Camper immediately, and betook himself forthwith to
      his toilette. She was the niece of an earl.
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth commended his appearance, ‘passed him,’ as he would have said;
      and well she might, for his hat, surtout, trousers and boots, were worthy
      of an introduction to Royalty. A touch of scarlet silk round the neck gave
      him bloom, and better than that, the blooming consciousness of it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are not to be nervous, papa,’ Elizabeth said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all,’ replied the General. ‘I say, not at all, my dear,’ he
      repeated, and so betrayed that he had fallen into the nervous mood. ‘I was
      saying, I have known worse mornings than this.’ He turned to her and
      smiled brightly, nodded, and set his face to meet the future.
    </p>
<p>
      He was absent an hour and a half.
    </p>
<p>
      He came back with his radiance a little subdued, by no means eclipsed; as,
      when experience has afforded us matter for thought, we cease to shine
      dazzlingly, yet are not clouded; the rays have merely grown serener. The
      sum of his impressions was conveyed in the reflective utterance—‘It
      only shows, my dear, how different the reality is from our anticipation of
      it!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper had been charming; full of condescension, neighbourly,
      friendly, willing to be satisfied with the sacrifice of the smallest
      branch of the wych-elm, and only requiring that much for complimentary
      reasons.
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth wished to hear what they were, and she thought the request
      rather singular; but the General begged her to bear in mind, that they
      were dealing with a very extraordinary woman; ‘highly accomplished, really
      exceedingly handsome,’ he said to himself, aloud.
    </p>
<p>
      The reasons were, her liking for air and view, and desire to see into her
      neighbour’s grounds without having to mount to the attic.
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth gave a slight exclamation, and blushed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So, my dear, we are objects of interest to her ladyship,’ said the
      General.
    </p>
<p>
      He assured her that Lady Camper’s manners were delightful. Strange to
      tell, she knew a great deal of his antecedent history, things he had not
      supposed were known; ‘little matters,’ he remarked, by which his daughter
      faintly conceived a reference to the conquests of his dashing days. Lady
      Camper had deigned to impart some of her own, incidentally; that she was
      of Welsh blood, and born among the mountains. ‘She has a romantic look,’ 
      was the General’s comment; and that her husband had been an insatiable
      traveller before he became an invalid, and had never cared for Art. ‘Quite
      an extraordinary circumstance, with such a wife!’ the General said.
    </p>
<p>
      He fell upon the wych-elm with his own hands, under cover of the leafage,
      and the next day he paid his respects to Lady Camper, to inquire if her
      ladyship saw any further obstruction to the view.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘None,’ she replied. ‘And now we shall see what the two birds will do.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Apparently, then, she entertained an animosity to a pair of birds in the
      tree.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, yes; I say they chirp early in the morning,’ said General Ople.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘At all hours.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The song of birds...?’ he pleaded softly for nature.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If the nest is provided for them; but I don’t like vagabond chirping.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General perfectly acquiesced. This, in an engagement with a clever
      woman, is what you should do, or else you are likely to find yourself
      planted unawares in a high wind, your hat blown off, and your coat-tails
      anywhere; in other words, you will stand ridiculous in your bewilderment;
      and General Ople ever footed with the utmost caution to avoid that
      quagmire of the ridiculous. The extremer quags he had hitherto escaped;
      the smaller, into which he fell in his agile evasions of the big, he had
      hitherto been blest in finding none to notice.
    </p>
<p>
      He requested her ladyship’s permission to present his daughter. Lady
      Camper sent in her card.
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth Ople beheld a tall, handsomely-mannered lady, with good features
      and penetrating dark eyes, an easy carriage of her person and an agreeable
      voice, but (the vision of her age flashed out under the compelling eyes of
      youth) fifty if a day. The rich colouring confessed to it. But she was
      very pleasing, and Elizabeth’s perception dwelt on it only because her
      father’s manly chivalry had defended the lady against one year more than
      forty.
    </p>
<p>
      The richness of the colouring, Elizabeth feared, was artificial, and it
      caused her ingenuous young blood a shudder. For we are so devoted to
      nature when the dame is flattering us with her gifts, that we loathe the
      substitute omitting to think how much less it is an imposition than a form
      of practical adoration of the genuine.
    </p>
<p>
      Our young detective, however, concealed her emotion of childish horror.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper remarked of her, ‘She seems honest, and that is the most we
      can hope of girls.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She is a jewel for an honest man,’ the General sighed, ‘some day!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let us hope it will be a distant day.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yet,’ said the General, ‘girls expect to marry.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper fixed her black eyes on him, but did not speak.
    </p>
<p>
      He told Elizabeth that her ladyship’s eyes were exceedingly searching:
      ‘Only,’ said he, ‘as I have nothing to hide, I am able to submit to
      inspection’; and he laughed slightly up to an arresting cough, and made
      the mantelpiece ornaments pass muster.
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople was the hero to champion a lady whose airs of haughtiness
      caused her to be somewhat backbitten. He assured everybody, that Lady
      Camper was much misunderstood; she was a most remarkable woman; she was a
      most affable and highly intelligent lady. Building up her attributes on a
      splendid climax, he declared she was pious, charitable, witty, and really
      an extraordinary artist. He laid particular stress on her artistic
      qualities, describing her power with the brush, her water-colour sketches,
      and also some immensely clever caricatures. As he talked of no one else,
      his friends heard enough of Lady Camper, who was anything but a favourite.
      The Pollingtons, the Wilders, the Wardens, the Baerens, the Goslings, and
      others of his acquaintance, talked of Lady Camper and General Ople rather
      maliciously. They were all City people, and they admired the General, but
      mourned that he should so abjectly have fallen at the feet of a lady as
      red with rouge as a railway bill. His not seeing it showed the state he
      was in. The sister of Mrs. Pollington, an amiable widow, relict of a large
      City warehouse, named Barcop, was chilled by a falling off in his
      attentions. His apology for not appearing at garden parties was, that he
      was engaged to wait on Lady Camper.
    </p>
<p>
      And at one time, her not condescending to exchange visits with the
      obsequious General was a topic fertile in irony. But she did condescend.
      Lady Camper came to his gate unexpectedly, rang the bell, and was let in
      like an ordinary visitor. It happened that the General was gardening—not
      the pretty occupation of pruning—he was digging—and of
      necessity his coat was off, and he was hot, dusty, unpresentable. From
      adoring earth as the mother of roses, you may pass into a lady’s presence
      without purification; you cannot (or so the General thought) when you are
      caught in the act of adoring the mother of cabbages. And though he himself
      loved the cabbage equally with the rose, in his heart respected the
      vegetable yet more than he esteemed the flower, for he gloried in his
      kitchen garden, this was not a secret for the world to know, and he almost
      heeled over on his beam ends when word was brought of the extreme honour
      Lady Camper had done him. He worked his arms hurriedly into his fatigue
      jacket, trusting to get away to the house and spend a couple of minutes on
      his adornment; and with any other visitor it might have been accomplished,
      but Lady Camper disliked sitting alone in a room. She was on the square of
      lawn as the General stole along the walk. Had she kept her back to him, he
      might have rounded her like the shadow of a dial, undetected. She was
      frightfully acute of hearing. She turned while he was in the agony of
      hesitation, in a queer attitude, one leg on the march, projected by a
      frenzied tip-toe of the hinder leg, the very fatallest moment she could
      possibly have selected for unveiling him.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course there was no choice but to surrender on the spot.
    </p>
<p>
      He began to squander his dizzy wits in profuse apologies. Lady Camper
      simply spoke of the nice little nest of a garden, smelt the flowers,
      accepted a Niel rose and a Rohan, a Cline, a Falcot, and La France.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A beautiful rose indeed,’ she said of the latter, ‘only it smells of
      macassar oil.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Really, it never struck me, I say it never struck me before,’ rejoined
      the General, smelling it as at a pinch of snuff. ‘I was saying, I always
      ....’ And he tacitly, with the absurdest of smiles, begged permission to
      leave unterminated a sentence not in itself particularly difficult
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have a nose,’ observed Lady Camper.
    </p>
<p>
      Like the nobly-bred person she was, according to General Ople’s version of
      the interview on his estate, when he stood before her in his gardening
      costume, she put him at his ease, or she exerted herself to do so; and if
      he underwent considerable anguish, it was the fault of his excessive
      scrupulousness regarding dress, propriety, appearance.
    </p>
<p>
      He conducted her at her request to the kitchen garden and the handful of
      paddock, the stables and coach-house, then back to the lawn.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is the home for a young couple,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am no longer young,’ the General bowed, with the sigh peculiar to this
      confession. ‘I say, I am no longer young, but I call the place a
      gentlemanly residence. I was saying, I...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, yes!’ Lady Camper tossed her head, half closing her eyes, with a
      contraction of the brows, as if in pain.
    </p>
<p>
      He perceived a similar expression whenever he spoke of his residence.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps it recalled happier days to enter such a nest. Perhaps it had been
      such a home for a young couple that she had entered on her marriage with
      Sir Scrope Camper, before he inherited his title and estates.
    </p>
<p>
      The General was at a loss to conceive what it was.
    </p>
<p>
      It recurred at another mention of his idea of the nature of the residence.
      It was almost a paroxysm. He determined not to vex her reminiscences
      again; and as this resolution directed his mind to his residence, thinking
      it pre-eminently gentlemanly, his tongue committed the error of repeating
      it, with ‘gentleman-like’ for a variation.
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth was out—he knew not where. The housemaid informed him,
      that Miss Elizabeth was out rowing on the water.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is she alone?’ Lady Camper inquired of him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I fancy so,’ the General replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The poor child has no mother.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It has been a sad loss to us both, Lady Camper.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No doubt. She is too pretty to go out alone.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can trust her.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Girls!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has the spirit of a man.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is well. She has a spirit; it will be tried.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General modestly furnished an instance or two of her spiritedness.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper seemed to like this theme; she looked graciously interested.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Still, you should not suffer her to go out alone,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I place implicit confidence in her,’ said the General; and Lady Camper
      gave it up.
    </p>
<p>
      She proposed to walk down the lanes to the river-side, to meet Elizabeth
      returning.
    </p>
<p>
      The General manifested alacrity checked by reluctance. Lady Camper had
      told him she objected to sit in a strange room by herself; after that, he
      could hardly leave her to dash upstairs to change his clothes; yet how,
      attired as he was, in a fatigue jacket, that warned him not to imagine his
      back view, and held him constantly a little to the rear of Lady Camper,
      lest she should be troubled by it;—and he knew the habit of the
      second rank to criticise the front—how consent to face the outer
      world in such style side by side with the lady he admired?
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come,’ said she; and he shot forward a step, looking as if he had missed
      fire.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you not coming, General?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He advanced mechanically.
    </p>
<p>
      Not a soul met them down the lanes, except a little one, to whom Lady
      Camper gave a small silver-piece, because she was a picture.
    </p>
<p>
      The act of charity sank into the General’s heart, as any pretty
      performance will do upon a warm waxen bed.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper surprised him by answering his thoughts. ‘No; it’s for my own
      pleasure.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Presently she said, ‘Here they are.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople beheld his daughter by the river-side at the end of the lane,
      under escort of Mr. Reginald Rolles.
    </p>
<p>
      It was another picture, and a pleasing one. The young lady and the young
      gentleman wore boating hats, and were both dressed in white, and standing
      by or just turning from the outrigger and light skiff they were about to
      leave in charge of a waterman. Elizabeth stretched a finger at
      arm’s-length, issuing directions, which Mr. Rolles took up and worded
      further to the man, for the sake of emphasis; and he, rather than
      Elizabeth, was guilty of the half-start at sight of the persons who were
      approaching.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My nephew, you should know, is intended for a working soldier,’ said Lady
      Camper; ‘I like that sort of soldier best.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople drooped his shoulders at the personal compliment.
    </p>
<p>
      She resumed. ‘His pay is a matter of importance to him. You are aware of
      the smallness of a subaltern’s pay.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I,’ said the General, ‘I say I feel my poor half-pay, having always been
      a working soldier myself, very important, I was saying, very important to
      me!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you retire?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her interest in him seemed promising. He replied conscientiously, ‘Beyond
      the duties of General of Brigade, I could not, I say I could not, dare to
      aspire; I can accept and execute orders; I shrink from responsibility!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is a pity,’ said she, ‘that you were not, like my nephew Reginald,
      entirely dependent on your profession.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She laid such stress on her remark, that the General, who had just
      expressed a very modest estimate of his abilities, was unable to reject
      the flattery of her assuming him to be a man of some fortune. He coughed,
      and said, ‘Very little.’ The thought came to him that he might have to
      make a statement to her in time, and he emphasized, ‘Very little indeed.
      Sufficient,’ he assured her, ‘for a gentlemanly appearance.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have given you your warning,’ was her inscrutable rejoinder, uttered
      within earshot of the young people, to whom, especially to Elizabeth, she
      was gracious. The damsel’s boating uniform was praised, and her sunny
      flush of exercise and exposure.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper regretted that she could not abandon her parasol: ‘I freckle
      so easily.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General, puzzling over her strange words about a warning, gazed at the
      red rose of art on her cheek with an air of profound abstraction.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I freckle so easily,’ she repeated, dropping her parasol to defend her
      face from the calculating scrutiny.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I burn brown,’ said Elizabeth.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper laid the bud of a Falcot rose against the young girl’s cheek,
      but fetched streams of colour, that overwhelmed the momentary comparison
      of the sunswarthed skin with the rich dusky yellow of the rose in its
      deepening inward to soft brown.
    </p>
<p>
      Reginald stretched his hand for the privileged flower, and she let him
      take it; then she looked at the General; but the General was looking, with
      his usual air of satisfaction, nowhere.

<h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘Lady Camper is no common enigma,’ General Ople observed to his daughter.
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth inclined to be pleased with her, for at her suggestion the
      General had bought a couple of horses, that she might ride in the park,
      accompanied by her father or the little groom. Still, the great lady was
      hard to read. She tested the resources of his income by all sorts of
      instigation to expenditure, which his gallantry could not withstand; she
      encouraged him to talk of his deeds in arms; she was friendly, almost
      affectionate, and most bountiful in the presents of fruit, peaches,
      nectarines, grapes, and hot-house wonders, that she showered on his table;
      but she was an enigma in her evident dissatisfaction with him for
      something he seemed to have left unsaid. And what could that be?
    </p>
<p>
      At their last interview she had asked him, ‘Are you sure, General, you
      have nothing more to tell me?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And as he remarked, when relating it to Elizabeth, ‘One might really be
      tempted to misapprehend her ladyship’s... I say one might commit oneself
      beyond recovery. Now, my dear, what do you think she intended?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth was ‘burning brown,’ or darkly blushing, as her manner was.
    </p>
<p>
      She answered, ‘I am certain you know of nothing that would interest her;
      nothing, unless...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well?’ the General urged her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How can I speak it, papa?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You really can’t mean...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Papa, what could I mean?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If I were fool enough!’ he murmured. ‘No, no, I am an old man. I was
      saying, I am past the age of folly.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      One day Elizabeth came home from her ride in a thoughtful mood. She had
      not, further than has been mentioned, incited her father to think of the
      age of folly; but voluntarily or not, Lady Camper had, by an excess of
      graciousness amounting to downright invitation; as thus, ‘Will you persist
      in withholding your confidence from me, General?’ She added, ‘I am not so
      difficult a person.’ These prompting speeches occurred on the morning of
      the day when Elizabeth sat at his table, after a long ride into the
      country, profoundly meditative.
    </p>
<p>
      A note was handed to General Ople, with the request that he would step in
      to speak with Lady Camper in the course of the evening, or next morning.
      Elizabeth waited till his hat was on, then said, ‘Papa, on my ride to-day,
      I met Mr. Rolles.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am glad you had an agreeable escort, my dear.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I could not refuse his company.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly not. And where did you ride?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To a beautiful valley; and there we met.... ‘
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Her ladyship?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She always admires you on horseback.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So you know it, papa, if she should speak of it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And I am bound to tell you, my child,’ said the General, ‘that this
      morning Lady Camper’s manner to me was... if I were a fool... I say, this
      morning I beat a retreat, but apparently she... I see no way out of it,
      supposing she...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am sure she esteems you, dear papa,’ said Elizabeth. ‘You take to her,
      my dear?’ the General inquired anxiously; ‘a little?—a little afraid
      of her?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A little,’ Elizabeth replied, ‘only a little.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t be agitated about me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, papa; you are sure to do right.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you are trembling.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! no. I wish you success.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople was overjoyed to be reinforced by his daughter’s good wishes.
      He kissed her to thank her. He turned back to her to kiss her again. She
      had greatly lightened the difficulty at least of a delicate position.
    </p>
<p>
      It was just like the imperious nature of Lady Camper to summon him in the
      evening to terminate the conversation of the morning, from the visible
      pitfall of which he had beaten a rather precipitate retreat. But if his
      daughter cordially wished him success, and Lady Camper offered him the
      crown of it, why then he had only to pluck up spirit, like a good
      commander who has to pass a fordable river in the enemy’s presence; a
      dash, a splash, a rattling volley or two, and you are over, established on
      the opposite bank. But you must be positive of victory, otherwise, with
      the river behind you, your new position is likely to be ticklish. So the
      General entered Lady Camper’s drawing-room warily, watching the fair
      enemy. He knew he was captivating, his old conquests whispered in his
      ears, and her reception of him all but pointed to a footstool at her feet.
      He might have fallen there at once, had he not remembered a hint that Mr.
      Reginald Rolles had dropped concerning Lady Camper’s amazing variability.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper began.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘General, you ran away from me this morning. Let me speak. And, by the
      way, I must reproach you; you should not have left it to me. Things have
      now gone so far that I cannot pretend to be blind. I know your feelings as
      a father. Your daughter’s happiness...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My lady,’ the General interposed, ‘I have her distinct assurance that it
      is, I say it is wrapt up in mine.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let me speak. Young people will say anything. Well, they have a certain
      excuse for selfishness; we have not. I am in some degree bound to my
      nephew; he is my sister’s son.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Assuredly, my lady. I would not stand in his light, be quite assured. If
      I am, I was saying if I am not mistaken, I... and he is, or has the making
      of an excellent soldier in him, and is likely to be a distinguished
      cavalry officer.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He has to carve his own way in the world, General.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘All good soldiers have, my lady. And if my position is not, after a
      considerable term of service, I say if...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To continue,’ said Lady Camper: ‘I never have liked early marriages. I
      was married in my teens before I knew men. Now I do know them, and
      now....’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General plunged forward: ‘The honour you do us now:—a mature
      experience is worth:—my dear Lady Camper, I have admired you:—and
      your objection to early marriages cannot apply to... indeed, madam,
      vigour, they say... though youth, of course... yet young people, as you
      observe... and I have, though perhaps my reputation is against it, I was
      saying I have a natural timidity with your sex, and I am grey-headed,
      white-headed, but happily without a single malady.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper’s brows showed a trifling bewilderment. ‘I am speaking of
      these young people, General Ople.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I consent to everything beforehand, my dear lady. He should be, I say Mr.
      Rolles should be provided for.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So should she, General, so should Elizabeth.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She shall be, she will, dear madam. What I have, with your permission, if—good
      heaven! Lady Camper, I scarcely know where I am. She would .... I shall
      not like to lose her: you would not wish it. In time she will.... she has
      every quality of a good wife.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There, stay there, and be intelligible,’ said Lady Camper. ‘She has every
      quality. Money should be one of them. Has she money?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! my lady,’ the General exclaimed, ‘we shall not come upon your purse
      when her time comes.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Has she ten thousand pounds?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Elizabeth? She will have, at her father’s death... but as for my income,
      it is moderate, and only sufficient to maintain a gentlemanly appearance
      in proper self-respect. I make no show. I say I make no show. A wealthy
      marriage is the last thing on earth I should have aimed at. I prefer quiet
      and retirement. Personally, I mean. That is my personal taste. But if the
      lady... I say if it should happen that the lady ... and indeed I am not
      one to press a suit: but if she who distinguishes and honours me should
      chance to be wealthy, all I can do is to leave her wealth at her disposal,
      and that I do: I do that unreservedly. I feel I am very confused,
      alarmingly confused. Your ladyship merits a superior... I trust I have
      not... I am entirely at your ladyship’s mercy.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you prepared, if your daughter is asked in marriage, to settle ten
      thousand pounds on her, General Ople?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General collected himself. In his heart he thoroughly appreciated the
      moral beauty of Lady Camper’s extreme solicitude on behalf of his
      daughter’s provision; but he would have desired a postponement of that and
      other material questions belonging to a distant future until his own fate
      was decided.
    </p>
<p>
      So he said: ‘Your ladyship’s generosity is very marked. I say it is very
      marked.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How, my good General Ople! how is it marked in any degree?’ cried Lady
      Camper. ‘I am not generous. I don’t pretend to be; and certainly I don’t
      want the young people to think me so. I want to be just. I have assumed
      that you intend to be the same. Then will you do me the favour to reply to
      me?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General smiled winningly and intently, to show her that he prized her,
      and would not let her escape his eulogies.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Marked, in this way, dear madam, that you think of my daughter’s future
      more than I. I say, more than her father himself does. I know I ought to
      speak more warmly, I feel warmly. I was never an eloquent man, and if you
      take me as a soldier, I am, as, I have ever been in the service, I was
      saying I am Wilson Ople, of the grade of General, to be relied on for
      executing orders; and, madam, you are Lady Camper, and you command me. I
      cannot be more precise. In fact, it is the feeling of the necessity for
      keeping close to the business that destroys what I would say. I am in fact
      lamentably incompetent to conduct my own case.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper left her chair.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dear me, this is very strange, unless I am singularly in error,’ she
      said.
    </p>
<p>
      The General now faintly guessed that he might be in error, for his part.
    </p>
<p>
      But he had burned his ships, blown up his bridges; retreat could not be
      thought of.
    </p>
<p>
      He stood, his head bent and appealing to her sideface, like one pleadingly
      in pursuit, and very deferentially, with a courteous vehemence, he
      entreated first her ladyship’s pardon for his presumption, and then the
      gift of her ladyship’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
      As for his language, it was the tongue of General Ople. But his bearing
      was fine. If his clipped white silken hair spoke of age, his figure
      breathed manliness. He was a picture, and she loved pictures.
    </p>
<p>
      For his own sake, she begged him to cease. She dreaded to hear of
      something ‘gentlemanly.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is a new idea to me, my dear General,’ she said. ‘You must give me
      time. People at our age have to think of fitness. Of course, in a sense,
      we are both free to do as we like. Perhaps I may be of some aid to you. My
      preference is for absolute independence. And I wished to talk of a
      different affair. Come to me tomorrow. Do not be hurt if I decide that we
      had better remain as we are.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General bowed. His efforts, and the wavering of the fair enemy’s flag,
      had inspired him with a positive re-awakening of masculine passion to gain
      this fortress. He said well: ‘I have, then, the happiness, madam, of being
      allowed to hope until to-morrrow?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She replied, ‘I would not deprive you of a moment of happiness. Bring good
      sense with you when you do come.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General asked eagerly, ‘I have your ladyship’s permission to come
      early?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Consult your happiness,’ she answered; and if to his mind she seemed
      returning to the state of enigma, it was on the whole deliciously. She
      restored him his youth. He told Elizabeth that night; he really must begin
      to think of marrying her to some worthy young fellow. ‘Though,’ said he,
      with an air of frank intoxication, ‘my opinion is, the young ones are not
      so lively as the old in these days, or I should have been besieged before
      now.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The exact substance of the interview he forbore to relate to his
      inquisitive daughter, with a very honourable discretion.

<h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<p>
      Elizabeth came riding home to breakfast from a gallop round the park, and
      passing Lady Camper’s gates, received the salutation of her parasol. Lady
      Camper talked with her through the bars. There was not a sign to tell of a
      change or twist in her neighbourly affability. She remarked simply enough,
      that it was her nephew’s habit to take early gallops, and possibly
      Elizabeth might have seen him, for his quarters were proximate; but she
      did not demand an answer. She had passed a rather restless night, she
      said. ‘How is the General?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Papa must have slept soundly, for he usually calls to me through his door
      when he hears I am up,’ said Elizabeth.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper nodded kindly and walked on.
    </p>
<p>
      Early in the morning General Ople was ready for battle. His forces were,
      the anticipation of victory, a carefully arranged toilet, and an
      unaccustomed spirit of enterprise in the realms of speech; for he was no
      longer in such awe of Lady Camper.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have slept well?’ she inquired.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Excellently, my lady:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, your daughter tells me she heard you, as she went by your door in
      the morning for a ride to meet my nephew. You are, I shall assume,
      prepared for business.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Elizabeth?... to meet...?’ General Ople’s impression of anything
      extraneous to his emotion was feeble and passed instantly. ‘Prepared! Oh,
      certainly’; and he struck in a compliment on her ladyship’s fresh morning
      bloom.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It can hardly be visible,’ she responded; ‘I have not painted yet.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Does your ladyship proceed to your painting in the very early morning?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rouge. I rouge.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dear me! I should not have supposed it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have speculated on it very openly, General. I remember your trying to
      see a freckle through the rouge; but the truth is, I am of a supernatural
      paleness if I do not rouge, so I do. You understand, therefore, I have a
      false complexion. Now to business.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If your ladyship insists on calling it business. I have little to offer—myself!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have a gentlemanly residence.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is, my lady, it is. It is a bijou.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ Lady Camper sighed dejectedly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is a perfect bijou!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oblige me, General, by not pronouncing the French word as if you were
      swearing by something in English, like a trooper.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople started, admitted that the word was French, and apologized
      for his pronunciation. Her variability was now visible over a corner of
      the battlefield like a thunder-cloud.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The business we have to discuss concerns the young people, General.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ brightened by this, he assented: ‘Yes, dear Lady Camper; it is a
      part of the business; it is a secondary part; it has to be discussed; I
      say I subscribe beforehand. I may say, that honouring, esteeming you as I
      do, and hoping ardently for your consent....
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They must have a home and an income, General.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I presume, dearest lady, that Elizabeth will be welcome in your home. I
      certainly shall never chase Reginald out of mine.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper threw back her head. ‘Then you are not yet awake, or you
      practice the art of sleeping with open eyes! Now listen to me. I rouge, I
      have told you. I like colour, and I do not like to see wrinkles or have
      them seen. Therefore I rouge. I do not expect to deceive the world so
      flagrantly as to my age, and you I would not deceive for a moment. I am
      seventy.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The effect of this noble frankness on the General, was to raise him from
      his chair in a sitting posture as if he had been blown up.
    </p>
<p>
      Her countenance was inexorably imperturbable under his alternate blinking
      and gazing that drew her close and shot her distant, like a mysterious
      toy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But,’ said she, ‘I am an artist; I dislike the look of extreme age, so I
      conceal it as well as I can. You are very kind to fall in with the
      deception: an innocent and, I think, a proper one, before the world,
      though not to the gentleman who does me the honour to propose to me for my
      hand. You desire to settle our business first. You esteem me; I suppose
      you mean as much as young people mean when they say they love. Do you? Let
      us come to an understanding.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can,’ the melancholy General gasped, ‘I say I can—I cannot—I
      cannot credit your ladyship’s...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are at liberty to call me Angela.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ange...’ he tried it, and in shame relapsed. ‘Madam, yes. Thanks.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah,’ cried Lady Camper, ‘do not use these vulgar contractions of decent
      speech in my presence. I abhor the word “thanks.” It is fit for fribbles.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dear me, I have used it all my life,’ groaned the General.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, for the remainder, be it understood that you renounce it. To
      continue, my age is...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, impossible, impossible,’ the General almost wailed; there was really
      a crack in his voice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Advancing to seventy. But, like you, I am happy to say I have not a
      malady. I bring no invalid frame to a union that necessitates the leaving
      of the front door open day and night to the doctor. My belief is, I could
      follow my husband still on a campaign, if he were a warrior instead of a
      pensioner.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople winced.
    </p>
<p>
      He was about to say humbly, ‘As General of Brigade...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, yes, you want a commanding officer, and that I have seen, and that
      has caused me to meditate on your proposal,’ she interrupted him; while
      he, studying her countenance hard, with the painful aspect of a youth who
      lashes a donkey memory in an examination by word of mouth, attempted to
      marshal her signs of younger years against her awful confession of the
      extremely ancient, the witheringly ancient. But for the manifest rouge,
      manifest in spite of her declaration that she had not yet that morning
      proceeded to her paintbrush, he would have thrown down his glove to
      challenge her on the subject of her age. She had actually charms. Her
      mouth had a charm; her eyes were lively; her figure, mature if you like,
      was at least full and good; she stood upright, she had a queenly seat. His
      mental ejaculation was, ‘What a wonderful constitution!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      By a lapse of politeness, he repeated it to himself half aloud; he was
      shockingly nervous.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, I have finer health than many a younger woman,’ she said. ‘An
      ordinary calculation would give me twenty good years to come. I am a
      widow, as you know. And, by the way, you have a leaning for widows. Have
      you not? I thought I had heard of a widow Barcop in this parish. Do not
      protest. I assure you I am a stranger to jealousy. My income...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General raised his hands.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, then,’ said the cool and self-contained lady, ‘before I go farther,
      I may ask you, knowing what you have forced me to confess, are you still
      of the same mind as to marriage? And one moment, General. I promise you
      most sincerely that your withdrawing a step shall not, as far as it
      touches me, affect my neighbourly and friendly sentiments; not in any
      degree. Shall we be as we were?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper extended her delicate hand to him.
    </p>
<p>
      He took it respectfully, inspected the aristocratic and unshrunken
      fingers, and kissing them, said, ‘I never withdraw from a position, unless
      I am beaten back. Lady Camper, I...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My name is Angela.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General tried again: he could not utter the name.
    </p>
<p>
      To call a lady of seventy Angela is difficult in itself. It is, it seems,
      thrice difficult in the way of courtship.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Angela!’ said she.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes. I say, there is not a more beautiful female name, dear Lady Camper.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Spare me that word “female” as long as you live. Address me by that name,
      if you please.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General smiled. The smile was meant for propitiation and sweetness. It
      became a brazen smile.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Unless you wish to step back,’ said she.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Indeed, no. I am happy, Lady Camper. My life is yours. I say, my life is
      devoted to you, dear madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Angela!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople was blushingly delivered of the name.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That will do,’ said she. ‘And as I think it possible one may be admired
      too much as an artist, I must request you to keep my number of years a
      secret.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To the death, madam,’ said the General.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now we will take a turn in the garden, Wilson Ople. And beware of one
      thing, for a commencement, for you are full of weeds, and I mean to pluck
      out a few: never call any place a gentlemanly residence in my hearing, nor
      let it come to my ears that you have been using the phrase elsewhere.
      Don’t express astonishment. At present it is enough that I dislike it. But
      this only,’ Lady Camper added, ‘this only if it is not your intention to
      withdraw from your position.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Madam, my lady, I was saying—hem!—Angela, I could not wish to
      withdraw.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper leaned with some pressure on his arm, observing, ‘You have a
      curious attachment to antiquities.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear lady, it is your mind; I say, it is your mind: I was saying, I am
      in love with your mind,’ the General endeavoured to assure her, and
      himself too.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Or is it my powers as an artist?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your mind, your extraordinary powers of mind.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said Lady Camper, ‘a veteran General of Brigade is as good a
      crutch as a childless old grannam can have.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And as a crutch, General Ople, parading her grounds with the aged woman,
      found himself used and treated.
    </p>
<p>
      The accuracy of his perceptions might be questioned. He was like a man
      stunned by some great tropical fruit, which responds to the longing of his
      eyes by falling on his head; but it appeared to him, that she increased in
      bitterness at every step they took, as if determined to make him realize
      her wrinkles.
    </p>
<p>
      He was even so inconsequent, or so little recognized his position, as to
      object in his heart to hear himself called Wilson.
    </p>
<p>
      It is true that she uttered Wilsonople as if the names formed one word.
      And on a second occasion (when he inclined to feel hurt) she remarked, ‘I
      fear me, Wilsonople, if we are to speak plainly, thou art but a fool.’ He,
      perhaps, naturally objected to that. He was, however, giddy, and barely
      knew.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet once more the magical woman changed. All semblance of harshness, and
      harridan-like spike-tonguedness vanished when she said adieu.
    </p>
<p>
      The astronomer, looking at the crusty jag and scoria of the magnified moon
      through his telescope, and again with naked eyes at the soft-beaming moon,
      when the crater-ridges are faint as eyebrow-pencillings, has a similar
      sharp alternation of prospect to that which mystified General Ople.
    </p>
<p>
      But between watching an orb that is only variable at our caprice, and
      contemplating a woman who shifts and quivers ever with her own, how vast
      the difference!
    </p>
<p>
      And consider that this woman is about to be one’s wife! He could have
      believed (if he had not known full surely that such things are not) he was
      in the hands of a witch.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper’s ‘adieu’ was perfectly beautiful—a kind, cordial,
      intimate, above all, to satisfy his present craving, it was a lady-like
      adieu—the adieu of a delicate and elegant woman, who had hardly left
      her anchorage by forty to sail into the fifties.
    </p>
<p>
      Alas! he had her word for it, that she was not less than seventy. And,
      worse, she had betrayed most melancholy signs of sourness and agedness as
      soon as he had sworn himself to her fast and fixed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The road is open to you to retreat,’ were her last words.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My road,’ he answered gallantly, ‘is forward.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He was drawing backward as he said it, and something provoked her to
      smile.
    </p>
<p>

<h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
<p>
      It is a noble thing to say that your road is forward, and it befits a man
      of battles. General Ople was too loyal a gentleman to think of any other
      road. Still, albeit not gifted with imagination, he could not avoid the
      feeling that he had set his face to Winter. He found himself suddenly
      walking straight into the heart of Winter, and a nipping Winter. For her
      ladyship had proved acutely nipping. His little customary phrases, to
      which Lady Camper objected, he could see no harm in whatever. Conversing
      with her in the privacy of domestic life would never be the flowing
      business that it is for other men. It would demand perpetual vigilance,
      hop, skip, jump, flounderings, and apologies.
    </p>
<p>
      This was not a pleasing prospect.
    </p>
<p>
      On the other hand, she was the niece of an earl. She was wealthy. She
      might be an excellent friend to Elizabeth; and she could be, when she
      liked, both commandingly and bewitchingly ladylike.
    </p>
<p>
      Good! But he was a General Officer of not more than fifty-five, in his
      full vigour, and she a woman of seventy!
    </p>
<p>
      The prospect was bleak. It resembled an outlook on the steppes. In point
      of the discipline he was to expect, he might be compared to a raw recruit,
      and in his own home!
    </p>
<p>
      However, she was a woman of mind. One would be proud of her.
    </p>
<p>
      But did he know the worst of her? A dreadful presentiment, that he did not
      know the worst of her, rolled an ocean of gloom upon General Ople,
      striking out one solitary thought in the obscurity, namely, that he was
      about to receive punishment for retiring from active service to a life of
      ease at a comparatively early age, when still in marching trim. And the
      shadow of the thought was, that he deserved the punishment!
    </p>
<p>
      He was in his garden with the dawn. Hard exercise is the best of opiates
      for dismal reflections. The General discomposed his daughter by offering
      to accompany her on her morning ride before breakfast. She considered that
      it would fatigue him. ‘I am not a man of eighty!’ he cried. He could have
      wished he had been.
    </p>
<p>
      He led the way to the park, where they soon had sight of young Rolles, who
      checked his horse and spied them like a vedette, but, perceiving that he
      had been seen, came cantering, and hailing the General with hearty
      wonderment.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And what’s this the world says, General?’ said he. ‘But we all applaud
      your taste. My aunt Angela was the handsomest woman of her time.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General murmured in confusion, ‘Dear me!’ and looked at the young man,
      thinking that he could not have known the time.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is all arranged, my dear General?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing is arranged, and I beg—I say I beg... I came out for fresh
      air and pace.’..
    </p>
<p>
      The General rode frantically.
    </p>
<p>
      In spite of the fresh air, he was unable to eat at breakfast. He was
      bound, of course, to present himself to Lady Camper, in common civility,
      immediately after it.
    </p>
<p>
      And first, what were the phrases he had to avoid uttering in her presence?
      He could remember only the ‘gentlemanly residence.’ And it was a
      gentlemanly residence, he thought as he took leave of it. It was one,
      neatly named to fit the place. Lady Camper is indeed a most eccentric
      person! he decided from his experience of her.
    </p>
<p>
      He was rather astonished that young Rolles should have spoken so coolly of
      his aunt’s leaning to matrimony; but perhaps her exact age was unknown to
      the younger members of her family.
    </p>
<p>
      This idea refreshed him by suggesting the extremely honourable nature of
      Lady Camper’s uncomfortable confession.
    </p>
<p>
      He himself had an uncomfortable confession to make. He would have to speak
      of his income. He was living up to the edges of it.
    </p>
<p>
      She is an upright woman, and I must be the same! he said, fortunately not
      in her hearing.
    </p>
<p>
      The subject was disagreeable to a man sensitive on the topic of money, and
      feeling that his prudence had recently been misled to keep up appearances.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper was in her garden, reclining under her parasol. A chair was
      beside her, to which, acknowledging the salutation of her suitor, she
      waved him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have met my nephew Reginald this morning, General?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Curiously, in the park, this morning, before breakfast, I did, yes. Hem!
      I, I say I did meet him. Has your ladyship seen him?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No. The park is very pretty in the early morning.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sweetly pretty.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper raised her head, and with the mildness of assured
      dictatorship, pronounced: ‘Never say that before me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I submit, my lady,’ said the poor scourged man.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, naturally you do. Vulgar phrases have to be endured, except when our
      intimates are guilty, and then we are not merely offended, we are
      compromised by them. You are still of the mind in which you left me
      yesterday? You are one day older. But I warn you, so am I.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, my lady, we cannot, I say we cannot check time. Decidedly of the
      same mind. Quite so.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oblige me by never saying “Quite so.” My lawyer says it. It reeks of the
      City of London. And do not look so miserable.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I, madam? my dear lady!’ the General flashed out in a radiance that
      dulled instantly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said she cheerfully, ‘and you’re for the old woman?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For Lady Camper.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are seductive in your flatteries, General. Well, then, we have to
      speak of business.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My affairs——’ General Ople was beginning, with perturbed
      forehead; but Lady Camper held up her finger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We will touch on your affairs incidentally. Now listen to me, and do not
      exclaim until I have finished. You know that these two young ones have
      been whispering over the wall for some months. They have been meeting on
      the river and in the park habitually, apparently with your consent.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My lady!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I did not say with your connivance.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You mean my daughter Elizabeth?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And my nephew Reginald. We have named them, if that advances us. Now, the
      end of such meetings is marriage, and the sooner the better, if they are
      to continue. I would rather they should not; I do not hold it good for
      young soldiers to marry. But if they do, it is very certain that their pay
      will not support a family; and in a marriage of two healthy young people,
      we have to assume the existence of the family. You have allowed matters to
      go so far that the boy is hot in love; I suppose the girl is, too. She is
      a nice girl. I do not object to her personally. But I insist that a
      settlement be made on her before I give my nephew one penny. Hear me out,
      for I am not fond of business, and shall be glad to have done with these
      explanations. Reginald has nothing of his own. He is my sister’s son, and
      I loved her, and rather like the boy. He has at present four hundred a
      year from me. I will double it, on the condition that you at once make
      over ten thousand—not less; and let it be yes or no!—to be
      settled on your daughter and go to her children, independent of the
      husband—cela va sans dire. Now you may speak, General.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General spoke, with breath fetched from the deeps:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ten thousand pounds! Hem! Ten! Hem, frankly—ten, my lady! One’s
      income—I am quite taken by surprise. I say Elizabeth’s conduct—though,
      poor child! it is natural to her to seek a mate, I mean, to accept a mate
      and an establishment, and Reginald is a very hopeful fellow—I was
      saying, they jump on me out of an ambush, and I wish them every happiness.
      And she is an ardent soldier, and a soldier she must marry. But ten
      thousand!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is to secure the happiness of your daughter, General.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pounds! my lady. It would rather cripple me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You would have my house, General; you would have the moiety, as the
      lawyers say, of my purse; you would have horses, carriages, servants; I do
      not divine what more you would wish to have.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But, madam—a pensioner on the Government! I can look back on past
      services, I say old services, and I accept my position. But, madam, a
      pensioner on my wife, bringing next to nothing to the common estate! I
      fear my self-respect would, I say would...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, and what would it do, General Ople?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I was saying, my self-respect as my wife’s pensioner, my lady. I could
      not come to her empty-handed.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you expect that I should be the person to settle money on your
      daughter, to save her from mischances? A rakish husband, for example; for
      Reginald is young, and no one can guess what will be made of him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Undoubtedly your ladyship is correct. We might try absence for the poor
      girl. I have no female relation, but I could send her to the sea-side to a
      lady-friend.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘General Ople, I forbid you, as you value my esteem, ever—and I
      repeat, I forbid you ever—to afflict my ears with that phrase,
      “lady-friend!”’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General blinked in a state of insurgent humility.
    </p>
<p>
      These incessant whippings could not but sting the humblest of men; and
      ‘lady-friend,’ he was sure, was a very common term, used, he was sure, in
      the very best society. He had never heard Her Majesty speak at levees of a
      lady-friend, but he was quite sure that she had one; and if so, what could
      be the objection to her subjects mentioning it as a term to suit their own
      circumstances?
    </p>
<p>
      He was harassed and perplexed by old Lady Camper’s treatment of him, and
      he resolved not to call her Angela even upon supplication—not that
      day, at least.
    </p>
<p>
      She said, ‘You will not need to bring property of any kind to the common
      estate; I neither look for it nor desire it. The generous thing for you to
      do would be to give your daughter all you have, and come to me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But, Lady Camper, if I denude myself or curtail my income—a man at
      his wife’s discretion, I was saying a man at his wife’s mercy...!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople was really forced, by his manly dignity, to make this protest
      on its behalf. He did not see how he could have escaped doing so; he was
      more an agent than a principal. ‘My wife’s mercy,’ he said again, but
      simply as a herald proclaiming superior orders.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper’s brows were wrathful. A deep blood-crimson overcame the
      rouge, and gave her a terrible stormy look.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The congress now ceases to sit, and the treaty is not concluded,’ was all
      she said.
    </p>
<p>
      She rose, bowed to him, ‘Good morning, General,’ and turned her back.
    </p>
<p>
      He sighed. He was a free man. But this could not be denied—whatever
      the lady’s age, she was a grand woman in her carriage, and when looking
      angry, she had a queenlike aspect that raised her out of the reckoning of
      time.
    </p>
<p>
      So now he knew there was a worse behind what he had previously known. He
      was precipitate in calling it the worst. ‘Now,’ said he to himself, ‘I
      know the worst!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      No man should ever say it. Least of all, one who has entered into
      relations with an eccentric lady.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<p>
      Politeness required that General Ople should not appear to rejoice in his
      dismissal as a suitor, and should at least make some show of holding
      himself at the beck of a reconsidering mind. He was guilty of running up
      to London early next day, and remaining absent until nightfall; and he did
      the same on the two following days. When he presented himself at Lady
      Camper’s lodge-gates, the astonishing intelligence, that her ladyship had
      departed for the Continent and Egypt gave him qualms of remorse, which
      assumed a more definite shape in something like awe of her triumphant
      constitution. He forbore to mention her age, for he was the most
      honourable of men, but a habit of tea-table talkativeness impelled him to
      say and repeat an idea that had visited him, to the effect, that Lady
      Camper was one of those wonderful women who are comparable to brilliant
      generals, and defend themselves from the siege of Time by various
      aggressive movements. Fearful of not being understood, owing to the rarity
      of the occasions when the squat plain squad of honest Saxon regulars at
      his command were called upon to explain an idea, he re-cast the sentence.
      But, as it happened that the regulars of his vocabulary were not numerous,
      and not accustomed to work upon thoughts and images, his repetitions
      rather succeeded in exposing the piece of knowledge he had recently
      acquired than in making his meaning plainer. So we need not marvel that
      his acquaintances should suppose him to be secretly aware of an extreme
      degree in which Lady Camper was a veteran.
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople entered into the gaieties of the neighbourhood once more, and
      passed through the Winter cheerfully. In justice to him, however, it
      should be said that to the intent dwelling of his mind upon Lady Camper,
      and not to the festive life he led, was due his entire ignorance of his
      daughter’s unhappiness. She lived with him, and yet it was in other houses
      he learnt that she was unhappy. After his last interview with Lady Camper,
      he had informed Elizabeth of the ruinous and preposterous amount of money
      demanded of him for a settlement upon her and Elizabeth, like the girl of
      good sense that she was, had replied immediately, ‘It could not be thought
      of, papa.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He had spoken to Reginald likewise. The young man fell into a dramatic
      tearing-of-hair and long-stride fury, not ill becoming an enamoured
      dragoon. But he maintained that his aunt, though an eccentric, was a
      cordially kind woman. He seemed to feel, if he did not partly hint, that
      the General might have accepted Lady Camper’s terms. The young officer
      could no longer be welcome at Douro Lodge, so the General paid him a
      morning call at his quarters, and was distressed to find him breakfasting
      very late, tapping eggs that he forgot to open—one of the surest
      signs of a young man downright and deep in love, as the General knew from
      experience—and surrounded by uncut sporting journals of past weeks,
      which dated from the day when his blow had struck him, as accurately as
      the watch of the drowned man marks his minute. Lady Camper had gone to
      Italy, and was in communication with her nephew: Reginald was not further
      explicit. His legs were very prominent in his despair, and his fingers
      frequently performed the part of blunt combs; consequently the General was
      impressed by his passion for Elizabeth. The girl who, if she was often
      meditative, always met his eyes with a smile, and quietly said ‘Yes,
      papa,’ and ‘No, papa,’ gave him little concern as to the state of her
      feelings. Yet everybody said now that she was unhappy. Mrs. Barcop, the
      widow, raised her voice above the rest. So attentive was she to Elizabeth
      that the General had it kindly suggested to him, that some one was
      courting him through his daughter. He gazed at the widow. Now she was not
      much past thirty; and it was really singular—he could have laughed—thinking
      of Mrs. Barcop set him persistently thinking of Lady Camper. That is to
      say, his mad fancy reverted from the lady of perhaps thirty-five to the
      lady of seventy.
    </p>
<p>
      Such, thought he, is genius in a woman! Of his neighbours generally, Mrs.
      Baerens, the wife of a German merchant, an exquisite player on the
      pianoforte, was the most inclined to lead him to speak of Lady Camper. She
      was a kind prattling woman, and was known to have been a governess before
      her charms withdrew the gastronomic Gottfried Baerens from his devotion to
      the well-served City club, where, as he exclaimed (ever turning fondly to
      his wife as he vocalized the compliment), he had found every necessity,
      every luxury, in life, ‘as you cannot have dem out of London—all
      save de female!’ Mrs. Baerens, a lady of Teutonic extraction, was
      distinguishable as of that sex; at least, she was not masculine. She spoke
      with great respect of Lady Camper and her family, and seemed to agree in
      the General’s eulogies of Lady Camper’s constitution. Still he thought she
      eyed him strangely.
    </p>
<p>
      One April morning the General received a letter with the Italian postmark.
      Opening it with his usual calm and happy curiosity, he perceived that it
      was composed of pen-and-ink drawings. And suddenly his heart sank like a
      scuttled ship. He saw himself the victim of a caricature.
    </p>
<p>
      The first sketch had merely seemed picturesque, and he supposed it a
      clever play of fancy by some travelling friend, or perhaps an actual scene
      slightly exaggerated. Even on reading, ‘A distant view of the city of
      Wilsonople,’ he was only slightly enlightened. His heart beat still with
      befitting regularity. But the second and the third sketches betrayed the
      terrible hand. The distant view of the city of Wilsonople was fair with
      glittering domes, which, in the succeeding near view, proved to have been
      soap-bubbles, for a place of extreme flatness, begirt with crazy
      old-fashioned fortifications, was shown; and in the third view,
      representing the interior, stood for sole place of habitation, a
      sentry-box.
    </p>
<p>
      Most minutely drawn, and, alas! with fearful accuracy, a military
      gentleman in undress occupied the box. Not a doubt could exist as to the
      person it was meant to be.
    </p>
<p>
      The General tried hard to remain incredulous. He remembered too well who
      had called him Wilsonople.
    </p>
<p>
      But here was the extraordinary thing that sent him over the neighbourhood
      canvassing for exclamations: on the fourth page was the outline of a
      lovely feminine hand, holding a pen, as in the act of shading, and under
      it these words: ‘What I say is, I say I think it exceedingly unladylike.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Now consider the General’s feelings when, turning to this fourth page,
      having these very words in his mouth, as the accurate expression of his
      thoughts, he discovered them written!
    </p>
<p>
      An enemy who anticipates the actions of our mind, has a quality of the
      malignant divine that may well inspire terror. The senses of General Ople
      were struck by the aspect of a lurid Goddess, who penetrated him, read him
      through, and had both power and will to expose and make him ridiculous for
      ever.
    </p>
<p>
      The loveliness of the hand, too, in a perplexing manner contested his
      denunciation of her conduct. It was ladylike eminently, and it involved
      him in a confused mixture of the moral and material, as great as young
      people are known to feel when they make the attempt to separate them, in
      one of their frenzies.
    </p>
<p>
      With a petty bitter laugh he folded the letter, put it in his
      breast-pocket, and sallied forth for a walk, chiefly to talk to himself
      about it. But as it absorbed him entirely, he showed it to the rector,
      whom he met, and what the rector said is of no consequence, for General
      Ople listened to no remarks, calling in succession on the Pollingtons, the
      Goslings, the Baerens, and others, early though it was, and the lords of
      those houses absent amassing hoards; and to the ladies everywhere he
      displayed the sketches he had received, observing, that Wilsonople meant
      himself; and there he was, he said, pointing at the capped fellow in the
      sentry-box, done unmistakably. The likeness indeed was remarkable. ‘She is
      a woman of genius,’ he ejaculated, with utter melancholy. Mrs. Baerens, by
      the aid of a magnifying glass, assisted him to read a line under the
      sentry-box, that he had taken for a mere trembling dash; it ran, A
      gentlemanly residence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What eyes she has!’ the General exclaimed; ‘I say it is miraculous what
      eyes she has at her time of... I was saying, I should never have known it
      was writing.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He sighed heavily. His shuddering sensitiveness to caricature was
      increased by a certain evident dread of the hand which struck; the knowing
      that he was absolutely bare to this woman, defenceless, open to exposure
      in his little whims, foibles, tricks, incompetencies, in what lay in his
      heart, and the words that would come to his tongue. He felt like a man
      haunted.
    </p>
<p>
      So deeply did he feel the blow, that people asked how it was that he could
      be so foolish as to dance about assisting Lady Camper in her efforts to
      make him ridiculous; he acted the parts of publisher and agent for the
      fearful caricaturist. In truth, there was a strangely double reason for
      his conduct; he danced about for sympathy, he had the intensest craving
      for sympathy, but more than this, or quite as much, he desired to have the
      powers of his enemy widely appreciated; in the first place, that he might
      be excused to himself for wincing under them, and secondly, because an
      awful admiration of her, that should be deepened by a corresponding
      sentiment around him, helped him to enjoy luxurious recollections of an
      hour when he was near making her his own—his own, in the holy
      abstract contemplation of marriage, without realizing their probable
      relative conditions after the ceremony.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I say, that is the very image of her ladyship’s hand,’ he was especially
      fond of remarking, ‘I say it is a beautiful hand.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He carried the letter in his pocket-book; and beginning to fancy that she
      had done her worst, for he could not imagine an inventive malignity
      capable of pursuing the theme, he spoke of her treatment of him with
      compassionate regret, not badly assumed from being partly sincere.
    </p>
<p>
      Two letters dated in France, the one Dijon, the other Fontainebleau,
      arrived together; and as the General knew Lady Camper to be returning to
      England, he expected that she was anxious to excuse herself to him. His
      fingers were not so confident, for he tore one of the letters to open it.
    </p>
<p>
      The City of Wilsonople was recognizable immediately. So likewise was the
      sole inhabitant.
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople’s petty bitter laugh recurred, like a weak-chested patient’s
      cough in the shifting of our winds eastward.
    </p>
<p>
      A faceless woman’s shadow kneels on the ground near the sentry-box,
      weeping. A faceless shadow of a young man on horseback is beheld galloping
      toward a gulf. The sole inhabitant contemplates his largely substantial
      full fleshed face and figure in a glass.
    </p>
<p>
      Next, we see the standard of Great Britain furled; next, unfurled and
      borne by a troop of shadows to the sentry-box. The officer within says, ‘I
      say I should be very happy to carry it, but I cannot quit this gentlemanly
      residence.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Next, the standard is shown assailed by popguns. Several of the shadows
      are prostrate. ‘I was saying, I assure you that nothing but this
      gentlemanly residence prevents me from heading you,’ says the gallant
      officer.
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople trembled with protestant indignation when he saw himself
      reclining in a magnified sentry-box, while detachments of shadows hurry to
      him to show him the standard of his country trailing in the dust; and he
      is maliciously made to say, ‘I dislike responsibility. I say I am a
      fervent patriot, and very fond of my comforts, but I shun responsibility.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The second letter contained scenes between Wilsonople and the Moon.
    </p>
<p>
      He addresses her as his neighbour, and tells her of his triumphs over the
      sex.
    </p>
<p>
      He requests her to inform him whether she is a ‘female,’ that she may be
      triumphed over.
    </p>
<p>
      He hastens past her window on foot, with his head bent, just as the
      General had been in the habit of walking.
    </p>
<p>
      He drives a mouse-pony furiously by.
    </p>
<p>
      He cuts down a tree, that she may peep through.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, from the Moon’s point of view, Wilsonople, a Silenus, is discerned
      in an arm-chair winking at a couple too plainly pouting their lips for a
      doubt of their intentions to be entertained.
    </p>
<p>
      A fourth letter arrived, bearing date of Paris. This one illustrated
      Wilsonople’s courtship of the Moon, and ended with his ‘saying,’ in his
      peculiar manner, ‘In spite of her paint I could not have conceived her age
      to be so enormous.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      How break off his engagement with the Lady Moon? Consent to none of her
      terms!
    </p>
<p>
      Little used as he was to read behind a veil, acuteness of suffering
      sharpened the General’s intelligence to a degree that sustained him in
      animated dialogue with each succeeding sketch, or poisoned arrow whirring
      at him from the moment his eyes rested on it; and here are a few samples:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Wilsonople informs the Moon that she is “sweetly pretty.”
     </p>
<p>
      ‘He thanks her with “thanks” for a handsome piece of lunar green cheese.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He points to her, apparently telling some one, “my lady-friend.”
     </p>
<p>
      ‘He sneezes “Bijou! bijou! bijou!”’ 
    </p>
<p>
      They were trifles, but they attacked his habits of speech; and he began to
      grow more and more alarmingly absurd in each fresh caricature of his
      person.
    </p>
<p>
      He looked at himself as the malicious woman’s hand had shaped him. It was
      unjust; it was no resemblance—and yet it was! There was a corner of
      likeness left that leavened the lump; henceforth he must walk abroad with
      this distressing image of himself before his eyes, instead of the
      satisfactory reflex of the man who had, and was happy in thinking that he
      had, done mischief in his time. Such an end for a conquering man was too
      pathetic.
    </p>
<p>
      The General surprised himself talking to himself in something louder than
      a hum at neighbours’ dinner-tables. He looked about and noticed that
      people were silently watching him.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
<p>
      Lady Camper’s return was the subject of speculation in the neighbourhood,
      for most people thought she would cease to persecute the General with her
      preposterous and unwarrantable pen-and-ink sketches when living so closely
      proximate; and how he would behave was the question. Those who made a hero
      of him were sure he would treat her with disdain. Others were uncertain.
      He had been so severely hit that it seemed possible he would not show much
      spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      He, for his part, had come to entertain such dread of the post, that Lady
      Camper’s return relieved him of his morning apprehensions; and he would
      have forgiven her, though he feared to see her, if only she had promised
      to leave him in peace for the future. He feared to see her, because of the
      too probable furnishing of fresh matter for her ladyship’s hand. Of course
      he could not avoid being seen by her, and that was a particular misery. A
      gentlemanly humility, or demureness of aspect, when seen, would, he hoped,
      disarm his enemy. It should, he thought. He had borne unheard-of things.
      No one of his friends and acquaintances knew, they could not know, what he
      had endured. It has caused him fits of stammering. It had destroyed the
      composure of his gait. Elizabeth had informed him that he talked to
      himself incessantly, and aloud. She, poor child, looked pale too. She was
      evidently anxious about him.
    </p>
<p>
      Young Rolles, whom he had met now and then, persisted in praising his
      aunt’s good heart. So, perhaps, having satiated her revenge, she might now
      be inclined for peace, on the terms of distant civility.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes! poor Elizabeth!’ sighed the General, in pity of the poor girl’s
      disappointment; ‘poor Elizabeth! she little guesses what her father has
      gone through. Poor child! I say, she hasn’t an idea of my sufferings.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople delivered his card at Lady Camper’s lodgegates and escaped to
      his residence in a state of prickly heat that required the brushing of his
      hair with hard brushes for several minutes to comfort and re-establish
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      He had fallen to working in his garden, when Lady Camper’s card was
      brought to him an hour after the delivery of his own; a pleasing
      promptitude, showing signs of repentance, and suggesting to the General
      instantly some sharp sarcasms upon women, which he had come upon in
      quotations in the papers and the pulpit, his two main sources of
      information.
    </p>
<p>
      Instead of handing back the card to the maid, he stuck it in his hat and
      went on digging.
    </p>
<p>
      The first of a series of letters containing shameless realistic
      caricatures was handed to him the afternoon following. They came fast and
      thick. Not a day’s interval of grace was allowed. Niobe under the shafts
      of Diana was hardly less violently and mortally assailed. The deadliness
      of the attack lay in the ridicule of the daily habits of one of the most
      sensitive of men, as to his personal appearance, and the opinion of the
      world. He might have concealed the sketches, but he could not have
      concealed the bruises, and people were perpetually asking the unhappy
      General what he was saying, for he spoke to himself as if he were
      repeating something to them for the tenth time.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I say,’ said he, ‘I say that for a lady, really an educated lady, to sit,
      as she must—I was saying, she must have sat in an attic to have the
      right view of me. And there you see—this is what she has done. This
      is the last, this is the afternoon’s delivery. Her ladyship has me
      correctly as to costume, but I could not exhibit such a sketch to ladies.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A back view of the General was displayed in his act of digging.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I say I could not allow ladies to see it,’ he informed the gentlemen, who
      were suffered to inspect it freely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you see, I have no means of escape; I am at her mercy from morning to
      night,’ the General said, with a quivering tongue, ‘unless I stay at home
      inside the house; and that is death to me, or unless I abandon the place,
      and my lease; and I shall—I say, I shall find nowhere in England for
      anything like the money or conveniences such a gent—a residence you
      would call fit for a gentleman. I call it a bi... it is, in short, a gem.
      But I shall have to go.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Young Rolles offered to expostulate with his aunt Angela.
    </p>
<p>
      The General said, ‘Tha... I thank you very much. I would not have her
      ladyship suppose I am so susceptible. I hardly know,’ he confessed
      pitiably, ‘what it is right to say, and what not—what not. I-I-I
      never know when I am not looking a fool. I hurry from tree to tree to shun
      the light. I am seriously affected in my appetite. I say, I shall have to
      go.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Reginald gave him to understand that if he flew, the shafts would follow
      him, for Lady Camper would never forgive his running away, and was quite
      equal to publishing a book of the adventures of Wilsonople.
    </p>
<p>
      Sunday afternoon, walking in the park with his daughter on his arm,
      General Ople met Mr. Rolles. He saw that the young man and Elizabeth were
      mortally pale, and as the very idea of wretchedness directed his attention
      to himself, he addressed them conjointly on the subject of his
      persecution, giving neither of them a chance of speaking until they were
      constrained to part.
    </p>
<p>
      A sketch was the consequence, in which a withered Cupid and a fading
      Psyche were seen divided by Wilsonople, who keeps them forcibly asunder
      with policeman’s fists, while courteously and elegantly entreating them to
      hear him. ‘Meet,’ he tells them, ‘as often as you like, in my company, so
      long as you listen to me’; and the pathos of his aspect makes hungry
      demand for a sympathetic audience.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, this, and not the series representing the martyrdom of the old couple
      at Douro Lodge Gates, whose rigid frames bore witness to the close packing
      of a gentlemanly residence, this was the sketch General Ople, in his
      madness from the pursuing bite of the gadfly, handed about at Mrs.
      Pollington’s lawn-party. Some have said, that he should not have betrayed
      his daughter; but it is reasonable to suppose he had no idea of his
      daughter’s being the Psyche. Or if he had, it was indistinct, owing to the
      violence of his personal emotion. Assuming this to have been the very
      sketch; he handed it to two or three ladies in turn, and was heard to
      deliver himself at intervals in the following snatches: ‘As you like, my
      lady, as you like; strike, I say strike; I bear it; I say I bear it. ...
      If her ladyship is unforgiving, I say I am enduring.... I may go, I was
      saying I may go mad, but while I have my reason I walk upright, I walk
      upright.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Pollington and certain City gentlemen hearing the poor General’s
      renewed soliloquies, were seized with disgust of Lady Camper’s conduct,
      and stoutly advised an application to the Law Courts.
    </p>
<p>
      He gave ear to them abstractedly, but after pulling out the whole chapter
      of the caricatures (which it seemed that he kept in a case of morocco
      leather in his breast-pocket), showing them, with comments on them, and
      observing, ‘There will be more, there must be more, I say I am sure there
      are things I do that her ladyship will discover and expose,’ he declined
      to seek redress or simple protection; and the miserable spectacle was
      exhibited soon after of this courtly man listening to Mrs. Barcop on the
      weather, and replying in acquiescence: ‘It is hot.—If your ladyship
      will only abstain from colours. Very hot as you say, madam,—I do not
      complain of pen and ink, but I would rather escape colours. And I dare say
      you find it hot too?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Barcop shut her eyes and sighed over the wreck of a handsome military
      officer.
    </p>
<p>
      She asked him: ‘What is your objection to colours?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      His hand was at his breast-pocket immediately, as he said: ‘Have you not
      seen?’—though but a few minutes back he had shown her the contents
      of the packet, including a hurried glance of the famous digging scene.
    </p>
<p>
      By this time the entire district was in fervid sympathy with General Ople.
      The ladies did not, as their lords did, proclaim astonishment that a man
      should suffer a woman to goad him to a state of semi-lunacy; but one or
      two confessed to their husbands, that it required a great admiration of
      General Ople not to despise him, both for his susceptibility and his
      patience. As for the men, they knew him to have faced the balls in
      bellowing battle-strife; they knew him to have endured privation, not only
      cold but downright want of food and drink—an almost unimaginable
      horror to these brave daily feasters; so they could not quite look on him
      in contempt; but his want of sense was offensive, and still more so his
      submission to a scourging by a woman. Not one of them would have deigned
      to feel it. Would they have allowed her to see that she could sting them?
      They would have laughed at her. Or they would have dragged her before a
      magistrate.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a Sunday in early Summer when General Ople walked to morning
      service, unaccompanied by Elizabeth, who was unwell. The church was of the
      considerate old-fashioned order, with deaf square pews, permitting the
      mind to abstract itself from the sermon, or wrestle at leisure with the
      difficulties presented by the preacher, as General Ople often did, feeling
      not a little in love with his sincere attentiveness for grappling with the
      knotty point and partially allowing the struggle to be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      The Church was, besides, a sanctuary for him. Hither his enemy did not
      come. He had this one place of refuge, and he almost looked a happy man
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      He had passed into his hat and out of it, which he habitually did
      standing, when who should walk up to within a couple of yards of him but
      Lady Camper. Her pew was full of poor people, who made signs of retiring.
      She signified to them that they were to sit, then quietly took her seat
      among them, fronting the General across the aisle.
    </p>
<p>
      During the sermon a low voice, sharp in contradistinction to the monotone
      of the preacher’s, was heard to repeat these words: ‘I say I am not sure I
      shall survive it.’ Considerable muttering in the same quarter was heard
      besides.
    </p>
<p>
      After the customary ceremonious game, when all were free to move, of
      nobody liking to move first, Lady Camper and a charity boy were the
      persons who took the lead. But Lady Camper could not quit her pew, owing
      to the sticking of the door. She smiled as with her pretty hand she twice
      or thrice essayed to shake it open. General Ople strode to her aid. He
      pulled the door, gave the shadow of a respectful bow, and no doubt he
      would have withdrawn, had not Lady Camper, while acknowledging the
      civility, placed her prayer-book in his hands to carry at her heels. There
      was no choice for him. He made a sort of slipping dance back for his hat,
      and followed her ladyship. All present being eager to witness the
      spectacle, the passage of Lady Camper dragging the victim General behind
      her was observed without a stir of the well-dressed members of the
      congregation, until a desire overcame them to see how Lady Camper would
      behave to her fish when she had him outside the sacred edifice.
    </p>
<p>
      None could have imagined such a scene. Lady Camper was in her carriage;
      General Ople was holding her prayer-book, hat in hand, at the carriage
      step, and he looked as if he were toasting before the bars of a furnace;
      for while he stood there, Lady Camper was rapidly pencilling outlines in a
      small pocket sketchbook. There are dogs whose shyness is put to it to
      endure human observation and a direct address to them, even on the part of
      their masters; and these dear simple dogs wag tail and turn their heads
      aside waveringly, as though to entreat you not to eye them and talk to
      them so. General Ople, in the presence of the sketchbook, was much like
      the nervous animal. He would fain have run away. He glanced at it, and
      round about, and again at it, and at the heavens. Her ladyship’s cruelty,
      and his inexplicable submission to it, were witnessed of the multitude.
    </p>
<p>
      The General’s friends walked very slowly. Lady Camper’s carriage whirled
      by, and the General came up with them, accosting them and himself
      alternately. They asked him where Elizabeth was, and he replied, ‘Poor
      child, yes! I am told she is pale, but I cannot, believe I am so
      perfectly, I say so perfectly ridiculous, when I join the responses.’ He
      drew forth half a dozen sheets, and showed them sketches that Lady Camper
      had taken in church, caricaturing him in the sitting down and the standing
      up. She had torn them out of the book, and presented them to him when
      driving off. ‘I was saying, worship in the ordinary sense will be
      interdicted to me if her ladyship...,’ said the General, woefully
      shuffling the sketch-paper sheets in which he figured.
    </p>
<p>
      He made the following odd confession to Mr. and Mrs. Gosling on the road:—that
      he had gone to his chest, and taken out his sword-belt to measure his
      girth, and found himself thinner than when he left the service, which had
      not been the case before his attendance at the last levee of the foregoing
      season. So the deduction was obvious, that Lady Camper had reduced him.
      She had reduced him as effectually as a harassing siege.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But why do you pay attention to her? Why...!’ exclaimed Mr. Gosling, a
      gentleman of the City, whose roundness would have turned a rifle-shot.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To allow her to wound you so seriously!’ exclaimed Mrs. Gosling.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Madam, if she were my wife,’ the General explained, ‘I should feel it. I
      say it is the fact of it; I feel it, if I appear so extremely ridiculous
      to a human eye, to any one eye.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To Lady Camper’s eye.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He admitted it might be that. He had not thought of ascribing the
      acuteness of his pain to the miserable image he presented in this
      particular lady’s eye. No; it really was true, curiously true: another
      lady’s eye might have transformed him to a pumpkin shape, exaggerated all
      his foibles fifty-fold, and he, though not liking it, of course not, would
      yet have preserved a certain manly equanimity. How was it Lady Camper had
      such power over him?—a lady concealing seventy years with a
      rouge-box or paint-pot! It was witchcraft in its worst character. He had
      for six months at her bidding been actually living the life of a beast,
      degraded in his own esteem; scorched by every laugh he heard; running,
      pursued, overtaken, and as it were scored or branded, and then let go for
      the process to be repeated.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
<p>
      Our young barbarians have it all their own way with us when they fall into
      love-liking; they lead us whither they please, and interest us in their
      wishings, their weepings, and that fine performance, their kissings. But
      when we see our veterans tottering to their fall, we scarcely consent to
      their having a wish; as for a kiss, we halloo at them if we discover them
      on a byway to the sacred grove where such things are supposed to be done
      by the venerable. And this piece of rank injustice, not to say
      impoliteness, is entirely because of an unsound opinion that Nature is not
      in it, as though it were our esteem for Nature which caused us to
      disrespect them. They, in truth, show her to us discreet, civilized, in a
      decent moral aspect: vistas of real life, views of the mind’s eye, are
      opened by their touching little emotions; whereas those bully youngsters
      who come bellowing at us and catch us by the senses plainly prove either
      that we are no better than they, or that we give our attention to Nature
      only when she makes us afraid of her. If we cared for her, we should be up
      and after her reverentially in her sedater steps, deeply studying her in
      her slower paces. She teaches them nothing when they are whirling. Our
      closest instructors, the true philosophers—the story-tellers, in
      short-will learn in time that Nature is not of necessity always roaring,
      and as soon as they do, the world may be said to be enlightened. Meantime,
      in the contemplation of a pair of white whiskers fluttering round a pair
      of manifestly painted cheeks, be assured that Nature is in it: not that
      hectoring wanton—but let the young have their fun. Let the superior
      interest of the passions of the aged be conceded, and not a word shall be
      said against the young.
    </p>
<p>
      If, then, Nature is in it, how has she been made active? The reason of her
      launch upon this last adventure is, that she has perceived the person who
      can supply the virtue known to her by experience to be wanting. Thus, in
      the broader instance, many who have journeyed far down the road, turn back
      to the worship of youth, which they have lost. Some are for the graceful
      worldliness of wit, of which they have just share enough to admire it.
      Some are captivated by hands that can wield the rod, which in earlier days
      they escaped to their cost. In the case of General Ople, it was partly her
      whippings of him, partly her penetration; her ability, that sat so finely
      on a wealthy woman, her indifference to conventional manners, that so well
      beseemed a nobly-born one, and more than all, her correction of his little
      weaknesses and incompetencies, in spite of his dislike of it, won him. He
      began to feel a sort of nibbling pleasure in her grotesque sketches of his
      person; a tendency to recur to the old ones while dreading the arrival of
      new. You hear old gentlemen speak fondly of the swish; and they are not
      attached to pain, but the instrument revives their feeling of youth; and
      General Ople half enjoyed, while shrinking, Lady Camper’s foregone
      outlines of him. For in the distance, the whip’s-end may look like a
      clinging caress instead of a stinging flick. But this craven melting in
      his heart was rebuked by a very worthy pride, that flew for support to the
      injury she had done to his devotions, and the offence to the sacred
      edifice. After thinking over it, he decided that he must quit his
      residence; and as it appeared to him in the light of duty, he, with an
      unspoken anguish, commissioned the house-agent of his town to sell his
      lease or let the house furnished, without further parley.
    </p>
<p>
      From the house-agent’s shop he turned into the chemist’s, for a tonic—a
      foolish proceeding, for he had received bracing enough in the blow he had
      just dealt himself, but he had been cogitating on tonics recently,
      imagining certain valiant effects of them, with visions of a former
      careless happiness that they were likely to restore. So he requested to
      have the tonic strong, and he took one glass of it over the counter.
    </p>
<p>
      Fifteen minutes after the draught, he came in sight of his house, and
      beholding it, he could have called it a gentlemanly residence aloud under
      Lady Camper’s windows, his insurgency was of such violence. He talked of
      it incessantly, but forbore to tell Elizabeth, as she was looking pale,
      the reason why its modest merits touched him so. He longed for the hour of
      his next dose, and for a caricature to follow, that he might drink and
      defy it. A caricature was really due to him, he thought; otherwise why had
      he abandoned his bijou dwelling? Lady Camper, however, sent none. He had
      to wait a fortnight before one came, and that was rather a likeness, and a
      handsome likeness, except as regarded a certain disorderliness in his
      dress, which he knew to be very unlike him. Still it despatched him to the
      looking-glass, to bring that verifier of facts in evidence against the
      sketch. While sitting there he heard the housemaid’s knock at the door,
      and the strange intelligence that his daughter was with Lady Camper, and
      had left word that she hoped he would not forget his engagement to go to
      Mrs. Baerens’ lawn-party.
    </p>
<p>
      The General jumped away from the glass, shouting at the absent Elizabeth
      in a fit of wrath so foreign to him, that he returned hurriedly to have
      another look at himself, and exclaimed at the pitch of his voice, ‘I say I
      attribute it to an indigestion of that tonic. Do you hear?’ The housemaid
      faintly answered outside the door that she did, alarming him, for there
      seemed to be confusion somewhere. His hope was that no one would mention
      Lady Camper’s name, for the mere thought of her caused a rush to his head.
      ‘I believe I am in for a touch of apoplexy,’ he said to the rector, who
      greeted him, in advance of the ladies, on Mr. Baerens’ lawn. He said it
      smilingly, but wanting some show of sympathy, instead of the whisper and
      meaningless hand at his clerical band, with which the rector responded, he
      cried, ‘Apoplexy,’ and his friend seemed then to understand, and
      disappeared among the ladies.
    </p>
<p>
      Several of them surrounded the General, and one inquired whether the
      series was being continued. He drew forth his pocket-book, handed her the
      latest, and remarked on the gross injustice of it; for, as he requested
      them to take note, her ladyship now sketched him as a person inattentive
      to his dress, and he begged them to observe that she had drawn him with
      his necktie hanging loose. ‘And that, I say that has never been known of
      me since I first entered society.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The ladies exchanged looks of profound concern; for the fact was, the
      General had come without any necktie and any collar, and he appeared to be
      unaware of the circumstance. The rector had told them, that in answer to a
      hint he had dropped on the subject of neckties, General Ople expressed a
      slight apprehension of apoplexy; but his careless or merely partial
      observance of the laws of buttonment could have nothing to do with such
      fears. They signified rather a disorder of the intelligence. Elizabeth was
      condemned for leaving him to go about alone. The situation was really most
      painful, for a word to so sensitive a man would drive him away in shame
      and for good; and still, to let him parade the ground in the state,
      compared with his natural self, of scarecrow, and with the dreadful habit
      of talking to himself quite rageing, was a horrible alternative. Mrs.
      Baerens at last directed her husband upon the General, trembling as though
      she watched for the operations of a fish torpedo; and other ladies shared
      her excessive anxiousness, for Mr. Baerens had the manner and the look of
      artillery, and on this occasion carried a surcharge of powder.
    </p>
<p>
      The General bent his ear to Mr. Baerens, whose German-English and repeated
      remark, ‘I am to do it wid delicassy,’ did not assist his comprehension;
      and when he might have been enlightened, he was petrified by seeing Lady
      Camper walk on the lawn with Elizabeth. The great lady stood a moment
      beside Mrs. Baerens; she came straight over to him, contemplating him in
      silence.
    </p>
<p>
      Then she said, ‘Your arm, General Ople,’ and she made one circuit of the
      lawn with him, barely speaking.
    </p>
<p>
      At her request, he conducted her to her carriage. He took a seat beside
      her, obediently. He felt that he was being sketched, and comported himself
      like a child’s flat man, that jumps at the pulling of a string.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where have you left your girl, General?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Before he could rally his wits to answer the question, he was asked:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And what have you done with your necktie and collar?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He touched his throat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am rather nervous to-day, I forgot Elizabeth,’ he said, sending his
      fingers in a dotting run of wonderment round his neck.
    </p>
<p>
      Lady Camper smiled with a triumphing humour on her close-drawn lips.
    </p>
<p>
      The verified absence of necktie and collar seemed to be choking him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never mind, you have been abroad without them,’ said Lady Camper, ‘and
      that is a victory for me. And you thought of Elizabeth first when I drew
      your attention to it, and that is a victory for you. It is a very great
      victory. Pray, do not be dismayed, General. You have a handsome
      campaigning air. And no apologies, if you please; I like you well enough
      as you are. There is my hand.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople understood her last remark. He pressed the lady’s hand in
      silence, very nervously.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But do not shrug your head into your shoulders as if there were any
      possibility of concealing the thunderingly evident,’ said Lady Camper,
      electrifying him, what with her cordial squeeze, her kind eyes, and her
      singular language. ‘You have omitted the collar. Well? The collar is the
      fatal finishing touch in men’s dress; it would make Apollo look
      bourgeois.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her hand was in his: and watching the play of her features, a spark
      entered General Ople’s brain, causing him, in forgetfulness of collar and
      caricatures, to ejaculate, ‘Seventy? Did your ladyship say seventy?
      Utterly impossible! You trifle with me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We will talk when we are free of this accompaniment of carriage-wheels,
      General,’ said Lady Camper.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will beg permission to go and fetch Elizabeth, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rightly thought of. Fetch her in my carriage. And, by the way, Mrs.
      Baerens was my old music-mistress, and is, I think, one year older than I.
      She can tell you on which side of seventy I am.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall not require to ask, my lady,’ he said, sighing.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then we will send the carriage for Elizabeth, and have it out together at
      once. I am impatient; yes, General, impatient: for what?—forgiveness.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of me, my lady?’ The General breathed profoundly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of whom else? Do you know what it is?-I don’t think you do. You English
      have the smallest experience of humanity. I mean this: to strike so hard
      that, in the end, you soften your heart to the victim. Well, that is my
      weakness. And we of our blood put no restraint on the blows we strike when
      we think them wanted, so we are always overdoing it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople assisted Lady Camper to alight from the carriage, which was
      forthwith despatched for Elizabeth.
    </p>
<p>
      He prepared to listen to her with a disconnected smile of acute
      attentiveness.
    </p>
<p>
      She had changed. She spoke of money. Ten thousand pounds must be settled
      on his daughter. ‘And now,’ said she, ‘you will remember that you are
      wanting a collar.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He acquiesced. He craved permission to retire for ten minutes.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Simplest of men! what will cover you?’ she exclaimed, and peremptorily
      bidding him sit down in the drawing-room, she took one of the famous pair
      of pistols in her hand, and said, ‘If I put myself in a similar position,
      and make myself decodletee too, will that satisfy you? You see these
      murderous weapons. Well, I am a coward. I dread fire-arms. They are laid
      there to impose on the world, and I believe they do. They have imposed on
      you. Now, you would never think of pretending to a moral quality you do
      not possess. But, silly, simple man that you are! You can give yourself
      the airs of wealth, buy horses to conceal your nakedness, and when you are
      taken upon the standard of your apparent income, you would rather seem to
      be beating a miserly retreat than behave frankly and honestly. I have a
      little overstated it, but I am near the mark.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your ladyship wanting courage!’ cried the General.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Refresh yourself by meditating on it,’ said she. ‘And to prove it to you,
      I was glad to take this house when I knew I was to have a gallant
      gentleman for a neighbour. No visitors will be admitted, General Ople, so
      you are bare-throated only to me: sit quietly. One day you speculated on
      the paint in my cheeks for the space of a minute and a half:—I had
      said that I freckled easily. Your look signified that you really could not
      detect a single freckle for the paint. I forgave you, or I did not. But
      when I found you, on closer acquaintance, as indifferent to your
      daughter’s happiness as you had been to her reputation...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My daughter! her reputation! her happiness!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople raised his eyes under a wave, half uttering the outcries.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So indifferent to her reputation, that you allowed a young man to talk
      with her over the wall, and meet her by appointment: so reckless of the
      girl’s happiness, that when I tried to bring you to a treaty, on her
      behalf, you could not be dragged from thinking of yourself and your own
      affair. When I found that, perhaps I was predisposed to give you some of
      what my sisters used to call my spice. You would not honestly state the
      proportions of your income, and you affected to be faithful to the woman
      of seventy. Most preposterous! Could any caricature of mine exceed in
      grotesqueness your sketch of yourself? You are a brave and a generous man
      all the same: and I suspect it is more hoodwinking than egotism—or
      extreme egotism—that blinds you. A certain amount you must have to
      be a man. You did not like my paint, still less did you like my sincerity;
      you were annoyed by my corrections of your habits of speech; you were
      horrified by the age of seventy, and you were credulous—General
      Ople, listen to me, and remember that you have no collar on—you were
      credulous of my statement of my great age, or you chose to be so, or chose
      to seem so, because I had brushed your cat’s coat against the fur. And
      then, full of yourself, not thinking of Elizabeth, but to withdraw in the
      chivalrous attitude of the man true to his word to the old woman, only
      stickling to bring a certain independence to the common stock, because—I
      quote you! and you have no collar on, mind—“you could not be at your
      wife’s mercy,” you broke from your proposal on the money question. Where
      was your consideration for Elizabeth then?
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, General, you were fond of thinking of yourself, and I thought I
      would assist you. I gave you plenty of subject matter. I will not say I
      meant to work a homoeopathic cure. But if I drive you to forget your
      collar, is it or is it not a triumph?
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ added Lady Camper, ‘it is no triumph for me, but it is one for you,
      if you like to make the most of it. Your fault has been to quit active
      service, General, and love your ease too well. It is the fault of your
      countrymen. You must get a militia regiment, or inspectorship of militia.
      You are ten times the man in exercise. Why, do you mean to tell me that
      you would have cared for those drawings of mine when marching?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think so, I say I think so,’ remarked the General seriously.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I doubt it,’ said she. ‘But to the point; here comes Elizabeth. If you
      have not much money to spare for her, according to your prudent
      calculation, reflect how this money has enfeebled you and reduced you to
      the level of the people round about us here—who are, what?
      Inhabitants of gentlemanly residences, yes! But what kind of creature?
      They have no mental standard, no moral aim, no native chivalry. You were
      rapidly becoming one of them, only, fortunately for you, you were
      sensitive to ridicule.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Elizabeth shall have half my money settled on her,’ said the General;
      ‘though I fear it is not much. And if I can find occupation, my lady...’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Something worthier than that,’ said Lady Camper, pencilling outlines
      rapidly on the margin of a book, and he saw himself lashing a pony; ‘or
      that,’ and he was plucking at a cabbage; ‘or that,’ and he was bowing to
      three petticoated posts.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The likeness is exact,’ General Ople groaned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So you may suppose I have studied you,’ said she. ‘But there is no real
      likeness. Slight exaggerations do more harm to truth than reckless
      violations of it.
    </p>
<p>
      You would not have cared one bit for a caricature, if you had not nursed
      the absurd idea of being one of our conquerors. It is the very tragedy of
      modesty for a man like you to have such notions, my poor dear good friend.
      The modest are the most easily intoxicated when they sip at vanity. And
      reflect whether you have not been intoxicated, for these young people have
      been wretched, and you have not observed it, though one of them was living
      with you, and is the child you love. There, I have done. Pray show a good
      face to Elizabeth.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The General obeyed as well as he could. He felt very like a sheep that has
      come from a shearing, and when released he wished to run away. But hardly
      had he escaped before he had a desire for the renewal of the operation.
      ‘She sees me through, she sees me through,’ he was heard saying to
      himself, and in the end he taught himself, to say it with a secret
      exultation, for as it was on her part an extraordinary piece of insight to
      see him through, it struck him that in acknowledging the truth of it, he
      made a discovery of new powers in human nature.
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople studied Lady Camper diligently for fresh proofs of her
      penetration of the mysteries in his bosom; by which means, as it happened
      that she was diligently observing the two betrothed young ones, he began
      to watch them likewise, and took a pleasure in the sight. Their meetings,
      their partings, their rides out and home furnished him themes of converse.
      He soon had enough to talk of, and previously, as he remembered, he had
      never sustained a conversation of any length with composure and the
      beneficent sense of fulness. Five thousand pounds, to which sum Lady
      Camper reduced her stipulation for Elizabeth’s dowry, he signed over to
      his dear girl gladly, and came out with the confession to her ladyship
      that a well-invested twelve thousand comprised his fortune. She shrugged
      she had left off pulling him this way and that, so his chains were
      enjoyable, and he said to himself: ‘If ever she should in the dead of
      night want a man to defend her!’ He mentioned it to Reginald, who had been
      the repository of Elizabeth’s lamentations about her father being left
      alone, forsaken, and the young man conceived a scheme for causing his
      aunt’s great bell to be rung at midnight, which would certainly have led
      to a dramatic issue and the happy re-establishment of our masculine
      ascendancy at the close of this history. But he forgot it in his
      bridegroom’s delight, until he was making his miserable official speech at
      the wedding-breakfast, and set Elizabeth winking over a tear. As she stood
      in the hall ready to depart, a great van was observed in the road at the
      gates of Douro Lodge; and this, the men in custody declared to contain the
      goods and knick-knacks of the people who had taken the house furnished for
      a year, and were coming in that very afternoon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I remember, I say now I remember, I had a notice,’ the General said
      cheerily to his troubled daughter.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But where are you to go, papa?’ the poor girl cried, close on sobbing.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall get employment of some sort,’ said he. ‘I was saying I want it, I
      need it, I require it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are saying three times what once would have sufficed for,’ said Lady
      Camper, and she asked him a few questions, frowned with a smile, and
      offered him a lodgement in his neighbour’s house.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Really, dearest Aunt Angela?’ said Elizabeth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What else can I do, child? I have, it seems, driven him out of a
      gentlemanly residence, and I must give him a ladylike one. True, I would
      rather have had him at call, but as I have always wished for a policeman
      in the house, I may as well be satisfied with a soldier.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But if you lose your character, my lady?’ said Reginald.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then I must look to the General to restore it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      General Ople immediately bowed his head over Lady Camper’s fingers.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘An odd thing to happen to a woman of forty-one!’ she said to her great
      people, and they submitted with the best grace in the world, while the
      General’s ears tingled till he felt younger than Reginald. This, his
      reflections ran, or it would be more correct to say waltzed, this is the
      result of painting!—that you can believe a woman to be any age when
      her cheeks are tinted!
    </p>
<p>
      As for Lady Camper, she had been floated accidentally over the ridicule of
      the bruit of a marriage at a time of life as terrible to her as her
      fiction of seventy had been to General Ople; she resigned herself to let
      things go with the tide. She had not been blissful in her first marriage,
      she had abandoned the chase of an ideal man, and she had found one who was
      tunable so as not to offend her ears, likely ever to be a fund of
      amusement for her humour, good, impressible, and above all, very
      picturesque. There is the secret of her, and of how it came to pass that a
      simple man and a complex woman fell to union after the strangest division.

<h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
<p>
      A proper tenderness for the Peerage will continue to pass current the
      illustrious gentleman who was inflamed by Cupid’s darts to espouse the
      milkmaid, or dairymaid, under his ballad title of Duke of Dewlap: nor was
      it the smallest of the services rendered him by Beau Beamish, that he
      clapped the name upon her rustic Grace, the young duchess, the very first
      day of her arrival at the Wells. This happy inspiration of a wit never
      failing at a pinch has rescued one of our princeliest houses from the
      assaults of the vulgar, who are ever too rejoiced to bespatter and
      disfigure a brilliant coat-of-arms; insomuch that the ballad, to which we
      are indebted for the narrative of the meeting and marriage of the ducal
      pair, speaks of Dewlap in good faith—
    </p>
<pre>
        O the ninth Duke of Dewlap I am, Susie dear!
</pre>
<p>
      without a hint of a domino title. So likewise the pictorial historian is
      merry over ‘Dewlap alliances’ in his description of the society of that
      period. He has read the ballad, but disregarded the memoirs of the beau.
      Writers of pretension would seem to have an animus against individuals of
      the character of Mr. Beamish. They will treat of the habits and manners of
      highwaymen, and quote obscure broadsheets and songs of the people to
      colour their story, yet decline to bestow more than a passing remark upon
      our domestic kings: because they are not hereditary, we may suppose. The
      ballad of ‘The Duke and the Dairymaid,’ ascribed with questionable
      authority to the pen of Mr. Beamish himself in a freak of his gaiety, was
      once popular enough to provoke the moralist to animadversions upon an
      order of composition that ‘tempted every bouncing country lass to sidle an
      eye in a blowsy cheek’ in expectation of a coronet for her pains—and
      a wet ditch as the result! We may doubt it to have been such an occasion
      of mischief. But that mischief may have been done by it to a
      nobility-loving people, even to the love of our nobility among the people,
      must be granted; and for the particular reason, that the hero of the
      ballad behaved so handsomely. We perceive a susceptibility to adulteration
      in their worship at the sight of one of their number, a young maid,
      suddenly snatched up to the gaping heights of Luxury and Fashion through
      sheer good looks. Remembering that they are accustomed to a totally
      reverse effect from that possession, it is very perceptible how a breach
      in their reverence may come of the change.
    </p>
<p>
      Otherwise the ballad is innocent; certainly it is innocent in design. A
      fresher national song of a beautiful incident of our country life has
      never been written. The sentiments are natural, the imagery is apt and
      redolent of the soil, the music of the verse appeals to the dullest ear.
      It has no smell of the lamp, nothing foreign and far-fetched about it, but
      is just what it pretends to be, the carol of the native bird. A sample
      will show, for the ballad is much too long to be given entire:
    </p>
<pre>
     Sweet Susie she tripped on a shiny May morn,
     As blithe as the lark from the green-springing corn,
     When, hard by a stile, ‘twas her luck to behold
     A wonderful gentleman covered with gold!

     There was gold on his breeches and gold on his coat,
     His shirt-frill was grand as a fifty-pound note;
     The diamonds glittered all up him so bright,
     She thought him the Milky Way clothing a Sprite!

     ‘Fear not, pretty maiden,’ he said with a smile;
     ‘And, pray, let me help you in crossing the stile.
     She bobbed him a curtsey so lovely and smart,
     It shot like an arrow and fixed in his heart.

     As light as a robin she hopped to the stone,
     But fast was her hand in the gentleman’s own;
     And guess how she stared, nor her senses could trust,
     When this creamy gentleman knelt in the dust!
</pre>
<p>
      With a rhapsody upon her beauty, he informs her of his rank, for a
      flourish to the proposal of honourable and immediate marriage. He cannot
      wait. This is the fatal condition of his love: apparently a characteristic
      of amorous dukes. We read them in the signs extended to us. The minds of
      these august and solitary men have not yet been sounded; they are too
      distant. Standing upon their lofty pinnacles, they are as legible to the
      rabble below as a line of cuneiform writing in a page of old copybook
      roundhand. By their deeds we know them, as heathendom knows of its gods;
      and it is repeatedly on record that the moment they have taken fire they
      must wed, though the lady’s finger be circled with nothing closer fitting
      than a ring of the bed-curtain. Vainly, as becomes a candid country lass,
      blue-eyed Susan tells him that she is but a poor dairymaid. He has been a
      student of women at Courts, in which furnace the sex becomes a
      transparency, so he recounts to her the catalogue of material advantages
      he has to offer. Finally, after his assurances that she is to be married
      by the parson, really by the parson, and a real parson—
    </p>
<pre>
     Sweet Susie is off for her parents’ consent,
     And long must the old folk debate what it meant.
     She left them the eve of that happy May morn,
     To shine like the blossom that hangs from the thorn!
</pre>
<p>
      Apart from its historical value, the ballad is an example to poets of our
      day, who fly to mythological Greece, or a fanciful and morbid
      mediaevalism, or—save the mark!—abstract ideas, for themes of
      song, of what may be done to make our English life poetically interesting,
      if they would but pluck the treasures presented them by the wayside; and
      Nature being now as then the passport to popularity, they have themselves
      to thank for their little hold on the heart of the people. A living native
      duke is worth fifty Phoebus Apollos to Englishmen, and a buxom young lass
      of the fields mounting from a pair of pails to the estate of duchess, a
      more romantic object than troops of your visionary Yseults and Guineveres.

<h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<p>
      A certain time after the marriage, his Grace alighted at the Wells, and
      did himself the honour to call on Mr. Beamish. Addressing that gentleman,
      to whom he was no stranger, he communicated the purport of his visit.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sir, and my very good friend,’ he said, ‘first let me beg you to abate
      the severity of your countenance, for if I am here in breach of your
      prohibition, I shall presently depart in compliance with it. I could
      indeed deplore the loss of the passion for play of which you effectually
      cured me. I was then armed against a crueller, that allows of no interval
      for a man to make his vow to recover!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The disease which is all crisis, I apprehend,’ Mr. Beamish remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Which, sir, when it takes hold of dry wood, burns to the last splinter.
      It is now’—the duke fetched a tender groan—‘three years ago
      that I had a caprice to marry a grandchild!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of Adam’s,’ Mr. Beamish said cheerfully. ‘There was no legitimate bar to
      the union.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Unhappily none. Yet you are not to suppose I regret it. A most admirable
      creature, Mr. Beamish, a real divinity! And the better known, the more
      adored. There is the misfortune. At my season of life, when the greater
      and the minor organs are in a conspiracy to tell me I am mortal, the
      passion of love must be welcomed as a calamity, though one would not be
      free of it for the renewal of youth. You are to understand, that with a
      little awakening taste for dissipation, she is the most innocent of
      angels. Hitherto we have lived... To her it has been a new world. But she
      is beginning to find it a narrow one. No, no, she is not tired of my
      society. Very far from that. But in her present station an inclination for
      such gatherings as you have here, for example, is like a desire to take
      the air: and the healthy habits of my duchess have not accustomed her to
      be immured. And in fine, devote ourselves as we will, a term approaches
      when the enthusiasm for serving as your wife’s playfellow all day, running
      round tables and flying along corridors before a knotted handkerchief, is
      mightily relaxed. Yet the dread of a separation from her has kept me at
      these pastimes for a considerable period beyond my relish of them. Not
      that I acknowledge fatigue. I have, it seems, a taste for reflection; I am
      now much disposed to read and meditate, which cannot be done without
      repose. I settle myself, and I receive a worsted ball in my face, and I am
      expected to return it. I comply; and then you would say a nursery in arms.
      It would else be the deplorable spectacle of a beautiful young woman
      yawning.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Earthquake and saltpetre threaten us less terribly,’ said Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In fine, she has extracted a promise that ‘this summer she shall visit
      the Wells for a month, and I fear I cannot break my pledge of my word; I
      fear I cannot.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Very certainly I would not,’ said Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      The duke heaved a sigh. ‘There are reasons, family reasons, why my company
      and protection must be denied to her here. I have no wish... indeed my
      name, for the present, until such time as she shall have found her feet...
      and there is ever a penalty to pay for that. Ah, Mr. Beamish, pictures are
      ours, when we have bought them and hung them up; but who insures us
      possession of a beautiful work of Nature? I have latterly betaken me to
      reflect much and seriously. I am tempted to side with the Divines in the
      sermons I have read; the flesh is the habitation of a rebellious devil.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To whom we object in proportion as we ourselves become quit of him,’ Mr.
      Beamish acquiesced.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But this mania of young people for pleasure, eternal pleasure, is one of
      the wonders. It does not pall on them; they are insatiate.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is the cataract, and there is the cliff. Potentate to potentate,
      duke—so long as you are on my territory, be it understood. Upon my
      way to a place of worship once, I passed a Puritan, who was complaining of
      a butterfly that fluttered prettily abroad in desecration of the Day of
      Rest. “Friend,” said I to him, “conclusively you prove to me that you are
      not a butterfly.” Surly did no more than favour me with the anathema of
      his countenance.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Cousin Beamish, my complaint of these young people is, that they miss
      their pleasure in pursuing it. I have lectured my duchess—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ha!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Foolish, I own,’ said the duke. ‘But suppose, now, you had caught your
      butterfly, and you could neither let it go nor consent to follow its
      vagaries. That poses you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Young people,’ said Mr. Beamish, ‘come under my observation in this poor
      realm of mine—young and old. I find them prodigiously alike in their
      love of pleasure, differing mainly in their capacity to satisfy it. That
      is no uncommon observation. The young, have an edge which they are
      desirous of blunting; the old contrariwise. The cry of the young for
      pleasure is actually—I have studied their language—a cry for
      burdens. Curious! And the old ones cry for having too many on their
      shoulders: which is not astonishing. Between them they make an agreeable
      concert both to charm the ears and guide the steps of the philosopher,
      whose wisdom it is to avoid their tracks.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good. But I have asked you for practical advice, and you give me an
      essay.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For the reason, duke, that you propose a case that suggests hanging. You
      mention two things impossible to be done. The alternative is, a garter and
      the bedpost. When we have come upon crossways, and we can decide neither
      to take the right hand nor the left, neither forward nor back, the index
      of the board which would direct us points to itself, and emphatically
      says, Gallows.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beamish, I am distracted. If I refuse her the visit, I foresee
      dissensions, tears, games at ball, romps, not one day of rest remaining to
      me. I could be of a mind with your Puritan, positively. If I allow it, so
      innocent a creature in the atmosphere of a place like this must suffer
      some corruption. You should know that the station I took her from was ...
      it was modest. She was absolutely a buttercup of the fields. She has had
      various masters. She dances... she dances prettily, I could say
      bewitchingly. And so she is now for airing her accomplishments: such are
      women!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have you heard of Chloe?’ said Mr. Beamish. ‘There you have an example of
      a young lady uncorrupted by this place—of which I would only remark
      that it is best unvisited, but better tasted than longed for.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Chloe? A lady who squandered her fortune to redeem some ill-requiting
      rascal: I remember to have heard of her. She is here still? And ruined, of
      course?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In purse.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That cannot be without the loss of reputation.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Chloe’s champion will grant that she is exposed to the evils of
      improvidence. The more brightly shine her native purity, her goodness of
      heart, her trustfulness. She is a lady whose exaltation glows in her
      abasement.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has, I see, preserved her comeliness,’ observed the duke, with a
      smile.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Despite the flying of the roses, which had not her heart’s patience. ‘Tis
      now the lily that reigns. So, then, Chloe shall be attached to the duchess
      during her stay, and unless the devil himself should interfere, I
      guarantee her Grace against any worse harm than experience; and that,’ Mr.
      Beamish added, as the duke raised his arms at the fearful word, ‘that
      shall be mild. Play she will; she is sure to play. Put it down at a
      thousand. We map her out a course of permissible follies, and she plays to
      lose the thousand by degrees, with as telling an effect upon a connubial
      conscience as we can produce.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A thousand,’ said the duke, ‘will be cheap indeed. I think now I have had
      a description of this fair Chloe, and from an enthusiast; a brune?
      elegantly mannered and of a good landed family; though she has thought
      proper to conceal her name. And that will be our difficulty, cousin
      Beamish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She was, under my dominion, Miss Martinsward,’ Mr. Beamish pursued. ‘She
      came here very young, and at once her suitors were legion. In the way of
      women, she chose the worst among them; and for the fellow Caseldy she
      sacrificed the fortune she had inherited of a maternal uncle. To release
      him from prison, she paid all his debts; a mountain of bills, with the
      lawyers piled above—Pelion upon Ossa, to quote our poets. In fact,
      obeying the dictates of a soul steeped in generosity, she committed the
      indiscretion to strip herself, scandalizing propriety. This was
      immediately on her coming of age; and it was the death-blow to her
      relations with her family. Since then, honoured even by rakes, she has
      lived impoverished at the Wells. I dubbed her Chloe, and man or woman
      disrespectful to Chloe packs. From being the victim of her generous
      disposition, I could not save her; I can protect her from the shafts of
      malice.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has no passion for play?’ inquired the duke.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She nourishes a passion for the man for whom she bled, to the exclusion
      of the other passions. She lives, and I believe I may say that it is the
      motive of her rising and dressing daily, in expectation of his advent.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He may be dead.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The dog is alive. And he has not ceased to be Handsome Caseldy, they say.
      Between ourselves, duke, there is matter to break her heart. He has been
      the Count Caseldy of Continental gaming tables, and he is recently Sir
      Martin Caseldy, settled on the estate she made him free to take up intact
      on his father’s decease.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pah! a villain!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With a blacker brand upon him every morning that he looks forth across
      his property, and leaves her to languish! She still—I say it to the
      redemption of our sex—has offers. Her incomparable attractions of
      mind and person exercise the natural empire of beauty. But she will none
      of them. I call her the Fair Suicide. She has died for love; and she is a
      ghost, a good ghost, and a pleasing ghost, but an apparition, a taper.
    </p>
<p>
      The duke fidgeted, and expressed a hope to hear that she was not of
      melancholy conversation; and again, that the subject of her discourse was
      not confined to love and lovers, happy or unhappy. He wished his duchess,
      he said, to be entertained upon gayer topics: love being a theme he
      desired to reserve to himself. ‘This month!’ he said, prognostically
      shaking and moaning. ‘I would this month were over, and that we were well
      purged of it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish reassured him. The wit and sprightliness of Chloe were so
      famous as to be considered medical, he affirmed; she was besieged for her
      company; she composed and sang impromptu verses, she played harp and
      harpsichord divinely, and touched the guitar, and danced, danced like the
      silvery moon on the waters of the mill pool. He concluded by saying that
      she was both humane and wise, humble-minded and amusing, virtuous yet not
      a Tartar; the best of companions for her Grace the young duchess.
      Moreover, he boldly engaged to carry the duchess through the term of her
      visit under a name that should be as good as a masquerade for concealing
      his Grace’s, while giving her all the honours due to her rank.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You strictly interpret my wishes,’ said the duke; ‘all honours, the
      foremost place, and my wrath upon man or woman gainsaying them!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mine! if you please, duke,’ said Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A thousand pardons! I leave it to you, cousin. I could not be in safer
      hands. I am heartily bounders to you. Chloe, then. By the way, she has a
      decent respect for age?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She is reverentially inclined.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not that. She is, I would ask, no wanton prattler of the charms and
      advantages of youth?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has a young adorer that I have dubbed Alonzo, whom she scarce
      notices.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing could be better. Alonzo: h’m! A faithful swain?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Life is his tree, upon which unceasingly he carves his mistress’s
      initials.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She should not be too cruel. I recollect myself formerly: I was... Young
      men will, when long slighted, transfer their affections, and be warmer to
      the second flame than to the first. I put you on your guard. He follows
      her much? These lovers’ paintings and puffings in the neighbourhood of the
      most innocent of women are contagious.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Her Grace will be running home all the sooner.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Or off!—may she forgive me! I am like a King John’s Jew, forced to
      lend his treasure without security. What a world is ours! Nothing,
      Beamish, nothing desirable will you have which is not coveted! Catch a
      prize, and you will find you are at war with your species. You have to be
      on the defensive from that moment. There is no such thing as peaceable
      procession on earth. Let it be a beautiful young woman!—Ah!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish replied bracingly, ‘The champion wrestler challenges all
      comers while he wears the belt.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The duke dejectedly assented. ‘True; or he is challenged, say. Is there
      any tale we could tell her of this Alonzo? You could deport him for the
      month, my dear Beamish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I commit no injustice unless with sufficient reason. It is an estimable
      youth, as shown by his devotion to a peerless woman. To endow her with his
      name and fortune is his only thought.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I perceive; an excellent young fellow! I have an incipient liking for
      this young Alonzo. You must not permit my duchess to laugh at him.
      Encourage her rather to advance his suit. The silliness of a young man
      will be no bad spectacle. Chloe, then. You have set my mind at rest,
      Beamish, and it is but another obligation added to the heap; so, if I do
      not speak of payment, the reason is that I know you would not have me
      bankrupt.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The remainder of the colloquy of the duke and Mr. Beamish referred to the
      date of her Grace’s coming to the Wells, the lodgement she was to receive,
      and other minor arrangements bearing upon her state and comfort; the duke
      perpetually observing, ‘But I leave it all to you, Beamish,’ when he had
      laid down precise instructions in these respects, even to the
      specification of the shopkeepers, the confectioner and the apothecary, who
      were to balance or cancel one another in the opposite nature of their
      supplies, and the haberdasher and the jeweller, with whom she was to make
      her purchases. For the duke had a recollection of giddy shops, and of
      giddy shopmen too; and it was by serving as one for a day that a certain
      great nobleman came to victory with a jealously guarded dame beautiful as
      Venus. ‘I would have challenged the goddess!’ he cried, and subsided from
      his enthusiasm plaintively, like a weak wind instrument. ‘So there you see
      the prudence of a choice of shops. But I leave it to you, Beamish.’ 
      Similarly the great military commander, having done whatsoever a careful
      prevision may suggest to insure him victory, casts himself upon
      Providence, with the hope of propitiating the unanticipated and darkly
      possible.

<h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
<p>
      The splendid equipage of a coach and six, with footmen in scarlet and
      green, carried Beau Beamish five miles along the road on a sunny day to
      meet the young duchess at the boundary of his territory, and conduct her
      in state to the Wells. Chloe sat beside him, receiving counsel with regard
      to her prospective duties. He was this day the consummate beau, suave, but
      monarchical, and his manner of speech partook of his external grandeur.
      ‘Spy me the horizon, and apprise me if somewhere you distinguish a
      chariot,’ he said, as they drew up on the rise of a hill of long descent,
      where the dusty roadway sank between its brown hedges, and crawled
      mounting from dry rush-spotted hollows to corn fields on a companion
      height directly facing them, at a remove of about three-quarters of a
      mile. Chloe looked forth, while the beau passingly raised his hat for
      coolness, and murmured, with a glance down the sultry track: ‘It sweats
      the eye to see!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Presently Chloe said, ‘Now a dust blows. Something approaches. Now I
      discern horses, now a vehicle; and it is a chariot!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Orders were issued to the outriders for horns to be sounded.
    </p>
<p>
      Both Chloe and Beau Beamish wrinkled their foreheads at the disorderly
      notes of triple horns, whose pealing made an acid in the air instead of
      sweetness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You would say, kennel dogs that bay the moon!’ said the wincing beau.
      ‘Yet, as you know, these fellows have been exercised. I have had them out
      in a meadow for hours, baked and drenched, to get them rid of their native
      cacophony. But they love it, as they love bacon and beans. The musical
      taste of our people is in the stage of the primitive appetite for noise,
      and for that they are gluttons.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It will be pleasant to hear in the distance,’ Chloe replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, the extremer the distance, the pleasanter to hear. Are they
      advancing?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They stop. There is a cavalier at the window. Now he doffs his hat.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sweepingly?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe described a semicircle in the grand manner.
    </p>
<p>
      The beau’s eyebrows rose. ‘Powers divine!’ he muttered. ‘She is let loose
      from hand to hand, and midway comes a cavalier. We did not count on the
      hawks. So I have to deal with a cavalier! It signifies, my dear Chloe,
      that I must incontinently affect the passion if I am to be his match:
      nothing less.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He has flown,’ said Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Whom she encounters after meeting me, I care not,’ quoth the beau,
      snapping a finger. ‘But there has been an interval for damage with a lady
      innocent as Eve. Is she advancing?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The chariot is trotting down the hill. He has ridden back. She has no
      attendant horseman.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They were dismissed at my injunction ten miles off particularly to the
      benefit of the cavaliering horde, it would appear. In the case of a woman,
      Chloe, one blink of the eyelids is an omission of watchfulness.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is an axiom fit for the harem of the Grand Signior.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Grand Signior might give us profitable lessons for dealing with the
      sex.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Distrust us, and it is a declaration of war!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Trust you, and the stopper is out of the smelling-bottle.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr. Beamish, we are women, but we have souls.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The pip in the apple whose ruddy cheek allures little Tommy to rob the
      orchard is as good a preservative.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You admit that men are our enemies?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I maintain that they carry the banner of virtue.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, Mr. Beamish, I shall expire.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I forbid it in my lifetime, Chloe, for I wish to die believing in one
      woman.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No flattery for me at the expense of my sisters!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then fly to a hermitage; for all flattery is at somebody’s expense,
      child. ‘Tis an essence-extract of humanity! To live on it, in the fashion
      of some people, is bad—it is downright cannibal. But we may sprinkle
      our handkerchiefs with it, and we should, if we would caress our noses
      with an air. Society, my Chloe, is a recommencement upon an upper level of
      the savage system; we must have our sacrifices. As, for instance, what say
      you of myself beside our booted bumpkin squires?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hundreds of them, Mr. Beamish!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is a holocaust of squires reduced to make an incense for me, though
      you have not performed Druid rites and packed them in gigantic osier ribs.
      Be philosophical, but accept your personal dues. Grant us ours too. I have
      a serious intention to preserve this young duchess, and I expect my task
      to be severe. I carry the banner aforesaid; verily and penitentially I do.
      It is an error of the vulgar to suppose that all is dragon in the dragon’s
      jaws.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Men are his fangs and claws.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, but the passion for his fiery breath is in woman. She will take her
      leap and have her jump, will and will! And at the point where she will and
      she won’t, the dragon gulps and down she goes! However, the business is to
      keep our buttercup duchess from that same point. Is she near?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can see her,’ said Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      Beau Beamish requested a sketch of her, and Chloe began: ‘She is
      ravishing.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Upon which he commented, ‘Every woman is ravishing at forty paces, and
      still more so in imagination.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beautiful auburn hair, and a dazzling red and white complexion, set in a
      blue coif.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Her eyes?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Melting blue.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘‘Tis an English witch!’ exclaimed the beau, and he compassionately
      invoked her absent lord.
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe’s optics were no longer tasked to discern the fair lady’s
      lineaments, for the chariot windows came flush with those of the beau on
      the broad plateau of the hill. His coach door was opened. He sat upright,
      levelling his privileged stare at Duchess Susan until she blushed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, madam,’ quoth he, ‘I am not the first.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘La, sir!’ said she; ‘who are you?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The beau deliberately raised his hat and bowed. ‘He, madam, of whose
      approach the gentleman who took his leave of you on yonder elevation
      informed you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She looked artlessly over her shoulder, and at the beau alighting from his
      carriage. ‘A gentleman?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On horseback.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The duchess popped her head through the window on an impulse to measure
      the distance between the two hills.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never!’ she cried.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, madam, did he deliver no message to announce me?’ said the beau,
      ruffling.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Goodness gracious! You must be Mr. Beamish,’ she replied.
    </p>
<p>
      He laid his hat on his bosom, and invited her to quit her carriage for a
      seat beside him. She stipulated, ‘If you are really Mr. Beamish?’ He
      frowned, and raised his head to convince her; but she would not be
      impressed, and he applied to Chloe to establish his identity. Hearing
      Chloe’s name, the duchess called out, ‘Oh! there, now, that’s enough, for
      Chloe’s my maid here, and I know she’s a lady born, and we’re going to be
      friends. Hand me to Chloe. And you are Chloe?’ she said, after a frank
      stride from step to step of the carriages. ‘And don’t mind being my maid?
      You do look a nice, kind creature. And I see you’re a lady born; I know in
      a minute. You’re dark, I’m fair; we shall suit. And tell me—hush!—what
      dreadful long eyes he has! I shall ask you presently what you think of me.
      I was never at the Wells before. Dear me! the coach has turned. How far
      off shall we hear the bells to say I’m coming? I know I’m to have bells.
      Mr. Beamish, Mr. Beamish! I must have a chatter with a woman, and I’m in
      awe of you, sir, that I am, but men and men I see to talk to for a lift of
      my finger, by the dozen, in my duke’s palace—though they’re old
      ones, that’s true—but a woman who’s a lady, and kind enough to be my
      maid, I haven’t met yet since I had the right to wear a coronet. There,
      I’ll hold Chloe’s hand, and that’ll do. You would tell me at once, Chloe,
      if I was not dressed to your taste; now, wouldn’t you? As for talkative,
      that’s a sign with me of my liking people. I really don’t know what to say
      to my duke sometimes. I sit and think it so funny to be having a duke
      instead of a husband. You’re off!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The duchess laughed at Chloe’s laughter. Chloe excused herself, but was
      informed by her mistress that it was what she liked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For the first two years,’ she resumed, ‘I could hardly speak a syllable.
      I stammered, I reddened, I longed to be up in my room brushing and curling
      my hair, and was ready to curtsey to everybody. Now I’m quite at home, for
      I’ve plenty of courage—except about death, and I’m worse about death
      than I was when I was a simple body with a gawk’s “lawks!” in her round
      eyes and mouth for an egg. I wonder why that is? But isn’t death horrible?
      And skeletons!’ The duchess shuddered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It depends upon the skeleton,’ said Beau Beamish, who had joined the
      conversation. ‘Yours, madam, I would rather not meet, because she would
      precipitate me into transports of regret for the loss of the flesh. I
      have, however, met mine own and had reason for satisfaction with the
      interview.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your own skeleton, sir!’ said the duchess wonderingly and appalled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Unmistakably mine. I will call you to witness by an account of him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan gaped, and, ‘Oh, don’t!’ she cried out; but added, ‘It ‘s
      broad day, and I’ve got some one to sleep anigh me after dark’; with which
      she smiled on Chloe, who promised her there was no matter for alarm.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I encountered my gentleman as I was proceeding to my room at night,’ said
      the beau, ‘along a narrow corridor, where it was imperative that one of us
      should yield the ‘pas;’ and, I must confess it, we are all so amazingly
      alike in our bones, that I stood prepared to demand place of him. For
      indubitably the fellow was an obstruction, and at the first glance
      repulsive. I took him for anybody’s skeleton, Death’s ensign, with his
      cachinnatory skull, and the numbered ribs, and the extraordinary splay
      feet—in fact, the whole ungainly and shaky hobbledehoy which man is
      built on, and by whose image in his weaker moments he is haunted. I had,
      to be frank, been dancing on a supper with certain of our choicest Wits
      and Beauties. It is a recipe for conjuring apparitions. Now, then, thinks
      I, my fine fellow, I will bounce you; and without a salutation I pressed
      forward. Madam, I give you my word, he behaved to the full pitch as I
      myself should have done under similar circumstances. Retiring upon an
      inclination of his structure, he draws up and fetches me a bow of the
      exact middle nick between dignity and service. I advance, he withdraws,
      and again the bow, devoid of obsequiousness, majestically condescending.
      These, thinks I, be royal manners. I could have taken him for the Sable
      King in person, stripped of his mantle. On my soul, he put me to the
      blush.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And is that all?’ asked the duchess, relieving herself with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, madam,’ quoth the beau, ‘do you not see that he could have been none
      other than mine own, who could comport himself with that grand air and
      gracefulness when wounded by his closest relative? Upon his opening my
      door for me, and accepting the ‘pas,’ which I now right heartily accorded
      him, I recognized at once both him and the reproof he had designedly dealt
      me—or the wine supper I had danced on, perhaps I should say’ and I
      protest that by such a display of supreme good breeding he managed to
      convey the highest compliment ever received by man, namely the assurance,
      that after the withering away of this mortal garb, I shall still be noted
      for urbanity and elegancy. Nay, and more, immortally, without the slip I
      was guilty of when I carried the bag of wine.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan fanned herself to assist her digestion of the anecdote.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, it’s not so frightful a story, and I know you are the great Mr.
      Beamish;’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      He questioned her whether the gentleman had signalled him to her on the
      hill.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What can he mean about a gentleman?’ she turned to Chloe. ‘My duke told
      me you would meet me, sir. And you are to protect me. And if anything
      happens, it is to be your fault.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Entirely,’ said the beau. ‘I shall therefore maintain a vigilant guard.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Except leaving me free. Oof! I’ve been boxed up so long. I declare,
      Chloe, I feel like a best dress out for a holiday, and a bit afraid of
      spoiling. I’m a real child, more than I was when my duke married me. I
      seemed to go in and grow up again, after I was raised to fortune. And
      nobody to tell of it! Fancy that! For you can’t talk to old gentlemen
      about what’s going on in your heart.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How of young gentlemen?’ she was asked by the beau.
    </p>
<p>
      And she replied, ‘They find it out.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not if you do not assist them,’ said he.
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan let her eyelids and her underlie half drop, as she looked at
      him with the simple shyness of one of nature’s thoughts in her head at
      peep on the pastures of the world. The melting blue eyes and the cherry
      lip made an exceedingly quickening picture. ‘Now, I wonder if that is
      true?’ she transferred her slyness to speech.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beware the middle-aged!’ he exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
      She appealed to Chloe. ‘And I’m sure they’re the nicest.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe agreed that they were.
    </p>
<p>
      The duchess measured Chloe and the beau together, with a mind swift in
      apprehending all that it hungered for.
    </p>
<p>
      She would have pursued the pleasing theme had she not been directed to
      gaze below upon the towers and roofs of the Wells, shining sleepily in a
      siesta of afternoon Summer sunlight.
    </p>
<p>
      With a spread of her silken robe, she touched the edifice of her hair,
      murmuring to Chloe, ‘I can’t abide that powder. You shall see me walk in a
      hoop. I can. I’ve done it to slow music till my duke clapped hands. I’m
      nothing sitting to what I am on my feet. That’s because I haven’t got fine
      language yet. I shall. It seems to come last. So, there ‘s the place. And
      whereabouts do all the great people meet and prommy—?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They promenade where you see the trees, madam,’ said Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And where is it where the ladies sit and eat jam tarts with whipped cream
      on ‘em, while the gentlemen stand and pay compliments?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe said it was at a shop near the pump room.
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan looked out over the house-tops, beyond the dusty hedges.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, and that powder!’ she cried. ‘I hate to be out of the fashion and a
      spectacle. But I do love my own hair, and I have such a lot, and I like
      the colour, and so does my duke. Only, don’t let me be fingered at. If
      once I begin to blush before people, my courage is gone; my singing inside
      me is choked; and I’ve a real lark going on in me all day long, rain or
      sunshine—hush, all about love and amusement.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe smiled, and Duchess Susan said, ‘Just like a bird, for I don’t know
      what it is.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She looked for Chloe to say that she did.
    </p>
<p>
      At the moment a pair of mounted squires rode up, and the coach stopped,
      while Beau Beamish gave orders for the church bells to be set ringing, and
      the band to meet and precede his equipage at the head of the bath avenue:
      ‘in honour of the arrival of her Grace the Duchess of Dewlap.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He delivered these words loudly to his men, and turned an effulgent gaze
      upon the duchess, so that for a minute she was fascinated and did not
      consult her hearing; but presently she fell into an uneasiness; the signs
      increased, she bit her lip, and after breathing short once or twice, ‘Was
      it meaning me, Mr. Beamish?’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You, madam, are the person whom we ‘delight to honour,’ he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Duchess of what?’ she screwed uneasy features to hear.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Duchess of Dewlap,’ said he.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s not my title, sir.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is your title on my territory, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She made her pretty nose and upper lip ugly with a sneer of ‘Dew—!
      And enter that town before all those people as Duchess of... Oh, no, I
      won’t; I just won’t! Call back those men now, please; now, if you please.
      Pray, Mr. Beamish! You’ll offend me, sir. I’m not going to be a mock.
      You’ll offend my duke, sir. He’d die rather than have my feelings hurt.
      Here’s all my pleasure spoilt. I won’t and I sha’n’t enter the town as
      duchess of that stupid name, so call ‘em back, call ‘em back this instant.
      I know who I am and what I am, and I know what’s due to me, I do.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Beau Beamish rejoined, ‘I too. Chloe will tell you I am lord here.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then I’ll go home, I will. I won’t be laughed at for a great lady ninny.
      I’m a real lady of high rank, and such I’ll appear. What ‘s a Duchess of
      Dewlap? One might as well be Duchess of Cowstail, Duchess of Mopsend. And
      those people! But I won’t be that. I won’t be played with. I see them
      staring! No, I can make up my mind, and I beg you to call back your men,
      or I’ll go back home.’ She muttered, ‘Be made fun of—made a fool
      of!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your Grace’s chariot is behind,’ said the beau.
    </p>
<p>
      His despotic coolness provoked her to an outcry and weeping: she repeated,
      ‘Dewlap! Dewlap!’ in sobs; she shook her shoulders and hid her face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are proud of your title, are you, madam?’ said he.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am.’ She came out of her hands to answer him proudly. ‘That I am!’ she
      meant for a stronger affirmation.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then mark me,’ he said impressively; ‘I am your duke’s friend, and you
      are under my charge here. I am your guardian and you are my ward, and you
      can enter the town only on the condition of obedience to me. Now, mark me,
      madam; no one can rob you of your real name and title saving yourself. But
      you are entering a place where you will encounter a thousand temptations
      to tarnish, and haply forfeit it. Be warned do nothing that will.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then I’m to have my own title?’ said she, clearing up.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For the month of your visit you are Duchess of Dewlap.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I say I sha’n’t!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You shall.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never, sir!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I command it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She flung herself forward, with a wail, upon Chloe’s bosom. ‘Can’t you do
      something for me?’ she whimpered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is impossible to move Mr. Beamish,’ Chloe said.
    </p>
<p>
      Out of a pause, composed of sobs and sighs, the duchess let loose in a
      broken voice: ‘Then I ‘m sure I think—I think I’d rather have met—have
      met his skeleton!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her sincerity was equal to wit.
    </p>
<p>
      Beau Beamish shouted. He cordially applauded her, and in the genuine
      kindness of an admiration that surprised him, he permitted himself the
      liberty of taking and saluting her fingers. She fancied there was another
      chance for her, but he frowned at the mention of it.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon these proceedings the exhilarating sound of the band was heard;
      simultaneously a festival peal of bells burst forth; and an admonishment
      of the necessity for concealing her chagrin and exhibiting both station
      and a countenance to the people, combined with the excitement of the new
      scenes and the marching music to banish the acuter sense of disappointment
      from Duchess Susan’s mind; so she very soon held herself erect, and wore a
      face open to every wonder, impressionable as the blue lake-surface,
      crisped here and there by fitful breezes against a level sun.

<h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<p>
      It was an axiom with Mr. Beamish, our first, if not our only philosophical
      beau and a gentleman of some thoughtfulness, that the social English
      require tyrannical government as much as the political are able to
      dispense with it: and this he explained by an exposition of the character
      of a race possessed of the eminent virtue of individual self-assertion,
      which causes them to insist on good elbowroom wherever they gather
      together. Society, however, not being tolerable where the smoothness of
      intercourse is disturbed by a perpetual punching of sides, the merits of
      the free citizen in them become their demerits when a fraternal circle is
      established, and they who have shown an example of civilization too
      notable in one sphere to call for eulogy, are often to be seen elbowing on
      the ragged edge of barbarism in the other. They must therefore be reduced
      to accept laws not of their own making, and of an extreme rigidity.
    </p>
<p>
      Here too is a further peril; for the gallant spirits distinguishing them
      in the state of independence may (he foresaw the melancholy experience of
      a later age) abandon them utterly in subjection, and the glorious
      boisterousness befitting the village green forsake them even in their
      haunts of liberal association, should they once be thoroughly tamed by
      authority. Our ‘merrie England’ will then be long-faced England, an
      England of fallen chaps, like a boar’s head, bearing for speech a lemon in
      the mouth: good to feast on, mayhap; not with!
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish would actually seem to have foreseen the danger of a
      transition that he could watch over only in his time; and, as he said, ‘I
      go, as I came, on a flash’; he had neither ancestry nor descendants: he
      was a genius, he knew himself a solitary, therefore, in spite of his
      efforts to create his like. Within his district he did effect something,
      enough to give him fame as one of the princely fathers of our domestic
      civilization, though we now appear to have lost by it more than formerly
      we gained. The chasing of the natural is ever fraught with dubious
      hazards. If it gallops back, according to the proverb, it will do so at
      the charge: commonly it gallops off, quite off; and then for any kind of
      animation our precarious dependence is upon brains: we have to live on our
      wits, which are ordinarily less productive than land, and cannot be
      remitted in entail.
    </p>
<p>
      Rightly or wrongly (there are differences of opinion about it) Mr. Beamish
      repressed the chthonic natural with a rod of iron beneath his rule. The
      hoyden and the bumpkin had no peace until they had given public imitations
      of the lady and the gentleman; nor were the lady and the gentleman
      privileged to be what he called ‘free flags.’ He could be charitable to
      the passion, but he bellowed the very word itself (hauled up smoking from
      the brimstone lake) against them that pretended to be shamelessly guilty
      of the peccadilloes of gallantry. His famous accost of a lady threatening
      to sink, and already performing like a vessel in that situation: ‘So,
      madam, I hear you are preparing to enrol yourself in the very ancient
      order?’... (he named it) was a piece of insolence that involved him in
      some discord with the lady’s husband and ‘the rascal steward,’ as he chose
      to term the third party in these affairs: yet it is reputed to have saved
      the lady.
    </p>
<p>
      Furthermore, he attacked the vulgarity of persons of quality, and he has
      told a fashionable dame who was indulging herself in a marked sneer of
      disdain, not improving to her features, ‘that he would be pleased to have
      her assurance it was her face she presented to mankind’: a thing—thanks
      perhaps to him chiefly—no longer possible of utterance. One of the
      sex asking him why he addressed his persecutions particularly to women:
      ‘Because I fight your battles,’ says he, ‘and I find you in the ranks of
      the enemy.’ He treated them as traitors.
    </p>
<p>
      He was nevertheless well supported by a sex that compensates for dislike
      of its friend before a certain age by a cordial recognition of him when it
      has touched the period. A phalanx of great dames gave him the terrors of
      Olympus for all except the natively audacious, the truculent and the
      insufferably obtuse; and from the midst of them he launched decree and
      bolt to good effect: not, of course, without receiving return missiles,
      and not without subsequent question whether the work of that man was
      beneficial to the country, who indeed tamed the bumpkin squire and his
      brood, but at the cost of their animal spirits and their gift of speech;
      viz. by making petrifactions of them. In the surgical operation of
      tracheotomy, a successful treatment of the patient hangs, we believe, on
      the promptness and skill of the introduction of the artificial windpipe;
      and it may be that our unhappy countrymen when cut off from the source of
      their breath were not neatly handled; or else that there is a physical
      opposition in them to anything artificial, and it must be nature or
      nothing. The dispute shall be left where it stands.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, to venture upon parading a beautiful young Duchess of Dewlap, with an
      odour of the shepherdess about her notwithstanding her acquired art of
      stepping conformably in a hoop, and to demand full homage of respect for a
      lady bearing such a title, who had the intoxicating attractions of the
      ruddy orchard apple on the tree next the roadside wall, when the owner is
      absent, was bold in Mr. Beamish, passing temerity; nor would even he have
      attempted it had he not been assured of the support of his phalanx of
      great ladies. They indeed, after being taken into the secret, had
      stipulated that first they must have an inspection of the transformed
      dairymaid; and the review was not unfavourable. Duchess Susan came out of
      it more scatheless than her duke. She was tongue-tied, and her tutored
      walking and really admirable stature helped her to appease, the critics of
      her sex; by whom her too readily blushful innocence was praised, with a
      reserve, expressed in the remark, that she was a monstrous fine toy for a
      duke’s second childhood, and should never have been let fly from his
      nursery. Her milliner was approved. The duke was a notorious connoisseur
      of female charms, and would see, of course, to the decorous adornment of
      her person by the best of modistes. Her smiling was pretty, her eyes were
      soft; she might turn out good, if well guarded for a time; but these
      merits of the woman are not those of the great lady, and her title was too
      strong a beam on her character to give it a fair chance with her critics.
      They one and all recommended powder for her hair and cheeks. That odour of
      the shepherdess could be exorcised by no other means, they declared. Her
      blushing was indecent.
    </p>
<p>
      Truly the critics of the foeman sex behaved in a way to cause the blushes
      to swarm rosy as the troops of young Loves round Cytherea in her
      sea-birth, when, some soaring, and sinking some, they flutter like her
      loosened zone, and breast the air thick as flower petals on the summer’s
      breath, weaving her net for the world. Duchess Susan might protest her
      inability to keep her blushes down; that the wrong was done by the
      insolent eyes, and not by her artless cheeks. Ay, but nature, if we are to
      tame these men, must be swathed and concealed, partly stifled, absolutely
      stifled upon occasion. The natural woman does not move a foot without
      striking earth to conjure up the horrid apparition of the natural man, who
      is not as she, but a cannibal savage. To be the light which leads, it is
      her business to don the misty vesture of an idea, that she may dwell as an
      idea in men’s minds, very dim, very powerful, but abstruse, unseizable.
      Much wisdom was imparted to her on the subject, and she understood a
      little, and echoed hollow to the remainder, willing to show entire
      docility as far as her intelligence consented to be awake. She was in that
      stage of the dainty, faintly tinged innocence of the amorousness of
      themselves when beautiful young women who have not been caught for
      schooling in infancy deem it a defilement to be made to appear other than
      the blessed nature has made them, which has made them beautiful, and
      surely therefore deserves to be worshipped. The lectures of the great
      ladies and Chloe’s counsels failed to persuade her to use the powder
      puff-ball. Perhaps too, as timidity quitted her, she enjoyed her
      distinctiveness in their midst.
    </p>
<p>
      But the distinctiveness of a Duchess of Dewlap with the hair and cheeks of
      our native fields, was fraught with troubles outrunning Mr. Beamish’s
      calculations. He had perceived that she would be attractive; he had not
      reckoned on the homogeneousness of her particular English charms. A beauty
      in red, white, and blue is our goddess Venus with the apple of Paris in
      her hand; and after two visits to the Pump Room, and one promenade in the
      walks about the Assembly House, she had as completely divided the ordinary
      guests of the Wells into male and female in opinion as her mother Nature
      had done in it sex. And the men would not be silenced; they had gazed on
      their divinest, and it was for the women to succumb to that unwholesome
      state, so full of thunder. Knights and squires, military and rural, threw
      up their allegiance right and left to devote themselves to this robust new
      vision, and in their peculiar manner, with a general View-halloo, and
      Yoicks, Tally-ho, and away we go, pelt ahead! Unexampled as it is in
      England for Beauty to kindle the ardours of the scent of the fox, Duchess
      Susan did more—she turned all her followers into hounds; they were
      madmen: within a very few days of her entrance bets raged about her, and
      there were brawls, jolly flings at her character in the form of lusty
      encomium, givings of the lie, and upon one occasion a knock-down blow in
      public, as though the place had never known the polishing touch of Mr.
      Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      He was thrown into great perplexity by that blow. Discountenancing the
      duel as much as he could, an affair of the sword was nevertheless more
      tolerable than the brutal fist: and of all men to be guilty of it, who
      would have anticipated the young Alonzo, Chloe’s quiet, modest lover! He
      it was. The case came before Mr. Beamish for his decision; he had to
      pronounce an impartial judgement, and for some time, during the
      examination of evidence, he suffered, as he assures us in his Memoirs, a
      royal agony. To have to strike with the glaive of Justice them whom they
      most esteem, is the greatest affliction known to kings. He would have done
      it: he deserved to reign. Happily the evidence against the gentleman who
      was tumbled, Mr. Ralph Shepster, excused Mr. Augustus Camwell, otherwise
      Alonzo, for dealing with him promptly to shut his mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      This Shepster, a raw young squire, ‘reeking,’ Beau Beamish writes of him,
      ‘one half of the soil, and t’ other half of the town,’ had involved Chloe
      in his familiar remarks upon the Duchess of Dewlap; and the personal
      respect entertained by Mr. Beamish for Chloe so strongly approved Alonzo’s
      championship of her, that in giving judgement he laid stress on young
      Alonzo’s passion for Chloe, to prove at once the disinterestedness of the
      assailant, and the judicial nature of the sentence: which was, that Mr.
      Ralph Shepster should undergo banishment, and had the right to demand
      reparation. The latter part of this decree assisted in effecting the
      execution of the former. Shepster declined cold steel, calling it murder,
      and was effusive of nature’s logic on the subject.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because a man comes and knocks me down, I’m to go up to him and ask him
      to run me through!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      His shake of the head signified that he was not such a noodle. Voluble and
      prolific of illustration, as is no one so much as a son of nature inspired
      to speak her words of wisdom, he defied the mandate, and refused himself
      satisfaction, until in the strangest manner possible flights of white
      feathers beset him, and he became a mark for persecution too trying for
      the friendship of his friends. He fled, repeating his tale, that he had
      seen ‘Beamish’s Duchess,’ and Chloe attending her, at an assignation in
      the South Grove, where a gentleman, unknown to the Wells, presented
      himself to the adventurous ladies, and they walked together—a tale
      ending with nods.
    </p>
<p>
      Shepster’s banishment was one of those victories of justice upon which
      mankind might be congratulated if they left no commotion behind. But, as
      when a boy has been horsed before his comrades, dread may visit them, yet
      is there likewise devilry in the school; and everywhere over earth a
      summary punishment that does not sweep the place clear is likely to infect
      whom it leaves remaining. The great law-givers, Lycurgus, Draco, Solon,
      Beamish, sorrowfully acknowledge that they have had recourse to infernal
      agents, after they have thus purified their circle of an offender. Doctors
      confess to the same of their physic. The expelling agency has next to be
      expelled, and it is a subtle poison, affecting our spirits. Duchess Susan
      had now the incense of a victim to heighten her charms; like the
      treasure-laden Spanish galleon for whom, on her voyage home from South
      American waters, our enterprising light-craft privateers lay in wait, she
      had the double attraction of being desirable and an enemy. To watch above
      her conscientiously was a harassing business.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish sent for Chloe, and she came to him at once. Her look was
      curious; he studied it while they conversed. So looks one who is watching
      the sure flight of an arrow, or the happy combinations of an intrigue.
      Saying, ‘I am no inquisitor, child,’ he ventured upon two or three modest
      inquisitions with regard to her mistress. The title he had disguised
      Duchess Susan in, he confessed to rueing as the principal cause of the
      agitation of his principality. ‘She is courted,’ he said, ‘less like a
      citadel waving a flag than a hostelry where the demand is for sitting room
      and a tankard! These be our manners. Yet, I must own, a Duchess of Dewlap
      is a provocation, and my exclusive desire to protect the name of my lord
      stands corrected by the perils environing his lady. She is other than I
      supposed her; she is, we will hope, an excellent good creature, but too
      attractive for most and drawbridge and the customary defences to be
      neglected.
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe met his interrogatory with a ready report of the young duchess’s
      innocence and good nature that pacified Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you?’ said he.
    </p>
<p>
      She smiled for answer.
    </p>
<p>
      That smile was not the common smile; it was one of an eager exultingness,
      producing as he gazed the twitch of an inquisitive reflection of it on his
      lips. Such a smile bids us guess and quickens us to guess, warns us we
      burn and speeds our burning, and so, like an angel wafting us to some
      heaven-feasting promontory, lifts us out of ourselves to see in the
      universe of colour what the mouth has but pallid speech to tell. That is
      the very heart’s language; the years are in a look, as mount and vale of
      the dark land spring up in lightning.
    </p>
<p>
      He checked himself: he scarce dared to say it.
    </p>
<p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have seen the man, Chloe?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her smiling broke up in the hard lines of an ecstasy neighbouring pain.
      ‘He has come; he is here; he is faithful; he has not forgotten me. I was
      right. I knew! I knew!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Caseldy has come?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He has come. Do not ask. To have him! to see him! Mr. Beamish, he is
      here.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘At last!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Cruel!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, Caseldy has come, then! But now, friend Chloe, you should be made
      aware that the man—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She stopped her ears. As she did so, Mr. Beamish observed a thick silken
      skein dangling from one hand. Part of it was plaited, and at the upper end
      there was a knot. It resembled the commencement of her manufactory of a
      whip: she swayed it to and fro, allowing him to catch and lift the threads
      on his fingers for the purpose of examining her work. There was no special
      compliment to pay, so he dropped it without remark.
    </p>
<p>
      Their faces had expressed her wish to hear nothing from him of Caseldy and
      his submission to say nothing. Her happiness was too big; she appeared to
      beg to lie down with it on her bosom, in the manner of an outworn, young
      mother who has now first received her infant in her arms from the nurse.

<h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
<p>
      Humouring Chloe with his usual considerateness, Mr. Beamish forbore to
      cast a shadow on her new-born joy, and even within himself to doubt the
      security of its foundation. Caseldy’s return to the Wells was at least
      some assurance of his constancy, seeing that here they appointed to meet
      when he and Chloe last parted. All might be well, though it was
      unexplained why he had not presented himself earlier. To the lightest
      inquiry Chloe’s reply was a shiver of happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, Mr. Beamish calculated that Caseldy would be a serviceable ally
      in commanding a proper respect for her Grace the Duchess of Dewlap. So he
      betook himself cheerfully to Caseldy’s lodgings to deliver a message of
      welcome, meeting, on his way thither, Mr. Augustus Camwell, with whom he
      had a short conversation, greatly to his admiration of the enamoured young
      gentleman’s goodness and self-compression in speaking of Caseldy and
      Chloe’s better fortune. Mr. Camwell seemed hurried.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy was not at home, and Mr. Beamish proceeded to the lodgings of the
      duchess. Chloe had found her absent. The two consulted. Mr. Beamish put on
      a serious air, until Chloe mentioned the pastrycook’s shop, for Duchess
      Susan had a sweet tooth; she loved a visit to the pastrycook’s, whose jam
      tarts were dearer to her than his more famous hot mutton pies. The pastry
      cook informed Mr. Beamish that her Grace had been in his shop, earlier
      than usual, as it happened, and accompanied by a foreign-looking gentleman
      wearing moustachois. Her Grace, the pastrycook said, had partaken of
      several tarts, in common with the gentleman, who complimented him upon his
      excelling the Continental confectioner. Mr. Beamish glanced at Chloe. He
      pursued his researches down at the Pump Room, while she looked round the
      ladies’ coffee house. Encountering again, they walked back to the
      duchess’s lodgings, where a band stood playing in the road, by order of
      her Grace; but the duchess was away, and had not been seen since her
      morning’s departure.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What sort of character would you give mistress Susan of Dewlap, from your
      personal acquaintance with it?’ said Mr. Beamish to Chloe, as they stepped
      from the door.
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe mused and said, ‘I would add “good” to the unkindest comparison you
      could find for her.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But accepting the comparison!’ Mr. Beamish nodded, and revolved upon the
      circumstance of their being very much in nature’s hands with Duchess
      Susan, of whom it might be said that her character was good, yet all the
      more alive to the temptations besetting the Spring season. He allied
      Chloe’s adjective to a number of epithets equally applicable to nature and
      to women, according to current ideas, concluding: ‘Count, they call your
      Caseldy at his lodgings. “The Count he is out for an airing.” He is
      counted out. Ah! you will make him drop that “Count” when he takes you
      from here.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do not speak of the time beyond the month,’ said Chloe, so urgently on a
      rapid breath as to cause Mr. Beamish to cast an inquiring look at her.
    </p>
<p>
      She answered it, ‘Is not one month of brightness as much as we can ask
      for?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The beau clapped his elbows complacently to his sides in philosophical
      concord with her sentiment.
    </p>
<p>
      In the afternoon, on the parade, they were joined by Mr. Camwell, among
      groups of fashionable ladies and their escorts, pacing serenely, by
      medical prescription, for an appetite. As he did not comment on the
      absence of the duchess, Mr. Beamish alluded to it; whereupon he was
      informed that she was about the meadows, and had been there for some
      hours.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not unguarded,’ he replied to Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aha!’ quoth the latter; ‘we have an Argus!’ and as the duchess was not on
      the heights, and the sun’s rays were mild in cloud, he agreed to his young
      friend’s proposal that they should advance to meet her. Chloe walked with
      them, but her face was disdainful; at the stiles she gave her hand to Mr.
      Beamish; she did not address a word to Mr. Camwell, and he knew the
      reason. Nevertheless he maintained his air of soldierly resignation to the
      performance of duty, and held his head like a gentleman unable to conceive
      the ignominy of having played spy. Chloe shrank from him.
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan was distinguished coming across a broad uncut meadow,
      tirra-lirraing beneath a lark, Caseldy in attendance on her. She stopped
      short and spoke to him; then came forward, crying ingenuously. ‘Oh, Mr.
      Beamish, isn’t this just what you wanted me to do?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, madam,’ said he, ‘you had my injunctions to the contrary.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘La!’ she exclaimed, ‘I thought I was to run about in the fields now and
      then to preserve my simplicity. I know I was told so, and who told me!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish bowed effusively to the introduction of Caseldy, whose fingers
      he touched in sign of the renewal of acquaintance, and with a laugh
      addressed the duchess:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Madam, you remind me of a tale of my infancy. I had a juvenile comrade of
      the tenderest age, by name Tommy Plumston, and he enjoyed the privilege of
      intimacy with a component urchin yclept Jimmy Clungeon, with which
      adventurous roamer, in defiance of his mother’s interdict against his
      leaving the house for a minute during her absence from home, he departed
      on a tour of the district, resulting, perhaps as a consequence of its
      completeness, in this, that at a distance computed at four miles from the
      maternal mansion, he perceived his beloved mama with sufficient clearness
      to feel sure that she likewise had seen him. Tommy consulted with Jimmy,
      and then he sprang forward on a run to his frowning mama, and delivered
      himself in these artless words, which I repeat as they were uttered, to
      give you the flavour of the innocent babe: he said, “I frink I frought I
      hear you call me, ma! and Jimmy Clungeon, he frought he frink so too!” So,
      you see, the pair of them were under the impression that they were doing
      right. There is a delicate distinction in the tenses of each frinking
      where the other frought, enough in itself to stamp sincerity upon the
      statement.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy said, ‘The veracity of a boy possessing a friend named Clungeon is
      beyond contest.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan opened her eyes. ‘Four miles from home! And what did his
      mother do to him?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tommy’s mama,’ said Mr. Beamish, and with the resplendent licence of the
      period which continued still upon tolerable terms with nature under the
      compromise of decorous ‘Oh-fie!’ flatly declared the thing she did.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I fancy, sir, that I caught sight of your figure on the hill yonder about
      an hour or so earlier,’ said Caseldy to Mr. Camwell.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If it was at the time when you were issuing from that wood, sir, your
      surmise is correct,’ said the young gentleman.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are long-sighted, sir!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am, sir.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And so am I.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And I,’ said Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Our Chloe will distinguish you accurately at a mile, and has done it,’ 
      observed Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One guesses tiptoe on a suspicion, and if one is wrong it passes, and if
      one is right it is a miracle,’ she said, and raised her voice on a song to
      quit the subject.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, ay, Chloe; so then you had a suspicion, you rogue, the day we had the
      pleasure of meeting the duchess, had you?’ Mr. Beamish persisted.
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan interposed. ‘Such a pretty song! and you to stop her, sir!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy took up the air.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, you two together!’ she cried. ‘I do love hearing music in the fields;
      it is heavenly. Bands in the town and voices in the green fields, I say!
      Couldn’t you join Chloe, Mr.... Count, sir, before we come among the
      people, here where it ‘s all so nice and still. Music! and my heart does
      begin so to pit-a-pat. Do you sing, Mr. Alonzo?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poorly,’ the young gentleman replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But the Count can sing, and Chloe’s a real angel when she sings; and
      won’t you, dear?’ she implored Chloe, to whom Caseldy addressed a prelude
      with a bow and a flourish of the hand.
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe’s voice flew forth. Caseldy’s rich masculine matched it. The song
      was gay; he snapped his finger at intervals in foreign style, singing
      big-chested, with full notes and a fine abandonment, and the quickest
      susceptibility to his fair companion’s cunning modulations, and an eye for
      Duchess Susan’s rapture.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish and Mr. Camwell applauded them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I never can tell what to say when I’m brimming’; the duchess let fall a
      sigh. ‘And he can play the flute, Mr. Beamish. He promised me he would go
      into the orchestra and play a bit at one of your nice evening delicious
      concerts, and that will be nice—Oh!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He promised you, madam, did he so?’ said the beau. ‘Was it on your way to
      the Wells that he promised you?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On my way to the Wells!’ she exclaimed softly. ‘Why, how could anybody
      promise me a thing before ever he saw me? I call that a strange thing to
      ask a person. No, to-day, while we were promenading; and I should hear him
      sing, he said. He does admire his Chloe so. Why, no wonder, is it, now?
      She can do everything; knit, sew, sing, dance—and talk! She’s never
      uneasy for a word. She makes whole scenes of things go round you, like a
      picture peep-show, I tell her. And always cheerful. She hasn’t a minute of
      grumps; and I’m sometimes a dish of stale milk fit only for pigs.
    </p>
<p>
      With your late hours here, I’m sure I want tickling in the morning, and
      Chloe carols me one of her songs, and I say, “There’s my bird!”’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish added, ‘And you will remember she has a heart.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I should think so!’ said the duchess.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A heart, madam!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, what else?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing other, the beau, by his aspect, was constrained to admit.
    </p>
<p>
      He appeared puzzled by this daughter of nature in a coronet; and more on
      her remarking, ‘You know about her heart, Mr. Beamish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He acquiesced, for of course he knew of her life-long devotion to Caseldy;
      but there was archness in her tone. However, he did not expect a woman of
      her education to have the tone perfectly concordant with the
      circumstances. Speaking tentatively of Caseldy’s handsome face and figure,
      he was pleased to hear the duchess say, ‘So I tell Chloe.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said he, ‘we must consider them united; they are one.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan replied, ‘That’s what I tell him; she will do anything you
      wish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He repeated these words with an interjection, and decided in his mind that
      they were merely silly. She was a real shepherdess by birth and nature,
      requiring a strong guard over her attractions on account of her
      simplicity; such was his reading of the problem; he had conceived it at
      the first sight of her, and always recurred to it under the influence of
      her artless eyes, though his theories upon men and women were astute, and
      that cavalier perceived by long-sighted Chloe at Duchess Susan’s coach
      window perturbed him at whiles. Habitually to be anticipating the
      simpleton in a particular person is the sure way of being sometimes the
      dupe, as he would not have been the last to warn a neophyte; but abstract
      wisdom is in need of an unappeased suspicion of much keenness of edge, if
      we would have it alive to cope with artless eyes and our prepossessed
      fancy of their artlessness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You talk of Chloe to him?’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      She answered. ‘Yes, that I do. And he does love her! I like to hear him.
      He is one of the gentlemen who don’t make me feel timid with them.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She received a short lecture on the virtues of timidity in preserving the
      sex from danger; after which, considering that the lady who does not feel
      timid with a particular cavalier has had no sentiment awakened, he
      relinquished his place to Mr. Camwell, and proceeded to administer the
      probe to Caseldy.
    </p>
<p>
      That gentleman was communicatively candid. Chloe had left him, and he
      related how, summoned home to England and compelled to settle a dispute
      threatening a lawsuit, he had regretfully to abstain from visiting the
      Wells for a season, not because of any fear of the attractions of play—he
      had subdued the frailty of the desire to play—but because he deemed
      it due to his Chloe to bring her an untroubled face, and he wished first
      to be the better of the serious annoyances besetting him. For some similar
      reason he had not written; he wished to feast on her surprise. ‘And I had
      my reward,’ he said, as if he had been the person principally to suffer
      through that abstinence. ‘I found—I may say it to you, Mr. Beamish
      love in her eyes. Divine by nature, she is one of the immortals, both in
      appearance and in steadfastness.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      They referred to Duchess Susan. Caseldy reluctantly owned that it would be
      an unkindness to remove Chloe from attendance on her during the short
      remaining term of her stay at the Wells; and so he had not proposed it, he
      said, for the duchess was a child, an innocent, not stupid by any means;
      but, of course, her transplanting from an inferior to an exalted position
      put her under disadvantages.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish spoke of the difficulties of his post as guardian, and also of
      the strange cavalier seen at her carriage window by Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy smiled and said, ‘If there was one—and Chloe is rather long—sighted—we
      can hardly expect her to confess it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not, sir, if she be this piece of innocence?’ Mr. Beamish was led to
      inquire.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She fears you, sir,’ Caseldy answered. ‘You have inspired her with an
      extraordinary fear of you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have?’ said the beau: it had been his endeavour to inspire it, and he
      swelled somewhat, rather with relief at the thought of his possessing a
      power to control his delicate charge, than with our vanity; yet would it
      be audacious to say that there was not a dose of the latter. He was a very
      human man; and he had, as we have seen, his ideas of the effect of the
      impression of fear upon the hearts of women. Something, in any case,
      caused him to forget the cavalier.
    </p>
<p>
      They were drawn to the three preceding them, by a lively dissension
      between Chloe and Mr. Camwell.
    </p>
<p>
      Duchess Susan explained it in her blunt style: ‘She wants him to go away
      home, and he says he will, if she’ll give him that double skein of silk
      she swings about, and she says she won’t, let him ask as long as he
      pleases; so he says he sha’n’t go, and I’m sure I don’t see why he should;
      and she says he may stay, but he sha’n’t have her necklace, she calls it.
      So Mr. Camwell snatches, and Chloe fires up. Gracious, can’t she frown!—at
      him. She never frowns at anybody but him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy attempted persuasion on Mr. Camwell’s behalf. With his mouth at
      Chloe’s ear, he said, ‘Give it; let the poor fellow have his memento;
      despatch him with it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can hear! and that is really kind,’ exclaimed Duchess Susan.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rather a missy-missy schoolgirl sort of necklace,’ Mr. Beamish observed;
      ‘but he might have it, without the dismissal, for I cannot consent to lose
      Alonzo. No, madam,’ he nodded at the duchess.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy continued his whisper: ‘You can’t think of wearing a thing like
      that about your neck?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Indeed,’ said Chloe, ‘I think of it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, what fashion have you over here?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is not yet a fashion,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A silken circlet will not well become any precious pendant that I know
      of.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A bag of dust is not a very precious pendant,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, a memento mori!’ cried he.
    </p>
<p>
      And she answered, ‘Yes.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He rallied her for her superstition, pursuing, ‘Surely, my love, ‘tis a
      cheap riddance of a pestilent, intrusive jaloux. Whip it into his hands
      for a mittimus.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Does his presence distress you?’ she asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will own that to be always having the fellow dogging us, with his
      dejected leer, is not agreeable. He watches us now, because my lips are
      close by your cheek. He should be absent; he is one too many. Speed him on
      his voyage with the souvenir he asks for.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I keep it for a journey of my own, which I may have to take,’ said Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With me?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will follow; you cannot help following me, Caseldy.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He speculated on her front. She was tenderly smiling. ‘You are happy,
      Chloe?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have never known such happiness,’ she said. The brilliancy of her eyes
      confirmed it.
    </p>
<p>
      He glanced over at Duchess Susan, who was like a sunflower in the sun. His
      glance lingered a moment. Her abundant and glowing young charms were the
      richest fascination an eye like his could dwell on. ‘That is right,’ said
      he. ‘We will be perfectly happy till the month ends. And after it? But get
      us rid of Monsieur le Jeune; toss him that trifle; I spare him that.
      ‘Twill be bliss to him, at the cost of a bit of silk thread to us.
      Besides, if we keep him to cure him of his passion here, might it not be—these
      boys veer suddenly, like the winds of Albion, from one fair object to t’ 
      other—at the cost of the precious and simple lady you are guarding?
      I merely hint. These two affect one another, as though it could be. She
      speaks of him. It shall be as you please, but a trifle like that, my
      Chloe, to be rid of a green eye!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You much wish him gone?’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      He shrugged. ‘The fellow is in our way.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You think him a little perilous for my innocent lady?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Candidly, I do.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She stretched the half-plaited silken rope in her two hands to try the
      strength of it, made a second knot, and consigned it to her pocket.
    </p>
<p>
      At once she wore her liveliest playfellow air, in which character no one
      was so enchanting as Chloe could be, for she became the comrade of men
      without forfeit of her station among sage sweet ladies, and was like a
      well-mannered sparkling boy, to whom his admiring seniors have given the
      lead in sallies, whims, and fights; but pleasanter than a boy, the soft
      hues of her sex toned her frolic spirit; she seemed her sex’s deputy, to
      tell the coarser where they could meet, as on a bridge above the torrent
      separating them, gaily for interchange of the best of either, unfired and
      untempted by fire, yet with all the elements which make fire burn to
      animate their hearts.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lucky the man who wins for himself that life-long cordial!’ Mr. Beamish
      said to Duchess Susan.
    </p>
<p>
      She had small comprehension of metaphorical phrases, but she was quick at
      reading faces; and comparing the enthusiasm on the face of the beau with
      Caseldy’s look of troubled wonderment and regret, she pitied the lover
      conscious of not having the larger share of his mistress’s affections.
      When presently he looked at her, the tender-hearted woman could have cried
      for very compassion, so sensible did he show himself of Chloe’s preference
      of the other.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<p>
      That evening Duchess Susan played at the Pharaoh table and lost eight
      hundred pounds, through desperation at the loss of twenty. After
      encouraging her to proceed to this extremity, Caseldy checked her. He was
      conducting her out of the Play room when a couple of young squires of the
      Shepster order, and primed with wine, intercepted her to present their
      condolences, which they performed with exaggerated gestures, intended for
      broad mimicry of the courtliness imported from the Continent, and a very
      dulcet harping on the popular variations of her Christian name, not
      forgetting her singular title, ‘my lovely, lovely Dewlap!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She was excited and stunned by her immediate experience in the transfer of
      money, and she said, ‘I ‘m sure I don’t know what you want.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes!’ cried they, striking their bosoms as guitars, and attempting the
      posture of the thrummer on the instrument; ‘she knows. She does know.
      Handsome Susie knows what we want.’ And one ejaculated, mellifluously,
      ‘Oh!’ and the other ‘Ah!’ in flagrant derision of the foreign ways they
      produced in boorish burlesque—a self-consolatory and a common trick
      of the boor.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy was behind. He pushed forward and bowed to them. ‘Sirs, will you
      mention to me what you want?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He said it with a look that meant steel. It cooled them sufficiently to
      let him place the duchess under the protectorship of Mr. Beamish, then
      entering from another room with Chloe; whereupon the pair of rustic bucks
      retired to reinvigorate their valiant blood.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish had seen that there was cause for gratitude to Caseldy, to
      whom he said, ‘She has lost?’ and he seemed satisfied on hearing the
      amount of the loss, and commissioned Caseldy to escort the ladies to their
      lodgings at once, observing, ‘Adieu, Count!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will find my foreign title of use to you here, after a bout or two,’ 
      was the reply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No bouts, if possibly to be avoided; though I perceive how the flavour of
      your countship may spread a wholesome alarm among our rurals, who will
      readily have at you with fists, but relish not the tricky cold weapon.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish haughtily bowed the duchess away.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy seized the opportunity while handing her into her sedan to say,
      ‘We will try the fortune-teller for a lucky day to have our revenge.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She answered: ‘Oh, don’t talk to me about playing again ever; I’m nigh on
      a clean pocket, and never knew such a sinful place as this. I feel I’ve
      tumbled into a ditch. And there’s Mr. Beamish, all top when he bows to me.
      You’re keeping Chloe waiting, sir.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where was she while we were at the table?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sure she was with Mr. Beamish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ he groaned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The poor soul is in despair over her losses to-night,’ he turned from the
      boxed-up duchess to remark to Chloe. ‘Give her a comfortable cry and a few
      moral maxims.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will,’ she said. ‘You love me, Caseldy?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Love you? I? Your own? What assurance would you have?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘None, dear friend.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Here was a woman easily deceived.
    </p>
<p>
      In the hearts of certain men, owing to an intellectual contempt of easy
      dupes, compunction in deceiving is diminished by the lightness of their
      task; and that soft confidence which will often, if but passingly, bid
      betrayers reconsider the charms of the fair soul they are abandoning,
      commends these armoured knights to pursue with redoubled earnest the
      fruitful ways of treachery. Their feelings are warm for their prey,
      moreover; and choosing to judge their victim by the present warmth of
      their feelings, they can at will be hurt, even to being scandalized, by a
      coldness that does not waken one suspicion of them. Jealousy would have a
      chance of arresting, for it is not impossible to tease them back to avowed
      allegiance; but sheer indifference also has a stronger hold on them than
      a, dull, blind trustfulness. They hate the burden it imposes; the blind
      aspect is only touching enough to remind them of the burden, and they hate
      if for that, and for the enormous presumption of the belief that they are
      everlastingly bound to such an imbecile. She walks about with her eyes
      shut, expecting not to stumble, and when she does, am I to blame? The
      injured man asks it in the course of his reasoning.
    </p>
<p>
      He recurs to his victim’s merits, but only compassionately, and the
      compassion is chilled by the thought that she may in the end start across
      his path to thwart him. Thereat he is drawn to think of the prize she may
      rob him of; and when one woman is an obstacle, the other shines desirable
      as life beyond death; he must have her; he sees her in the hue of his
      desire for her, and the obstacle in that of his repulsion. Cruelty is no
      more than the man’s effort to win the wished object.
    </p>
<p>
      She should not leave it to his imagination to conceive that in the end the
      blind may awaken to thwart him. Better for her to cast him hence, or let
      him know that she will do battle to keep him. But the pride of a love that
      has hardened in the faithfulness of love cannot always be wise on trial.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy walked considerably in the rear of the couple of chairs. He saw on
      his way what was coming. His two young squires were posted at Duchess
      Susan’s door when she arrived, and he received a blow from one of them in
      clearing a way for her. She plucked at his hand. ‘Have they hurt you?’ she
      asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Think of me to-night thanking them and heaven for this, my darling,’ he
      replied, with a pressure that lit the flying moment to kindle the after
      hours.
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe had taken help of one of her bearers to jump out. She stretched a
      finger at the unruly intruders, crying sternly, ‘There is blood on you—come
      not nigh me!’ The loftiest harangue would not have been so cunning to
      touch their wits. They stared at one another in the clear moonlight. Which
      of them had blood on him? As they had not been for blood, but for rough
      fun, and something to boast of next day, they gesticulated according to
      the first instructions of the dancing master, by way of gallantry, and
      were out of Caseldy’s path when he placed himself at his liege lady’s
      service. ‘Take no notice of them, dear,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, no,’ said he; and ‘What is it?’ and his hoarse accent and shaking
      clasp of her arm sickened her to the sensation of approaching death.
    </p>
<p>
      Upstairs Duchess Susan made a show of embracing her. Both were trembling.
      The duchess ascribed her condition to those dreadful men. ‘What makes them
      be at me so?’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      And Chloe said, ‘Because you are beautiful.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Am I?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Very beautiful; young and beautiful; beautiful in the bud. You will learn
      to excuse them, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But, Chloe—’ The duchess shut her mouth. Out of a languid reverie,
      she sighed: ‘I suppose I must be! My duke—oh, don’t talk of him.
      Dear man! he’s in bed and fast asleep long before this. I wonder how he
      came to let me come here.
    </p>
<p>
      I did bother him, I know. Am I very, very beautiful, Chloe, so that men
      can’t help themselves?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Very, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There, good-night. I want to be in bed, and I can’t kiss you because you
      keep calling me madam, and freeze me to icicles; but I do love you,
      Chloe.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am sure you do.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m quite certain I do. I know I never mean harm. But how are we women
      expected to behave, then? Oh, I’m unhappy, I am.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You must abstain from playing.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s that! I’ve lost my money—I forgot. And I shall have to confess
      it to my duke, though he warned me. Old men hold their fingers up—so!
      One finger: and you never forget the sight of it, never. It’s a round
      finger, like the handle of a jug, and won’t point at you when they’re
      lecturing, and the skin’s like an old coat on gaffer’s shoulders—or,
      Chloe! just like, when you look at the nail, a rumpled counterpane up to
      the face of a corpse. I declare, it’s just like! I feel as if I didn’t a
      bit mind talking of corpses tonight. And my money’s gone, and I don’t much
      mind. I’m a wild girl again, handsomer than when that——he is a
      dear, kind, good old nobleman, with his funny old finger: “Susan! Susan!”
       I’m no worse than others. Everybody plays here; everybody superior. Why,
      you have played, Chloe.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ve heard you say you played once, and a bigger stake it was, you said,
      than anybody ever did play.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not money.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What then?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My life.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Goodness—yes! I understand. I understand everything to-night-men
      too. So you did!—They’re not so shamefully wicked, Chloe. Because I
      can’t see the wrong of human nature—if we’re discreet, I mean. Now
      and then a country dance and a game, and home to bed and dreams. There’s
      no harm in that, I vow. And that’s why you stayed at this place. You like
      it, Chloe?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am used to it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But when you’re married to Count Caseldy you’ll go?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, then.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She uttered it so joylessly that Duchess Susan added, with intense
      affectionateness, ‘You’re not obliged to marry him, dear Chloe.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nor he me, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The duchess caught at her impulsively to kiss her, and said she would
      undress herself, as she wished to be alone.
    </p>
<p>
      From that night she was a creature inflamed.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
<p>
      The total disappearance of the pair of heroes who had been the latest in
      the conspiracy to vex his delicate charge, gave Mr. Beamish a high opinion
      of Caseldy as an assistant in such an office as he held. They had gone,
      and nothing more was heard of them. Caseldy confined his observations on
      the subject to the remark that he had employed the best means to be rid of
      that kind of worthies; and whether their souls had fled, or only their
      bodies, was unknown. But the duchess had quiet promenades with Caseldy to
      guard her, while Mr. Beamish counted the remaining days of her visit with
      the impatience of a man having cause to cast eye on a clock. For Duchess
      Susan was not very manageable now; she had fits of insurgency, and plainly
      said that her time was short, and she meant to do as she liked, go where
      she liked, play when she liked, and be an independent woman—if she
      was so soon to be taken away and boxed in a castle that was only a bigger
      sedan.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy protested he was as helpless as the beau. He described the
      annoyance of his incessant running about at her heels in all directions
      amusingly, and suggested that she must be beating the district to recover
      her ‘strange cavalier,’ of whom, or of one that had ridden beside her
      carriage half a day on her journey to the Wells, he said she had dropped a
      sort of hint. He complained of the impossibility of his getting an hour in
      privacy with his Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And I, accustomed to consult with her, see too little of her,’ said Mr.
      Beamish. ‘I shall presently be seeing nothing, and already I am sensible
      of my loss.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He represented his case to Duchess Susan:—that she was for ever
      driving out long distances and taking Chloe from him, when his occupation
      precluded his accompanying them; and as Chloe soon was to be lost to him
      for good, he deeply felt her absence.
    </p>
<p>
      The duchess flung him enigmatical rejoinders: ‘You can change all that,
      Mr. Beamish, if you like, and you know you can. Oh, yes, you can. But you
      like being a butterfly, and when you’ve made ladies pale you’re happy: and
      there they’re to stick and wither for you. Never!—I’ve that pride. I
      may be worried, but I’ll never sink to green and melancholy for a man.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She bridled at herself in a mirror, wherein not a sign of paleness was
      reflected.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish meditated, and he thought it prudent to speak to Caseldy
      manfully of her childish suspicions, lest she should perchance in like
      manner perturb the lover’s mind.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, make your mind easy, my dear sir, as far as I am concerned,’ said
      Caseldy. ‘But, to tell you the truth, I think I can interpret her creamy
      ladyship’s innuendos a little differently and quite as clearly. For my
      part, I prefer the pale to the blowsy, and I stake my right hand on
      Chloe’s fidelity. Whatever harm I may have the senseless cruelty—misfortune,
      I may rather call it—to do that heavenly-minded woman in our days to
      come, none shall say of me that I was ever for an instant guilty of the
      baseness of doubting her purity and constancy. And, sir, I will add that I
      could perfectly rely also on your honour.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish bowed. ‘You do but do me justice. But, say, what
      interpretation?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She began by fearing you,’ said Caseldy, creating a stare that was
      followed by a frown. ‘She fancies you neglect her. Perhaps she has a
      woman’s suspicion that you do it to try her.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish frenetically cited his many occupations. ‘How can I be ever
      dancing attendance on her?’ Then he said, ‘Pooh,’ and tenderly fingered
      the ruffles of his wrist. ‘Tush, tush,’ said he, ‘no, no: though if it
      came to a struggle between us, I might in the interests of my old friend,
      her lord, whom I have reasons for esteeming, interpose an influence that
      would make the exercise of my authority agreeable. Hitherto I have seen no
      actual need of it, and I watch keenly. Her eye has been on Colonel
      Poltermore once or twice his on her. The woman is a rose in June, sir, and
      I forgive the whole world for looking—and for longing too. But I
      have observed nothing serious.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He is of our party to the beacon-head to-morrow,’ said Caseldy. ‘She
      insisted that she would have him; and at least it will grant me furlough
      for an hour.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do me the service to report to me,’ said Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      In this fashion he engaged Caseldy to supply him with inventions, and
      prepared himself to swallow them. It was Poltermore and Poltermore, the
      Colonel here, the Colonel there until the chase grew so hot that Mr.
      Beamish could no longer listen to young Mr. Camwell’s fatiguing drone upon
      his one theme of the double-dealing of Chloe’s betrothed. He became of her
      way of thinking, and treated the young gentleman almost as coldly as she.
      In time he was ready to guess of his own acuteness that the ‘strange
      cavalier’ could have been no other than Colonel Poltermore. When Caseldy
      hinted it, Mr. Beamish said, ‘I have marked him.’ He added, in highly
      self-satisfied style, ‘With all your foreign training, my friend, you will
      learn that we English are not so far behind you in the art of unravelling
      an intrigue in the dark.’ To which Caseldy replied, that the Continental
      world had little to teach Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      Poor Colonel Poltermore, as he came to be called, was clearly a victim of
      the sudden affability of Duchess Susan. The transformation of a stiff
      military officer into a nimble Puck, a runner of errands and a sprightly
      attendant, could not pass without notice. The first effect of her
      discriminating condescension on this unfortunate gentleman was to make him
      the champion of her claims to breeding. She had it by nature, she was
      Nature’s great lady, he would protest to the noble dames of the circle he
      moved in; and they admitted that she was different in every way from a
      bourgeoise elevated by marriage to lofty rank: she was not vulgar. But
      they remained doubtful of the perfect simplicity of a young woman who
      worked such changes in men as to render one of the famous conquerors of
      the day her agitated humble servant. By rapid degrees the Colonel had
      fallen to that. When not by her side, he was ever marching with sharp
      strides, hurrying through rooms and down alleys and groves until he had
      discovered and attached himself to her skirts. And, curiously, the object
      of his jealousy was the devoted Alonzo! Mr. Beamish laughed when he heard
      of it. The lady’s excitement and giddy mien, however, accused Poltermore
      of a stage of success requiring to be combated immediately. There was
      mention of Duchess Susan’s mighty wish to pay a visit to the popular
      fortune-teller of the hut on the heath, and Mr. Beamish put his veto on
      the expedition. She had obeyed him by abstaining from play of late, so he
      fully expected, that his interdict would be obeyed; and besides the
      fortune-teller was a rogue of a sham astrologer known to have foretold to
      certain tender ladies things they were only too desirous to imagine
      predestined by an extraordinary indication of the course of planets
      through the zodiac, thus causing them to sin by the example of celestial
      conjunctions—a piece of wanton impiety. The beau took high ground in
      his objections to the adventure. Nevertheless, Duchess Susan did go. She
      drove to the heath at an early hour of the morning, attended by Chloe,
      Colonel Poltermore, and Caseldy. They subsequently breakfasted at an inn
      where gipsy repasts were occasionally served to the fashion, and they were
      back at the wells as soon as the world was abroad. Their surprise then was
      prodigious when Mr. Beamish, accosting them full in assembly, inquired
      whether they were satisfied with the report of their fortunes, and yet
      more when he positively proved himself acquainted with the fortunes which
      had been recounted to each of them in privacy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You, Colonel Poltermore, are to be in luck’s way up to the tenth
      milestone,—where your chariot will overset and you will be lamed for
      life.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not quite so bad,’ said the Colonel cheerfully, he having been informed
      of much better.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you, Count Caseldy, are to have it all your own way with good luck,
      after committing a deed of slaughter, with the solitary penalty of
      undergoing a visit every night from the corpse.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ghost,’ Caseldy smilingly corrected him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And Chloe would not have her fortune told, because she knew it!’ Mr.
      Beamish cast a paternal glance at her. ‘And you, madam,’ he bent his brows
      on the duchess, ‘received the communication that “All for Love” will sink
      you as it raised you, put you down as it took you up, furnish the feast to
      the raven gentleman which belongs of right to the golden eagle?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing of the sort! And I don’t believe in any of their stories,’ cried
      the duchess, with a burning face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You deny it, madam?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do. There was never a word of a raven or an eagle, that I’ll swear,
      now.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You deny that there was ever a word of “All for Love”? Speak, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Their conjuror’s rigmarole!’ she murmured, huffing. ‘As if I listened to
      their nonsense!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Does the Duchess of Dewlap dare to give me the lie?’ said Mr. Beamish.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s not my title, and you know it,’ she retorted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What’s this?’ the angry beau sang out. ‘What stuff is this you wear?’ He
      towered and laid hand on a border of lace of her morning dress, tore it
      furiously and swung a length of it round him: and while the duchess panted
      and trembled at an outrage that won for her the sympathy of every lady
      present as well as the championship of the gentlemen, he tossed the lace
      to the floor and trampled on it, making his big voice intelligible over
      the uproar: ‘Hear what she does! ‘Tis a felony! She wears the stuff with
      Betty Worcester’s yellow starch on it for mock antique! And let who else
      wears it strip it off before the town shall say we are disgraced—when
      I tell you that Betty Worcester was hanged at Tyburn yesterday morning for
      murder!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      There were shrieks.
    </p>
<p>
      Hardly had he finished speaking before the assembly began to melt; he
      stood in the centre like a pole unwinding streamers, amid a confusion of
      hurrying dresses, the sound and whirl and drift whereof was as that of the
      autumnal strewn leaves on a wind rising in November. The troops of ladies
      were off to bereave themselves of their fashionable imitation old lace
      adornment, which denounced them in some sort abettors and associates of
      the sanguinary loathed wretch, Mrs. Elizabeth Worcester, their
      benefactress of the previous day, now hanged and dangling on the
      gallows-tree.
    </p>
<p>
      Those ladies who wore not imitation lace or any lace in the morning, were
      scarcely displeased with the beau for his exposure of them that did. The
      gentlemen were confounded by his exhibition of audacious power. The two
      gentlemen nighest upon violently resenting his brutality to Duchess Susan,
      led her from the room in company with Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The woman shall fear me to good purpose,’ Mr. Beamish said to himself.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
<p>
      Mr. Camwell was in the ante-room as Chloe passed out behind the two
      incensed supporters of Duchess Susan.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall be by the fir-trees on the Mount at eight this evening,’ she
      said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will be there,’ he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Drive Mr. Beamish into the country, that these gentlemen may have time to
      cool.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He promised her it should be done.
    </p>
<p>
      Close on the hour of her appointment, he stood under the fir-trees,
      admiring the sunset along the western line of hills, and when Chloe joined
      him he spoke of the beauty of the scene.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Though nothing seems more eloquently to say farewell,’ he added, with a
      sinking voice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We could say it now, and be friends,’ she answered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Later than now, you think it unlikely that you could forgive me, Chloe.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In truth, sir, you are making it hard for me.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have stayed here to keep watch; for no pleasure of my own,’ said he.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr. Beamish is an excellent protector of the duchess.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Excellent; and he is cleverly taught to suppose she fears him greatly;
      and when she offends him, he makes a display of his Jupiter’s awfulness,
      with the effect on woman of natural spirit which you have seen, and others
      had foreseen, that she is exasperated and grows reckless. Tie another knot
      in your string, Chloe.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She looked away, saying, ‘Were you not the cause? You were in collusion
      with that charlatan of the heath, who told them their fortunes this
      morning. I see far, both in the dark and in the light.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But not through a curtain. I was present.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hateful, hateful business of the spy! You have worked a great mischief
      Mr. Camwell. And how can you reconcile it to, your conscience that you
      should play so base a part?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have but performed my duty, dear madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You pretend that it is your devotion to me! I might be flattered if I saw
      not so abject a figure in my service. Now have I but four days of my month
      of happiness remaining, and my request to you is, leave me to enjoy them.
      I beseech you to go. Very humbly, most earnestly, I beg your departure.
      Grant it to me, and do not stay to poison my last days here. Leave us
      to-morrow. I will admit your good intentions. I give you my hand in
      gratitude. Adieu, Mr. Camwell.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He took her hand. ‘Adieu. I foresee an early separation, and this dear
      hand is mine while I have it in mine. Adieu. It is a word to be repeated
      at a parting like ours. We do not blow out our light with one breath: we
      let it fade gradually, like yonder sunset.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Speak so,’ said she.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah, Chloe, to give one’s life! And it is your happiness I have sought
      more than your favor.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I believe it; but I have not liked the means. You leave us to-morrow?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It seems to me that to-morrow is the term.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her face clouded. ‘That tells me a very uncertain promise.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You looked forth to a month of happiness—meaning a month of
      delusion. The delusion expires to-night. You will awaken to see your end
      of it in the morning. You have never looked beyond the month since the day
      of his arrival.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let him not be named, I supplicate you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you consent that another shall be sacrificed for you to enjoy your
      state of deception an hour longer?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am not deceived, sir. I wish for peace, and crave it, and that is all I
      would have.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you make her your peace-offering, whom you have engaged to serve! Too
      surely your eyes have been open as well as mine. Knot by knot—I have
      watched you—where is it?—you have marked the points in that
      silken string where the confirmation of a just suspicion was too strong
      for you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I did it, and still I continued merry?’ She subsided from her
      scornfulness on an involuntary ‘Ah!’ that was a shudder.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You acted Light Heart, madam, and too well to hoodwink me. Meanwhile you
      allowed that mischief to proceed, rather than have your crazy lullaby
      disturbed.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Indeed, Mr. Camwell, you presume.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The time, and my knowledge of what it is fraught with, demand it and
      excuse it. You and I, my dear and one only love on earth, stand outside of
      ordinary rules. We are between life and death.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We are so always.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Listen further to the preacher: We have them close on us, with the
      question, Which it shall be to-morrow. You are for sleeping on, but I say
      no; nor shall that iniquity of double treachery be committed because of
      your desire to be rocked in a cradle. Hear me out. The drug you have
      swallowed to cheat yourself will not bear the shock awaiting you tomorrow
      with the first light. Hear these birds! When next they sing, you will be
      broad awake, and of me, and the worship and service I would have dedicated
      to you, I do not... it is a spectral sunset of a day that was never to be!—awake,
      and looking on what? Back from a monstrous villainy to the forlorn wretch
      who winked at it with knots in a string. Count them then, and where will
      be your answer to heaven? I begged it of you, to save you from those blows
      of remorse; yes, terrible!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, no!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Terrible, I say!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are mistaken, Mr. Camwell. It is my soother. I tell my beads on it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘See how a persistent residence in this place has made a Pagan of the
      purest soul among us! Had you... but that day was not to lighten me! More
      adorable in your errors that you are than others by their virtues, you
      have sinned through excess of the qualities men prize. Oh, you have a
      boundless generosity, unhappily enwound with a pride as great. There is
      your fault, that is the cause of your misery. Too generous! too proud! You
      have trusted, and you will not cease to trust; you have vowed yourself to
      love, never to remonstrate, never to seem to doubt; it is too much your
      religion, rare verily. But bethink you of that inexperienced and most
      silly good creature who is on the rapids to her destruction. Is she not—you
      will cry it aloud to-morrow—your victim? You hear it within you
      now.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Friend, my dear, true friend,’ Chloe said in her deeper voice of melody,
      ‘set your mind at ease about to-morrow and her. Her safety is assured. I
      stake my life on it. She shall not be a victim. At the worst she will but
      have learnt a lesson. So, then, adieu! The West hangs like a garland of
      unwatered flowers, neglected by the mistress they adorned. Remember the
      scene, and that here we parted, and that Chloe wished you the happiness it
      was out of her power to bestow, because she was of another world, with her
      history written out to the last red streak before ever you knew her.
      Adieu; this time adieu for good!
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Camwell stood in her path. ‘Blind eyes, if you like,’ he said, ‘but
      you shall not hear blind language. I forfeit the poor consideration for me
      that I have treasured; hate me; better hated by you than shun my duty!
      Your duchess is away at the first dawn this next morning; it has come to
      that. I speak with full knowledge. Question her.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe threw a faltering scorn of him into her voice, as much as her
      heart’s sharp throbs would allow. ‘I question you, sir, how you came to
      this full knowledge you boast of?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have it; let that suffice. Nay, I will be particular; his coach is
      ordered for the time I name to you; her maid is already at a station on
      the road of the flight.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have their servants in your pay?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For the mine—the countermine. We must grub dirt to match deceivers.
      You, madam, have chosen to be delicate to excess, and have thrown it upon
      me to be gross, and if you please, abominable, in my means of defending
      you. It is not too late for you to save the lady, nor too late to bring
      him to the sense of honour.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I cannot think Colonel Poltermore so dishonourable.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poor Colonel Poltermore! The office he is made to fill is an old one. Are
      you not ashamed, Chloe?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have listened too long,’ she replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, if it is your pleasure, depart.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He made way for her. She passed him. Taking two hurried steps in the gloom
      of the twilight, she stopped, held at her heart, and painfully turning to
      him, threw her arms out, and let herself be seized and kissed.
    </p>
<p>
      On his asking pardon of her, which his long habit of respect forced him to
      do in the thick of rapture and repetitions, she said, ‘You rob no one.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh,’ he cried, ‘there is a reward, then, for faithful love. But am I the
      man I was a minute back? I have you; I embrace you; and I doubt that I am
      I. Or is it Chloe’s ghost?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has died and visits you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And will again?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe could not speak for languor.
    </p>
<p>
      The intensity of the happiness she gave by resting mutely where she was,
      charmed her senses. But so long had the frost been on them that their
      awakening to warmth was haunted by speculations on the sweet taste of this
      reward of faithfulness to him, and the strange taste of her own
      unfaithfulness to her. And reflecting on the cold act of speculation while
      strong arm and glowing mouth were pressing her, she thought her senses
      might really be dead, and she a ghost visiting the good youth for his
      comfort. So feel ghosts, she thought, and what we call happiness in love
      is a match between ecstasy and compliance. Another thought flew through
      her like a mortal shot: ‘Not so with those two! with them it will be
      ecstasy meeting ecstasy; they will take and give happiness in equal
      portions.’ A pang of jealousy traversed her frame. She made the shrewdness
      of it help to nerve her fervour in a last strain of him to her bosom, and
      gently releasing herself, she said, ‘No one is robbed. And now, dear
      friend, promise me that you will not disturb Mr. Beamish.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Chloe,’ said he, ‘have you bribed me?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not wish him to be troubled.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The duchess, I have told you—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I know. But you have Chloe’s word that she will watch over the duchess
      and die to save her. It is an oath. You have heard of some arrangements. I
      say they shall lead to nothing: it shall not take place. Indeed, my
      friend, I am awake; I see as much as you see. And those... after being
      where I have been, can you suppose I have a regret? But she is my dear and
      peculiar charge, and if she runs a risk, trust to me that there shall be
      no catastrophe; I swear it; so, now, adieu. We sup in company to-night.
      They will be expecting some of Chloe’s verses, and she must sing to
      herself for a few minutes to stir the bed her songs take wing from;
      therefore, we will part, and for her sake avoid her; do not be present at
      our table, or in the room, or anywhere there. Yes, you rob no one,’ she
      said, in a voice that curled through him deliciously by wavering; but I
      think I may blush at recollections, and I would rather have you absent.
      Adieu! I will not ask for obedience from you beyond to-night. Your word?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He gave it in a stupor of felicity, and she fled.

<h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
<p>
      Chloe drew the silken string from her bosom, as she descended the dim
      pathway through the furies, and set her fingers travelling along it for
      the number of the knots. ‘I have no right to be living,’ she said. Seven
      was the number; seven years she had awaited her lover’s return; she
      counted her age and completed it in sevens. Fatalism had sustained her
      during her lover’s absence; it had fast hold of her now. Thereby had she
      been enabled to say, ‘He will come’; and saying, ‘He has come,’ her touch
      rested on the first knot in the string. She had no power to displace her
      fingers, and the cause of the tying of the knot stood across her brain
      marked in dull red characters, legible neither to her eye nor to her
      understanding, but a reviving of the hour that brought it on her spirit
      with human distinctness, except of the light of day: she had a sense of
      having forfeited light, and seeing perhaps more clearly. Everything
      assured her that she saw more clearly than others; she saw too when it was
      good to cease to live.
    </p>
<p>
      Hers was the unhappy lot of one gifted with poet-imagination to throb with
      the woman supplanting her and share the fascination of the man who
      deceived. At their first meeting, in her presence, she had seen that they
      were not strangers; she pitied them for speaking falsely, and when she
      vowed to thwart this course of evil it to save a younger creature of her
      sex, not in rivalry. She treated them both with a proud generosity
      surpassing gentleness. All that there was of selfishness in her bosom
      resolved to the enjoyment of her one month of strongly willed delusion.
    </p>
<p>
      The kiss she had sunk to robbed no one, not even her body’s purity, for
      when this knot was tied she consigned herself to her end, and had become a
      bag of dust. The other knots in the string pointed to verifications; this
      first one was a suspicion, and it was the more precious, she felt it to be
      more a certainty; it had come from the dark world beyond us, where all is
      known. Her belief that it had come thence was nourished by testimony, the
      space of blackness wherein she had lived since, exhausting her last
      vitality in a simulation of infantile happiness, which was nothing other
      than the carrying on of her emotion of the moment of sharp sour sweet—such
      as it may be, the doomed below attain for their knowledge of joy—when,
      at the first meeting with her lover, the perception of his treachery to
      the soul confiding in him, told her she had lived, and opened out the
      cherishable kingdom of insensibility to her for her heritage.
    </p>
<p>
      She made her tragic humility speak thankfully to the wound that slew her.
      ‘Had it not been so, I should not have seen him,’ she said:—Her
      lover would not have come to her but for his pursuit of another woman.
    </p>
<p>
      She pardoned him for being attracted by that beautiful transplant of the
      fields: pardoned her likewise. ‘He when I saw him first was as beautiful
      to me. For him I might have done as much.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Far away in a lighted hall of the West, her family raised hands of
      reproach. They were minute objects, keenly discerned as diminished figures
      cut in steel. Feeling could not be very warm for them, they were so small,
      and a sea that had drowned her ran between; and looking that way she had
      scarce any warmth of feeling save for a white rhaiadr leaping out of
      broken cloud through branched rocks, where she had climbed and dreamed
      when a child. The dream was then of the coloured days to come; now she was
      more infant in her mind, and she watched the scattered water broaden, and
      tasted the spray, sat there drinking the scene, untroubled by hopes as a
      lamb, different only from an infant in knowing that she had thrown off
      life to travel back to her home and be refreshed. She heard her people
      talk; they were unending babblers in the waterfall. Truth was with them,
      and wisdom. How, then, could she pretend to any right to live? Already she
      had no name; she was less living than a tombstone. For who was Chloe? Her
      family might pass the grave of Chloe without weeping, without moralizing.
      They had foreseen her ruin, they had foretold it, they noised it in the
      waters, and on they sped to the plains, telling the world of their
      prophecy, and making what was untold as yet a lighter thing to do.
    </p>
<p>
      The lamps in an irregularly dotted line underneath the hill beckoned her
      to her task of appearing as the gayest of them that draw their breath for
      the day and have pulses for the morrow.

<h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
<p>
      At midnight the great supper party to celebrate the reconciliation of Mr.
      Beamish and Duchess Susan broke up, and beneath a soft fair sky the
      ladies, with their silvery chatter of gratitude for amusement, caught
      Chloe in their arms to kiss her, rendering it natural for their cavaliers
      to exclaim that Chloe was blest above mortals. The duchess preferred to
      walk. Her spirits were excited, and her language smelt of her origin, but
      the superb fleshly beauty of the woman was aglow, and crying, ‘I declare I
      should burst in one of those boxes—just as if you’d stalled me!’ she
      fanned a wind on her face, and sumptuously spread her spherical skirts,
      attended by the vanquished and captive Colonel Poltermore, a gentleman
      manifestly bent on insinuating sly slips of speech to serve for here a
      pinch of powder, there a match. ‘Am I?’ she was heard to say. She blew
      prodigious deep-chested sighs of a coquette that has taken to roaring.
    </p>
<p>
      Presently her voice tossed out: ‘As if I would!’ These vivid illuminations
      of the Colonel’s proceedings were a pasture to the rearward groups,
      composed of two very grand ladies, Caseldy, Mr. Beamish, a lord, and
      Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You man! Oh!’ sprang from the duchess. ‘What do I hear? I won’t listen; I
      can’t, I mustn’t, I oughtn’t.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      So she said, but her head careened, she gave him her coy reluctant ear,
      with total abandonment to the seductions of his whispers, and the lord let
      fly a peal of laughter. It had been a supper of copious wine, and the
      songs which rise from wine. Nature was excused by our midnight
      naturalists.
    </p>
<p>
      The two great dames, admonished by the violence of the nobleman’s
      laughter, laid claim on Mr. Beamish to accompany them at their parting
      with Chloe and Duchess Susan.
    </p>
<p>
      In the momentary shuffling of couples incident to adieux among a company,
      the duchess murmured to Caseldy:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have I done it well.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He praised her for perfection in her acting. ‘I am at your door at three,
      remember.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My heart’s in my mouth,’ said she.
    </p>
<p>
      Colonel Poltermore still had the privilege of conducting her the few
      farther steps to her lodgings.
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy walked beside Chloe, and silently, until he said, ‘If I have not
      yet mentioned the subject—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If it is an allusion to money let me not hear it to-night,’ she replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can only say that my lawyers have instructions. But my lawyers cannot
      pay you in gratitude. Do not think me in your hardest review of my
      misconduct ungrateful. I have ever esteemed you above all women; I do, and
      I shall; you are too much above me. I am afraid I am a composition of bad
      stuff; I did not win a very particularly good name on the Continent; I
      begin to know myself, and in comparison with you, dear Catherine——’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You speak to Chloe,’ she said. ‘Catherine is a buried person. She died
      without pain. She is by this time dust.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The man heaved his breast. ‘Women have not an idea of our temptations.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are excused by me for all your errors, Caseldy. Always remember
      that.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He sighed profoundly. ‘Ay, you have a Christian’s heart.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She answered, ‘I have come to the conclusion that it is a Pagan’s.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As for me,’ he rejoined, ‘I am a fatalist. Through life I have seen my
      destiny. What is to be, will be; we can do nothing.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have heard of one who expired of a surfeit that he anticipated, nay
      proclaimed, when indulging in the last desired morsel,’ said Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He was driven to it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘From within.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy acquiesced; his wits were clouded, and an illustration even
      coarser and more grotesque would have won a serious nod and a sigh from
      him. ‘Yes, we are moved by other hands!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is pleasant to think so: and think it of me tomorrow. Will you!’ said
      Chloe.
    </p>
<p>
      He promised it heartily, to induce her to think the same of him.
    </p>
<p>
      Their separation was in no way remarkable. The pretty formalities were
      executed at the door, and the pair of gentlemen departed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s quite dark still,’ Duchess Susan said, looking up at the sky, and
      she ran upstairs, and sank, complaining of the weakness of her legs, in a
      chair of the ante-chamber of her bedroom, where Chloe slept. Then she
      asked the time of the night. She could not suppress her hushed ‘Oh!’ of
      heavy throbbing from minute to minute. Suddenly she started off at a quick
      stride to her own room, saying that it must be sleepiness which affected
      her so.
    </p>
<p>
      Her bedroom had a door to the sitting-room, and thence, as also from
      Chloe’s room, the landing on the stairs was reached, for the room ran
      parallel with both bed-chambers. She walked in it and threw the window
      open, but closed it immediately; opened and shut the door, and returned
      and called for Chloe. She wanted to be read to. Chloe named certain
      composing books. The duchess chose a book of sermons. ‘But we’re all such
      dreadful sinners, it’s better not to bother ourselves late at night.’ She
      dismissed that suggestion. Chloe proposed books of poetry. ‘Only I don’t
      understand them except about larks, and buttercups, and hayfields, and
      that’s no comfort to a woman burning,’ was the answer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you feverish, madam?’ said Chloe. And the duchess was sharp on her:
      ‘Yes, madam, I am.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She reproved herself in a change of tone: ‘No, Chloe, not feverish, only
      this air of yours here is such an exciting air, as the doctor says; and
      they made me drink wine, and I played before supper—Oh! my money; I
      used to say I could get more, but now!’ she sighed—‘but there’s
      better in the world than money. You know that, don’t you, you dear? Tell
      me. And I want you to be happy; that you’ll find. I do wish we could all
      be!’ She wept, and spoke of requiring a little music to compose her.
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe stretched a hand for her guitar. Duchess Susan listened to some
      notes, and cried that it went to her heart and hurt her. ‘Everything we
      like a lot has a fence and a board against trespassers, because of such a
      lot of people in the world,’ she moaned. ‘Don’t play, put down that thing,
      please, dear. You’re the cleverest creature anybody has ever met; they all
      say so. I wish I——Lovely women catch men, and clever women
      keep them: I’ve heard that said in this wretched place, and it ‘s a nice
      prospect for me, next door to a fool! I know I am.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The duke adores you, madam.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poor duke! Do let him be—sleeping so woebegone with his mouth so,
      and that chin of a baby, like as if he dreamed of a penny whistle. He
      shouldn’t have let me come here. Talk of Mr. Beamish. How he will miss
      you, Chloe!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He will,’ Chloe said sadly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you go, dear.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am going.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why should you leave him, Chloe?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And there, the thought of it makes you miserable!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It does.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You needn’t, I’m sure.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe looked at her.
    </p>
<p>
      The duchess turned her head. ‘Why can’t you be gay, as you were at the
      supper-table, Chloe? You’re out to him like a flower when the sun jumps
      over the hill; you’re up like a lark in the dews; as I used to be when I
      thought of nothing. Oh, the early morning; and I’m sleepy. What a beast I
      feel, with my grandeur, and the time in an hour or two for the birds to
      sing, and me ready to drop. I must go and undress.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She rushed on Chloe, kissed her hastily, declaring that she was quite dead
      of fatigue, and dismissed her. ‘I don’t want help, I can undress myself.
      As if Susan Barley couldn’t do that for herself! and you may shut your
      door, I sha’n’t have any frights to-night, I’m so tired out.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Another kiss,’ Chloe said tenderly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, take it’—the duchess leaned her cheek—‘but I’m so tired
      I don’t know what I’m doing.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It will not be on your conscience,’ Chloe answered, kissing her warmly.
    </p>
<p>
      Will those words she withdrew, and the duchess closed the door. She ran a
      bolt in it immediately.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m too tired to know anything I’m doing,’ she said to herself, and stood
      with shut eyes to hug certain thoughts which set her bosom heaving.
    </p>
<p>
      There was the bed, there was the clock. She had the option of lying down
      and floating quietly into the day, all peril past. It seemed sweet for a
      minute. But it soon seemed an old, a worn, an end-of-autumn life, chill,
      without aim, like a something that was hungry and toothless. The bed
      proposing innocent sleep repelled her and drove her to the clock. The
      clock was awful: the hand at the hour, the finger following the minute,
      commanded her to stir actively, and drove her to gentle meditations on the
      bed. She lay down dressed, after setting her light beside the clock, that
      she might see it at will, and considering it necessary for the bed to
      appear to have been lain on. Considering also that she ought to be heard
      moving about in the process of undressing, she rose from the bed to make
      sure of her reading of the guilty clock. An hour and twenty minutes! she
      had no more time than that: and it was not enough for her various
      preparations, though it was true that her maid had packed and taken a box
      of the things chiefly needful; but the duchess had to change her shoes and
      her dress, and run at bo-peep with the changes of her mind, a sedative
      preface to any fatal step among women of her complexion, for so they
      invite indecision to exhaust their scruples, and they let the blood have
      its way. Having so short a space of time, she thought the matter decided,
      and with some relief she flung despairing on the bed, and lay down for
      good with her duke. In a little while her head was at work reviewing him
      sternly, estimating him not less accurately than the male moralist
      charitable to her sex would do. She quitted the bed, with a spring to
      escape her imagined lord; and as if she had felt him to be there, she lay
      down no more. A quiet life like that was flatter to her idea than a
      handsomely bound big book without any print on the pages, and without a
      picture. Her contemplation of it, contrasted with the life waved to her
      view by the timepiece, set her whole system rageing; she burned to fly.
      Providently, nevertheless, she thumped a pillow, and threw the bedclothes
      into proper disorder, to inform the world that her limbs had warmed them,
      and that all had been impulse with her. She then proceeded to disrobe,
      murmuring to herself that she could stop now, and could stop now, at each
      stage of the advance to a fresh dressing of her person, and moralizing on
      her singular fate, in the mouth of an observer. ‘She was shot up suddenly
      over everybody’s head, and suddenly down she went.’ Susan whispered to
      herself: ‘But it was for love!’ Possessed by the rosiness of love, she
      finished her business, with an attention to everything needed that was
      equal to perfect serenity of mind. After which there was nothing to do,
      save to sit humped in a chair, cover her face and count the
      clock-tickings, that said, Yes—no; do—don’t; fly—stay;
      fly—fly! It seemed to her she heard a moving. Well she might with
      that dreadful heart of hers!
    </p>
<p>
      Chloe was asleep, at peace by this time, she thought; and how she envied
      Chloe! She might be as happy, if she pleased. Why not? But what kind of
      happiness was it? She likened it to that of the corpse underground, and
      shrank distastefully.
    </p>
<p>
      Susan stood at her glass to have a look at the creature about whom there
      was all this disturbance, and she threw up her arms high for a languid,
      not unlovely yawn, that closed in blissful shuddering with the sensation
      of her lover’s arms having wormed round her waist and taken her while she
      was defenceless. For surely they would. She took a jewelled ring, his
      gift, from her purse, and kissed it, and drew it on and off her finger,
      leaving it on. Now she might wear it without fear of inquiries and
      virtuous eyebrows. O heavenly now—if only it were an hour hence; and
      going behind galloping horses!
    </p>
<p>
      The clock was at the terrible moment. She hesitated internally and
      hastened; once her feet stuck fast, and firmly she said, ‘No’; but the
      clock was her lord. The clock was her lover and her lord; and obeying it,
      she managed to get into the sitting-room, on the pretext that she merely
      wished to see through the front window whether daylight was coming.
    </p>
<p>
      How well she knew that half-light of the ebb of the wave of darkness.
    </p>
<p>
      Strange enough it was to see it showing houses regaining their solidity of
      the foregone day, instead of still fields, black hedges, familiar shapes
      of trees. The houses had no wakefulness, they were but seen to stand, and
      the light was a revelation of emptiness. Susan’s heart was cunning to
      reproach her duke for the difference of the scene she beheld from that of
      the innocent open-breasted land. Yes, it was dawn in a wicked place that
      she never should have been allowed to visit. But where was he whom she
      looked for? There! The cloaked figure of a man was at the corner of the
      street. It was he. Her heart froze; but her limbs were strung to throw off
      the house, and reach air, breathe, and (as her thoughts ran) swoon,
      well-protected. To her senses the house was a house on fire, and crying to
      her to escape.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet she stepped deliberately, to be sure-footed in a dusky room; she
      touched along the wall and came to the door, where a foot-stool nearly
      tripped her. Here her touch was at fault, for though she knew she must be
      close by the door, she was met by an obstruction unlike wood, and the door
      seemed neither shut nor open. She could not find the handle; something
      hung over it. Thinking coolly, she fancied the thing must be a gown or
      dressing-gown; it hung heavily. Her fingers were sensible of the touch of
      silk; she distinguished a depending bulk, and she felt at it very
      carefully and mechanically, saying within herself, in her anxiety to pass
      it without noise, ‘If I should awake poor Chloe, of all people!’ Her alarm
      was that the door might creak. Before any other alarm had struck her
      brain, the hand she felt with was in a palsy, her mouth gaped, her throat
      thickened, the dust-ball rose in her throat, and the effort to swallow it
      down and get breath kept her from acute speculation while she felt again,
      pinched, plucked at the thing, ready to laugh, ready to shriek. Above her
      head, all on one side, the thing had a round white top. Could it be a hand
      that her touch had slid across? An arm too! this was an arm! She clutched
      it, imagining that it clung to her. She pulled it to release herself from
      it, desperately she pulled, and a lump descended, and a flash of all the
      torn nerves of her body told her that a dead human body was upon her.
    </p>
<p>
      At a quarter to four o’clock of a midsummer morning, as Mr. Beamish
      relates of his last share in the Tale of Chloe, a woman’s voice, in
      piercing notes of anguish, rang out three shrieks consecutively, which
      were heard by him at the instant of his quitting his front doorstep, in
      obedience to the summons of young Mr. Camwell, delivered ten minutes
      previously, with great urgency, by that gentleman’s lacquey. On his
      reaching the street of the house inhabited by Duchess Susan, he perceived
      many night-capped heads at windows, and one window of the house in
      question lifted but vacant. His first impression accused the pair of
      gentlemen, whom he saw bearing drawn swords in no friendly attitude of an
      ugly brawl that had probably affrighted her Grace, or her personal
      attendant, a woman capable of screaming, for he was well assured that it
      could not have been Chloe, the least likely of her sex to abandon herself
      to the use of their weapons either in terror or in jeopardy. The
      antagonists were Mr. Camwell and Count Caseldy. On his approaching them,
      Mr. Camwell sheathed his sword, saying that his work was done. Caseldy was
      convulsed with wrath, to such a degree as to make the part of an
      intermediary perilous. There had been passes between them, and Caseldy
      cried aloud that he would have his enemy’s blood. The night-watch was
      nowhere. Soon, however, certain shopmen and their apprentices assisted Mr.
      Beamish to preserve the peace, despite the fury of Caseldy and the
      provocations—‘not easy to withstand,’ says the chronicler—offered
      by him to young Camwell. The latter said to Mr. Beamish: ‘I knew I should
      be no match, so I sent for you,’ causing his friend astonishment, inasmuch
      as he was assured of the youth’s natural valour.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish was about to deliver an allocution of reproof to them in equal
      shares, being entirely unsuspicious of any other reason for the alarum
      than this palpable outbreak of a rivalry that he would have inclined to
      attribute to the charms of Chloe, when the house-door swung wide for them
      to enter, and the landlady of the house, holding clasped hands at full
      stretch, implored them to run up to the poor lady: ‘Oh, she’s dead; she’s
      dead, dead!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Caseldy rushed past her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How, dead! good woman?’ Mr. Beamish questioned her most incredulously,
      half-smiling.
    </p>
<p>
      She answered among her moans: ‘Dead by the neck; off the door—Oh!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Young Camwell pressed his forehead, with a call on his Maker’s name. As
      they reached the landing upstairs, Caseldy came out of the sitting-room.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Which?’ said Camwell to the speaking of his face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She!’ said the other.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The duchess?’ Mr. Beamish exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
      But Camwell walked into the room. He had nothing to ask after that reply.
    </p>
<p>
      The figure stretched along the floor was covered with a sheet. The young
      man fell at his length beside it, and his face was downward.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish relates: ‘To this day, when I write at an interval of fifteen
      years, I have the tragic ague of that hour in my blood, and I behold the
      shrouded form of the most admirable of women, whose heart was broken by a
      faithless man ere she devoted her wreck of life to arrest one weaker than
      herself on the descent to perdition. Therein it was beneficently granted
      her to be of the service she prayed to be through her death. She died to
      save. In a last letter, found upon her pincushion, addressed to me under
      seal of secrecy toward the parties principally concerned, she anticipates
      the whole confession of the unhappy duchess. Nay, she prophesies: “The
      duchess will tell you truly she has had enough of love!” Those actual
      words were reiterated to me by the poor lady daily until her lord arrived
      to head the funeral procession, and assist in nursing back the shattered
      health of his wife to a state that should fit her for travelling. To me,
      at least, she was constant in repeating, “No more of love!” By her
      behaviour to her duke, I can judge her to have been sincere. She spoke of
      feeling Chloe’s eyes go through her with every word of hers that she
      recollected. Nor was the end of Chloe less effective upon the traitor. He
      was in the procession to her grave. He spoke to none. There is a line of
      the verse bearing the superscription, “My Reasons for Dying,” that shows
      her to have been apprehensive to secure the safety of Mr. Camwell:
    </p>
<pre>
          I die because my heart is dead
          To warn a soul from sin I die:
          I die that blood may not be shed, etc.
</pre>
<p>
      She feared he would be somewhere on the road to mar the fugitives, and she
      knew him, as indeed he knew himself, no match for one trained in the
      foreign tricks of steel, ready though he was to dispute the traitor’s way.
      She remembers Mr. Camwell’s petition for the knotted silken string in her
      request that it shall be cut from her throat and given to him.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Beamish indulges in verses above the grave of Chloe. They are of a
      character to cool emotion. But when we find a man, who is commonly of the
      quickest susceptibility to ridicule as well as to what is befitting,
      careless of exposure, we may reflect on the truthfulness of feeling by
      which he is drawn to pass his own guard and come forth in his nakedness;
      something of the poet’s tongue may breathe to us through his mortal
      stammering, even if we have to acknowledge that a quotation would scatter
      pathos.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
<p>
      The experience of great officials who have laid down their dignities
      before death, or have had the philosophic mind to review themselves while
      still wielding the deputy sceptre, teaches them that in the exercise of
      authority over men an eccentric behaviour in trifles has most exposed them
      to hostile criticism and gone farthest to jeopardize their popularity. It
      is their Achilles’ heel; the place where their mother Nature holds them as
      she dips them in our waters. The eccentricity of common persons is the
      entertainment of the multitude, and the maternal hand is perceived for a
      cherishing and endearing sign upon them; but rarely can this be found
      suitable for the august in station; only, indeed, when their sceptre is no
      more fearful than a grandmother’s birch; and these must learn from it
      sooner or later that they are uncomfortably mortal.
    </p>
<p>
      When herrings are at auction on a beach, for example, the man of chief
      distinction in the town should not step in among a poor fraternity to take
      advantage of an occasion of cheapness, though it be done, as he may
      protest, to relieve the fishermen of a burden; nor should such a dignitary
      as the bailiff of a Cinque Port carry home the spoil of victorious
      bargaining on his arm in a basket. It is not that his conduct is in itself
      objectionable, so much as that it causes him to be popularly weighed; and
      during life, until the best of all advocates can plead before our fellow
      Englishmen that we are out of their way, it is prudent to avoid the
      process.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Tinman, however, this high-stepping person in question, happened to
      have come of a marketing mother. She had started him from a small shop to
      a big one. He, by the practice of her virtues, had been enabled to start
      himself as a gentleman. He was a man of this ambition, and prouder behind
      it. But having started himself precipitately, he took rank among
      independent incomes, as they are called, only to take fright at the perils
      of starvation besetting one who has been tempted to abandon the source of
      fifty per cent. So, if noble imagery were allowable in our time in prose,
      might alarms and partial regrets be assumed to animate the splendid
      pumpkin cut loose from the suckers. Deprived of that prodigious
      nourishment of the shop in the fashionable seaport of Helmstone, he
      retired upon his native town, the Cinque Port of Crikswich, where he
      rented the cheapest residence he could discover for his habitation, the
      House on the Beach, and lived imposingly, though not in total disaccord
      with his old mother’s principles. His income, as he observed to his
      widowed sister and solitary companion almost daily in their privacy, was
      respectable. The descent from an altitude of fifty to five per cent.
      cannot but be felt. Nevertheless it was a comforting midnight bolster
      reflection for a man, turning over to the other side between a dream and a
      wink, that he was making no bad debts, and one must pay to be addressed as
      esquire. Once an esquire, you are off the ground in England and on the
      ladder. An esquire can offer his hand in marriage to a lady in her own
      right; plain esquires have married duchesses; they marry baronets’ 
      daughters every day of the week.
    </p>
<p>
      Thoughts of this kind were as the rise and fall of waves in the bosom of
      the new esquire. How often in his Helmstone shop had he not heard titled
      ladies disdaining to talk a whit more prettily than ordinary women; and he
      had been a match for the subtlety of their pride—he understood it.
      He knew well that at the hint of a proposal from him they would have
      spoken out in a manner very different to that of ordinary women. The
      lightning, only to be warded by an esquire, was in them. He quitted
      business at the age of forty, that he might pretend to espousals with a
      born lady; or at least it was one of the ideas in his mind.
    </p>
<p>
      And here, I think, is the moment for the epitaph of anticipation over him,
      and the exclamation, alas! I would not be premature, but it is necessary
      to create some interest in him, and no one but a foreigner could feel it
      at present for the Englishman who is bursting merely to do like the rest
      of his countrymen, and rise above them to shake them class by class as the
      dust from his heels. Alas! then an—undertaker’s pathos is better
      than none at all—he was not a single-minded aspirant to our social
      honours. The old marketing mother; to whom he owed his fortunes, was in
      his blood to confound his ambition; and so contradictory was the man’s
      nature, that in revenge for disappointments, there were times when he
      turned against the saving spirit of parsimony. Readers deep in Greek
      dramatic writings will see the fatal Sisters behind the chair of a man who
      gives frequent and bigger dinners, that he may become important in his
      neighbourhood, while decreasing the price he pays for his wine, that he
      may miserably indemnify himself for the outlay. A sip of his wine fetched
      the breath, as when men are in the presence of the tremendous elements of
      nature. It sounded the constitution more darkly-awful, and with a
      profounder testimony to stubborn health, than the physician’s instruments.
      Most of the guests at Mr. Tinman’s table were so constructed that they
      admired him for its powerful quality the more at his announcement of the
      price of it; the combined strength and cheapness probably flattering them,
      as by another mystic instance of the national energy. It must have been
      so, since his townsmen rejoiced to hail him as head of their town. Here
      and there a solitary esquire, fished out of the bathing season to dine at
      the house on the beach, was guilty of raising one of those clamours
      concerning subsequent headaches, which spread an evil reputation as a
      pall. A resident esquire or two, in whom a reminiscence of Tinman’s table
      may be likened to the hook which some old trout has borne away from the
      angler as the most vivid of warnings to him to beware for the future,
      caught up the black report and propagated it.
    </p>
<p>
      The Lieutenant of the Coastguard, hearing the latest conscious victim, or
      hearing of him, would nod his head and say he had never dined at Tinman’s
      table without a headache ensuing and a visit to the chemist’s shop; which,
      he was assured, was good for trade, and he acquiesced, as it was right to
      do in a man devoted to his country. He dined with Tinman again. We try our
      best to be social. For eight months in our year he had little choice but
      to dine with Tinman or be a hermit attached to a telescope.
    </p>
<p>
      “Where are you going, Lieutenant?” His frank reply to the question was, “I
      am going to be killed;” and it grew notorious that this meant Tinman’s
      table. We get on together as well as we can. Perhaps if we were an acutely
      calculating people we should find it preferable both for trade and our
      physical prosperity to turn and kill Tinman, in contempt of consequences.
      But we are not, and so he does the business gradually for us. A generous
      people we must be, for Tinman was not detested. The recollection of “next
      morning” caused him to be dimly feared.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman, meanwhile, was awake only to the Circumstance that he made no
      progress as an esquire, except on the envelopes of letters, and in his own
      esteem. That broad region he began to occupy to the exclusion of other
      inhabitants; and the result of such a state of princely isolation was a
      plunge of his whole being into deep thoughts. From the hour of his
      investiture as the town’s chief man, thoughts which were long shots took
      possession of him. He had his wits about him; he was alive to ridicule; he
      knew he was not popular below, or on easy terms with people above him, and
      he meditated a surpassing stroke as one of the Band of Esq., that had
      nothing original about it to perplex and annoy the native mind, yet was
      dazzling. Few members of the privileged Band dare even imagine the thing.
    </p>
<p>
      It will hardly be believed, but it is historical fact, that in the act of
      carrying fresh herrings home on his arm, he entertained the idea of a
      visit to the First Person and Head of the realm, and was indulging in
      pleasing visions of the charms of a personal acquaintance. Nay, he had
      already consulted with brother jurats. For you must know that one of the
      princesses had recently suffered betrothal in the newspapers, and
      supposing her to deign to ratify the engagement, what so reasonable on the
      part of a Cinque Port chieftain as to congratulate his liege mistress, her
      illustrious mother? These are thoughts and these are deeds &gt;which give
      emotional warmth and colour to the ejecter members of a population
      wretchedly befogged. They are our sunlight, and our brighter theme of
      conversation. They are necessary to the climate and the Saxon mind; and it
      would be foolish to put them away, as it is foolish not to do our utmost
      to be intimate with terrestrial splendours while we have them—as it
      may be said of wardens, mayors, and bailiffs-at command. Tinman was quite
      of this opinion. They are there to relieve our dulness. We have them in
      the place of heavenly; and he would have argued that we have a right to
      bother them too. He had a notion, up in the clouds, of a Sailors’ 
      Convalescent Hospital at Crikswich to seduce a prince with, hand him the
      trowel, make him “lay the stone,” and then poor prince! refresh him at
      table. But that was a matter for by and by.
    </p>
<p>
      His purchase of herrings completed, Mr. Tinman walked across the mound of
      shingle to the house on the beach. He was rather a fresh-faced man, of the
      Saxon colouring, and at a distance looking good-humoured. That he should
      have been able to make such an appearance while doing daily battle with
      his wine, was a proof of great physical vigour. His pace was leisurely, as
      it must needs be over pebbles, where half a step is subtracted from each
      whole one in passing; and, besides, he was aware of a general breath at
      his departure that betokened a censorious assembly. Why should he not
      market for himself? He threw dignity into his retreating figure in
      response to the internal interrogation. The moment &gt;was one when conscious
      rectitude =pliers man should have a tail for its just display.
      Philosophers have drawn attention to the power of the human face to
      express pure virtue, but no sooner has it passed on than the spirit erect
      within would seem helpless. The breadth of our shoulders is apparently
      presented for our critics to write on. Poor duty is done by the simple
      sense of moral worth, to supplant that absence of feature in the plain
      flat back. We are below the animals in this. How charged with language
      behind him is a dog! Everybody has noticed it. Let a dog turn away from a
      hostile circle, and his crisp and wary tail not merely defends him, it
      menaces; it is a weapon. Man has no choice but to surge and boil, or
      stiffen preposterously. Knowing the popular sentiment about his marketing—for
      men can see behind their backs, though they may have nothing to speak with—Tinman
      resembled those persons of principle who decline to pay for a “Bless your
      honour!” from a voluble beggar-woman, and obtain the reverse of it after
      they have gone by. He was sufficiently sensitive to feel that his back was
      chalked as on a slate. The only remark following him was, “There he goes!”
     </p>
<p>
      He went to the seaward gate of the house on the beach, made practicable in
      a low flint wall, where he was met by his sister Martha, to whom he handed
      the basket. Apparently he named the cost of his purchase per dozen. She
      touched the fish and pressed the bellies of the topmost, it might be to
      question them tenderly concerning their roes. Then the couple passed out
      of sight. Herrings were soon after this despatching their odours through
      the chimneys of all Crikswich, and there was that much of concord and
      festive union among the inhabitants.
    </p>
<p>
      The house on the beach had been posted where it stood, one supposes, for
      the sake of the sea-view, from which it turned right about to face the
      town across a patch of grass and salt scurf, looking like a square and
      scornful corporal engaged in the perpetual review of an awkward squad of
      recruits. Sea delighted it not, nor land either. Marine Parade fronting it
      to the left, shaded sickly eyes, under a worn green verandah, from a sun
      that rarely appeared, as the traducers of spinsters pretend those virgins
      are ever keenly on their guard against him that cometh not. Belle Vue
      Terrace stared out of lank glass panes without reserve, unashamed of its
      yellow complexion. A gaping public-house, calling itself newly Hotel, fell
      backward a step. Villas with the titles of royalty and bloody battles
      claimed five feet of garden, and swelled in bowwindows beside other villas
      which drew up firmly, commending to the attention a decent straightness
      and unintrusive decorum in preference. On an elevated meadow to the right
      was the Crouch. The Hall of Elba nestled among weather-beaten dwarf woods
      further toward the cliff. Shavenness, featurelessness, emptiness,
      clamminess scurfiness, formed the outward expression of a town to which
      people were reasonably glad to come from London in summer-time, for there
      was nothing in Crikswich to distract the naked pursuit of health. The sea
      tossed its renovating brine to the determinedly sniffing animal, who went
      to his meals with an appetite that rendered him cordially eulogistic of
      the place, in spite of certain frank whiffs of sewerage coming off an open
      deposit on the common to mingle with the brine. Tradition told of a French
      lady and gentleman entering the town to take lodgings for a month, and
      that on the morrow they took a boat from the shore, saying in their faint
      English to a sailor veteran of the coastguard, whom they had consulted
      about the weather, “It is better zis zan zat,” as they shrugged between
      rough sea and corpselike land. And they were not seen again. Their meaning
      none knew. Having paid their bill at the lodging-house, their conduct was
      ascribed to systematic madness. English people came to Crikswich for the
      pure salt sea air, and they did not expect it to be cooked and dressed and
      decorated for them. If these things are done to nature, it is nature no
      longer that you have, but something Frenchified. Those French are for
      trimming Neptune’s beard! Only wait, and you are sure to find variety in
      nature, more than you may like. You will find it in Neptune. What say you
      to a breach of the sea-wall, and an inundation of the aromatic grass-flat
      extending from the house on the beach to the tottering terraces, villas,
      cottages: and public-house transformed by its ensign to Hotel, along the
      frontage of the town? Such an event had occurred of old, and had given the
      house on the beach the serious shaking great Neptune in his wrath alone
      can give. But many years had intervened. Groynes had been run down to
      intercept him and divert him. He generally did his winter mischief on a
      mill and salt marshes lower westward. Mr. Tinman had always been extremely
      zealous in promoting the expenditure of what moneys the town had to spare
      upon the protection of the shore, as it were for the propitiation or
      defiance of the sea-god. There was a kindly joke against him an that
      subject among brother jurats. He retorted with the joke, that the first
      thing for Englishmen to look to were England’s defences.
    </p>
<p>
      But it will not do to be dwelling too fondly on our eras of peace, for
      which we make such splendid sacrifices. Peace, saving for the advent of a
      German band, which troubled the repose of the town at intervals, had
      imparted to the inhabitants of Crikswich, within and without, the likeness
      to its most perfect image, together, it must be confessed, with a degree
      of nervousness that invested common events with some of the terrors of the
      Last Trump, when one night, just upon the passing of the vernal equinox,
      something happened.

<h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<p>
      A carriage Stopped short in the ray of candlelight that was fitfully and
      feebly capering on the windy blackness outside the open workshop of
      Crickledon, the carpenter, fronting the sea-beach. Mr. Tinnnan’s house was
      inquired for. Crickledon left off planing; at half-sprawl over the board,
      he bawled out, “Turn to the right; right ahead; can’t mistake it.” He
      nodded to one of the cronies intent on watching his labours: “Not unless
      they mean to be bait for whiting-pout. Who’s that for Tinman, I wonder?”
       The speculations of Crickledon’s friends were lost in the scream of the
      plane.
    </p>
<p>
      One cast an eye through the door and observed that the carriage was there
      still. “Gentleman’s got out and walked,” said Crickledon. He was informed
      that somebody was visible inside. “Gentleman’s wife, mayhap,” he said. His
      friends indulged in their privilege of thinking what they liked, and there
      was the usual silence of tongues in the shop. He furnished them sound and
      motion for their amusement, and now and then a scrap of conversation; and
      the sedater spirits dwelling in his immediate neighbourhood were
      accustomed to step in and see him work up to supper-time, instead of
      resorting to the more turbid and costly excitement of the public-house.
    </p>
<p>
      Crickledon looked up from the measurement of a thumb-line. In the doorway
      stood a bearded gentleman, who announced himself with the startling
      exclamation, “Here’s a pretty pickle!” and bustled to make way for a man
      well known to them as Ned Crummins, the upholsterer’s man, on whose back
      hung an article of furniture, the condition of which, with a condensed
      brevity of humour worthy of literary admiration, he displayed by mutely
      turning himself about as he entered.
    </p>
<p>
      “Smashed!” was the general outcry.
    </p>
<p>
      “I ran slap into him,” said the gentleman. “Who the deuce!—no bones
      broken, that’s one thing. The fellow—there, look at him: he’s like a
      glass tortoise.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s a chiwal glass,” Crickledon remarked, and laid finger on the star in
      the centre.
    </p>
<p>
      “Gentleman ran slap into me,” said Crummins, depositing the frame on the
      floor of the shop.
    </p>
<p>
      “Never had such a shock in my life,” continued the gentleman. “Upon my
      soul, I took him for a door: I did indeed. A kind of light flashed from
      one of your houses here, and in the pitch dark I thought I was at the door
      of old Mart Tinman’s house, and dash me if I did n’t go in—crash!
      But what the deuce do you do, carrying that great big looking-glass at
      night, man? And, look here tell me; how was it you happened to be going
      glass foremost when you’d got the glass on your back?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, ‘t ain’t my fault, I knows that,” rejoined Crummins. “I came along
      as careful as a man could. I was just going to bawl out to Master Tinman,
      ‘I knows the way, never fear me’; for I thinks I hears him call from his
      house, ‘Do ye see the way?’ and into me this gentleman runs all his might,
      and smash goes the glass. I was just ten steps from Master Tinman’s gate,
      and that careful, I reckoned every foot I put down, that I was; I knows I
      did, though.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why, it was me calling, ‘I’m sure I can’t see the way.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      “You heard me, you donkey!” retorted the bearded gentleman. “What was the
      good of your turning that glass against me in the very nick when I dashed
      on you?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, ‘t ain’t my fault, I swear,” said Crummins. “The wind catches
      voices so on a pitch dark night, you never can tell whether they be on one
      shoulder or the other. And if I’m to go and lose my place through no fault
      of mine——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Have n’t I told you, sir, I’m going to pay the damage? Here,” said the
      gentleman, fumbling at his waistcoat, “here, take this card. Read it.”
     </p>
<p>
      For the first time during the scene in the carpenter’s shop, a certain
      pomposity swelled the gentleman’s tone. His delivery of the card appeared
      to act on him like the flourish of a trumpet before great men.
    </p>
<p>
      “Van Diemen Smith,” he proclaimed himself for the assistance of Ned
      Crummins in his task; the latter’s look of sad concern on receiving the
      card seeming to declare an unscholarly conscience.
    </p>
<p>
      An anxious feminine voice was heard close beside Mr. Van Diemen Smith.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, papa, has there been an accident? Are you hurt?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not a bit, Netty; not a bit. Walked into a big looking-glass in the dark,
      that’s all. A matter of eight or ten pound, and that won’t stump us. But
      these are what I call queer doings in Old England, when you can’t take a
      step in the dark, on the seashore without plunging bang into a glass. And
      it looks like bad luck to my visit to old Mart Tinman.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Can you,” he addressed the company, “tell me of a clean, wholesome
      lodging-house? I was thinking of flinging myself, body and baggage, on
      your mayor, or whatever he is—my old schoolmate; but I don’t so much
      like this beginning. A couple of bed-rooms and sitting-room; clean sheets,
      well aired; good food, well cooked; payment per week in advance.”
     </p>
<p>
      The pebble dropped into deep water speaks of its depth by the tardy
      arrival of bubbles on the surface, and, in like manner, the very simple
      question put by Mr. Van Diemen Smith pursued its course of penetration in
      the assembled mind in the carpenter’s shop for a considerable period, with
      no sign to show that it had reached the bottom.
    </p>
<p>
      “Surely, papa, we can go to an inn? There must be some hotel,” said his
      daughter.
    </p>
<p>
      “There’s good accommodation at the Cliff Hotel hard by,” said Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “But,” said one of his friends, “if you don’t want to go so far, sir,
      there’s Master Crickledon’s own house next door, and his wife lets
      lodgings, and there’s not a better cook along this coast.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then why did n’t the man mention it? Is he afraid of having me?” asked
      Mr. Smith, a little thunderingly. “I may n’t be known much yet in England;
      but I’ll tell you, you inquire the route to Mr. Van Diemen Smith over
      there in Australia.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, papa,” interrupted his daughter, “only you must consider that it may
      not be convenient to take us in at this hour—so late.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s not that, miss, begging your pardon,” said Crickledon. “I make a
      point of never recommending my own house. That’s where it is. Otherwise
      you’re welcome to try us.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I was thinking of falling bounce on my old schoolmate, and putting Old
      English hospitality to the proof,” Mr. Smith meditated. “But it’s late.
      Yes, and that confounded glass! No, we’ll bide with you, Mr. Carpenter.
      I’ll send my card across to Mart Tinman to-morrow, and set him agog at his
      breakfast.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mr. Van Diemen Smith waved his hand for Crickledon to lead the way.
    </p>
<p>
      Hereupon Ned Crummins looked up from the card he had been turning over and
      over, more and more like one arriving at a condemnatory judgment of a
      fish.
    </p>
<p>
      “I can’t go and give my master a card instead of his glass,” he remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, that reminds me; and I should like to know what you meant by
      bringing that glass away from Mr. Tinman’s house at night,” said Mr.
      Smith. “If I’m to pay for it, I’ve a right to know. What’s the meaning of
      moving it at night? Eh, let’s hear. Night’s not the time for moving big
      glasses like that. I’m not so sure I haven’t got a case.”
     </p>
<p>
      “If you’ll step round to my master along o’ me, sir,” said Crummins,
      “perhaps he’ll explain.”
     </p>
<p>
      Crummins was requested to state who his master was, and he replied,
      “Phippun and Company;” but Mr. Smith positively refused to go with him.
    </p>
<p>
      “But here,” said he, “is a crown for you, for you’re a civil fellow.
      You’ll know where to find me in the morning; and mind, I shall expect
      Phippun and Company to give me a very good account of their reason for
      moving a big looking-glass on a night like this. There, be off.”
     </p>
<p>
      The crown-piece in his hand effected a genial change in Crummins’ 
      disposition to communicate. Crickledon spoke to him about the glass; two
      or three of the others present jogged him. “What did Mr. Tinman want by
      having the glass moved so late in the day, Ned? Your master wasn’t nervous
      about his property, was he?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not he,” said Crummins, and began to suck down his upper lip and agitate
      his eyelids and stand uneasily, glimmering signs of the setting in of the
      tide of narration.
    </p>
<p>
      He caught the eye of Mr. Smith, then looked abashed at Miss.
    </p>
<p>
      Crickledon saw his dilemma. “Say what’s uppermost, Ned; never mind how you
      says it. English is English. Mr. Tinman sent for you to take the glass
      away, now, did n’t he?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He did,” said Crummins.
    </p>
<p>
      “And you went to him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ay, that I did.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And he fastened the chiwal glass upon your back”
     </p>
<p>
      “He did that.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That’s all plain sailing. Had he bought the glass?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, he had n’t bought it. He’d hired it.”
     </p>
<p>
      As when upon an enforced visit to the dentist, people have had one tooth
      out, the remaining offenders are more willingly submitted to the
      operation, insomuch that a poetical licence might hazard the statement
      that they shed them like leaves of the tree, so Crummins, who had shrunk
      from speech, now volunteered whole sentences in succession, and how
      important they were deemed by his fellow-townsman, Mr. Smith, and
      especially Miss Annette Smith, could perceive in their ejaculations,
      before they themselves were drawn into the strong current of interest.
    </p>
<p>
      And this was the matter: Tinman had hired the glass for three days.
      Latish, on the very first day of the hiring, close upon dark, he had
      despatched imperative orders to Phippun and Company to take the glass out
      of his house on the spot. And why? Because, as he maintained, there was a
      fault in the glass causing an incongruous and absurd reflection; and he
      was at that moment awaiting the arrival of another chiwal-glass.
    </p>
<p>
      “Cut along, Ned,” said Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “What the deuce does he want with a chiwal-glass at all?” cried Mr. Smith,
      endangering the flow of the story by suggesting to the narrator that he
      must “hark back,” which to him was equivalent to the jumping of a chasm
      hindward. Happily his brain had seized a picture:
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Tinman, he’s a-standin’ in his best Court suit.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mr. Tinmau’s old schoolmate gave a jump; and no wonder.
    </p>
<p>
      “Standing?” he cried; and as the act of standing was really not
      extraordinary, he fixed upon the suit: “Court?”
     </p>
<p>
      “So Mrs. Cavely told me, it was what he was standin’ in, and as I found ‘m
      I left ‘m,” said Crummins.
    </p>
<p>
      “He’s standing in it now?” said Mr. Van Diemen Smith, with a great gape.
    </p>
<p>
      Crummins doggedly repeated the statement. Many would have ornamented it in
      the repetition, but he was for bare flat truth.
    </p>
<p>
      “He must be precious proud of having a Court suit,” said Mr. Smith, and
      gazed at his daughter so glassily that she smiled, though she was
      impatient to proceed to Mrs. Crickledon’s lodgings.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! there’s where it is?” interjected the carpenter, with a funny frown
      at a low word from Ned Crummins. “Practicing, is he? Mr. Tinman’s
      practicing before the glass preparatory to his going to the palace in
      London.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He gave me a shillin’,” said Crummins.
    </p>
<p>
      Crickledon comprehended him immediately. “We sha’n’t speak about it, Ned.”
     </p>
<p>
      What did you see? was thus cautiously suggested.
    </p>
<p>
      The shilling was on Crummins’ tongue to check his betrayal of the secret
      scene. But remembering that he had only witnessed it by accident, and that
      Mr. Tinman had not completely taken him into his confidence, he thrust his
      hand down his pocket to finger the crown-piece lying in fellowship with
      the coin it multiplied five times, and was inspired to think himself at
      liberty to say: “All I saw was when the door opened. Not the house-door.
      It was the parlour-door. I saw him walk up to the glass, and walk back
      from the glass. And when he’d got up to the glass he bowed, he did, and he
      went back’ards just so.”
     </p>
<p>
      Doubtless the presence of a lady was the active agent that prevented
      Crummins from doubling his body entirely, and giving more than a rapid
      indication of the posture of Mr. Tinman in his retreat before the glass.
      But it was a glimpse of broad burlesque, and though it was received with
      becoming sobriety by the men in the carpenter’s shop, Annette plucked at
      her father’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
      She could not get him to depart. That picture of his old schoolmate Martin
      Tinman practicing before a chiwal glass to present himself at the palace
      in his Court suit, seemed to stupefy his Australian intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      “What right has he got to go to Court?” Mr. Van Diemen Smith inquired,
      like the foreigner he had become through exile.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Tinman’s bailiff of the town,” said Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “And what was his objection to that glass I smashed?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He’s rather an irritable gentleman,” Crickledon murmured, and turned to
      Crummins.
    </p>
<p>
      Crummins growled: “He said it was misty, and gave him a twist.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What a big fool he must be! eh?” Mr. Smith glanced at Crickledon and the
      other faces for the verdict of Tinman’s townsmen upon his character.
    </p>
<p>
      They had grounds for thinking differently of Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “He’s no fool,” said Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      Another shook his head. “Sharp at a bargain.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That he be,” said the chorus.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Smith was informed that Mr. Tinman would probably end by buying up
      half the town.
    </p>
<p>
      “Then,” said Mr. Smith, “he can afford to pay half the money for that
      glass, and pay he shall.”
     </p>
<p>
      A serious view of the recent catastrophe was presented by his declaration.
    </p>
<p>
      In the midst of a colloquy regarding the cost of the glass, during which
      it began to be seen by Mr. Tinman’s townsmen that there was laughing-stuff
      for a year or so in the scene witnessed by Crummins, if they postponed a
      bit their right to the laugh and took it in doses, Annette induced her
      father to signal to Crickledon his readiness to go and see the lodgings.
      No sooner had he done it than he said, “What on earth made us wait all
      this time here? I’m hungry, my dear; I want supper.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That is because you have had a disappointment. I know you, papa,” said
      Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, it’s rather a damper about old Mart Tinman,” her father assented.
      “Or else I have n’t recovered the shock of smashing that glass, and visit
      it on him. But, upon my honour, he’s my only friend in England, I have n’t
      a single relative that I know of, and to come and find your only friend
      making a donkey of himself, is enough to make a man think of eating and
      drinking.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette murmured reproachfully: “We can hardly say he is our only friend
      in England, papa, can we?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do you mean that young fellow? You’ll take my appetite away if you talk
      of him. He’s a stranger. I don’t believe he’s worth a penny. He owns he’s
      what he calls a journalist.”
     </p>
<p>
      These latter remarks were hurriedly exchanged at the threshold of
      Crickledon’s house.
    </p>
<p>
      “It don’t look promising,” said Mr. Smith.
    </p>
<p>
      “I didn’t recommend it,” said Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why the deuce do you let your lodgings, then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “People who have come once come again.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh! I am in England,” Annette sighed joyfully, feeling at home in some
      trait she had detected in Crickledon.

<h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
<p>
      The story of the shattered chiwal-glass and the visit of Tinman’s old
      schoolmate fresh from Australia, was at many a breakfast-table before.
      Tinman heard a word of it, and when he did he had no time to spare for
      such incidents, for he was reading to his widowed sister Martha, in an
      impressive tone, at a tolerably high pitch of the voice, and with a
      suppressed excitement that shook away all things external from his mind as
      violently as it agitated his body. Not the waves without but the engine
      within it is which gives the shock and tremor to the crazy steamer,
      forcing it to cut through the waves and scatter them to spray; and so did
      Martin Tinman make light of the external attack of the card of VAN DIEMEN
      SMITH, and its pencilled line: “An old chum of yours, eh, matey?” Even the
      communication of Phippun &amp; Co. concerning the chiwal-glass, failed to
      divert him from his particular task. It was indeed a public duty; and the
      chiwal-glass, though pertaining to it, was a private business. He that has
      broken the glass, let that man pay for it, he pronounced—no doubt in
      simpler fashion, being at his ease in his home, but with the serenity of
      one uplifted. As to the name VAN DIEMEN SMITH, he knew it not, and so he
      said to himself while accurately recollecting the identity of the old chum
      who alone of men would have thought of writing eh, matey?
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Van Diemen Smith did not present the card in person. “At
      Crickledon’s,” he wrote, apparently expecting the bailiff of the town to
      rush over to him before knowing who he was.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman was far too busy. Anybody can read plain penmanship or print, but
      ask anybody not a Cabinet Minister or a Lord-in-Waiting to read out loud
      and clear in a Palace, before a Throne. Oh! the nature of reading is
      distorted in a trice, and as Tinman said to his worthy sister: “I can do
      it, but I must lose no time in preparing myself.” Again, at a reperusal,
      he informed her: “I must habituate myself.” For this purpose he had put on
      the suit overnight.
    </p>
<p>
      The articulation of faultless English was his object. His sister Martha
      sat vice-regally to receive his loyal congratulations on the illustrious
      marriage, and she was pensive, less nervous than her brother from not
      having to speak continuously, yet somewhat perturbed. She also had her
      task, and it was to avoid thinking herself the Person addressed by her
      suppliant brother, while at the same time she took possession of the
      scholarly training and perfect knowledge of diction and rules of
      pronunciation which would infallibly be brought to bear on him in the
      terrible hour of the delivery of the Address. It was no small task
      moreover to be compelled to listen right through to the end of the
      Address, before the very gentlest word of criticism was allowed. She did
      not exactly complain of the renewal of the rehearsal: a fatigue can be
      endured when it is a joy. What vexed her was her failing memory for the
      points of objection, as in her imagined High Seat she conceived them; for,
      in painful truth, the instant her brother had finished she entirely lost
      her acuteness of ear, and with that her recollection: so there was nothing
      to do but to say: “Excellent! Quite unobjectionable, dear Martin, quite:”
       so she said, and emphatically; but the addition of the word “only” was
      printed on her contracted brow, and every faculty of Tinman’s mind and
      nature being at strain just then, he asked her testily: “What now? what’s
      the fault now?” She assured him with languor that there was not a fault.
      “It’s not your way of talking,” said he, and what he said was true. His
      discernment was extraordinary; generally he noticed nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      Not only were his perceptions quickened by the preparations for the day of
      great splendour: day of a great furnace to be passed through likewise!—he,
      was learning English at an astonishing rate into the bargain. A
      pronouncing Dictionary lay open on his table. To this he flew at a hint of
      a contrary method, and disputes, verifications and triumphs on one side
      and the other ensued between brother and sister. In his heart the agitated
      man believed his sister to be a misleading guide. He dared not say it, he
      thought it, and previous to his African travel through the Dictionary he
      had thought his sister infallible on these points. He dared not say it,
      because he knew no one else before whom he could practice, and as it was
      confidence that he chiefly wanted—above all things, confidence and
      confidence comes of practice, he preferred the going on with his practice
      to an absolute certainty as to correctness.
    </p>
<p>
      At midday came another card from Mr. Van Diemen Smith bearing the
      superscription: alias Phil R.
    </p>
<p>
      “Can it be possible,” Tinman asked his sister, “that Philip Ribstone has
      had the audacity to return to this country? I think,” he added, “I am
      right in treating whoever sends me this card as a counterfeit.”
     </p>
<p>
      Martha’s advice was, that he should take no notice of the card.
    </p>
<p>
      “I am seriously engaged,” said Tinman. With a “Now then, dear,” he resumed
      his labours.
    </p>
<p>
      Messages had passed between Tinman and Phippun; and in the afternoon
      Phippun appeared to broach the question of payment for the chiwal-glass.
      He had seen Mr. Van Diemen Smith, had found him very strange, rather
      impracticable. He was obliged to tell Tinman that he must hold him
      responsible for the glass; nor could he send a second until payment was
      made for the first. It really seemed as if Tinman would be compelled, by
      the force of circumstances, to go and shake his old friend by the hand.
      Otherwise one could clearly see the man might be off: he might be off at
      any minute, leaving a legal contention behind him. On the other hand,
      supposing he had come to Crikswich for assistance in money? Friendship is
      a good thing, and so is hospitality, which is an essentially English
      thing, and consequently one that it behoves an Englishman to think it his
      duty to perform, but we do not extend it to paupers. But should a pauper
      get so close to us as to lay hold of us, vowing he was once our friend,
      how shake him loose? Tinman foresaw that it might be a matter of five
      pounds thrown to the dogs, perhaps ten, counting the glass. He put on his
      hat, full of melancholy presentiments; and it was exactly half-past five
      o’clock of the spring afternoon when he knocked at Crickledon’s door.
    </p>
<p>
      Had he looked into Crickledon’s shop as he went by, he would have
      perceived Van Diemen Smith astride a piece of timber, smoking a pipe. Van
      Diemen saw Tinman. His eyes cocked and watered. It is a disgraceful fact
      to record of him without periphrasis. In truth, the bearded fellow was
      almost a woman at heart, and had come from the Antipodes throbbing to slap
      Martin Tinman on the back, squeeze his hand, run over England with him,
      treat him, and talk of old times in the presence of a trotting regiment of
      champagne. That affair of the chiwal-glass had temporarily damped his
      enthusiasm. The absence of a reply to his double transmission of cards had
      wounded him; and something in the look of Tinman disgusted his rough
      taste. But the well-known features recalled the days of youth. Tinman was
      his one living link to the country he admired as the conqueror of the
      world, and imaginatively delighted in as the seat of pleasures, and he
      could not discard the feeling of some love for Tinman without losing his
      grasp of the reason why, he had longed so fervently and travelled so
      breathlessly to return hither. In the days of their youth, Van Diemen had
      been Tinman’s cordial spirit, at whom he sipped for cheerful visions of
      life, and a good honest glow of emotion now and then. Whether it was odd
      or not that the sipper should be oblivious, and the cordial spirit
      heartily reminiscent of those times, we will not stay to inquire.
    </p>
<p>
      Their meeting took place in Crickledon’s shop. Tinman was led in by Mrs.
      Crickledon. His voice made a sound of metal in his throat, and his air was
      that of a man buttoned up to the palate, as he read from the card,
      glancing over his eyelids, “Mr. Van Diemen Smith, I believe.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Phil Ribstone, if you like,” said the other, without rising.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, ah, indeed!” Tinman temperately coughed.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, dear me. So it is. It strikes you as odd?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The change of name,” said Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not nature, though!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ah! Have you been long in England?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Time to run to Helmstone, and on here. You’ve been lucky in business, I
      hear.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thank you; as things go. Do you think of remaining in England?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I’ve got to settle about a glass I broke last night.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ah! I have heard of it. Yes, I fear there will have to be a settlement.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I shall pay half of the damage. You’ll have to stump up your part.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen smiled roguishly.
    </p>
<p>
      “We must discuss that,” said Tinman, smiling too, as a patient in bed may
      smile at a doctor’s joke; for he was, as Crickledon had said of him, no
      fool on practical points, and Van Diemen’s mention of the half-payment
      reassured him as to his old friend’s position in the world, and softly
      thawed him. “Will you dine with me to-day?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t mind if I do. I’ve a girl. You remember little Netty? She’s
      walking out on the beach with a young fellow named Fellingham, whose
      acquaintance we made on the voyage, and has n’t left us long to ourselves.
      Will you have her as well? And I suppose you must ask him. He’s a
      newspaper man; been round the world; seen a lot.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman hesitated. An electrical idea of putting sherry at fifteen
      shillings per dozen on his table instead of the ceremonial wine at
      twenty-five shillings, assisted him to say hospitably, “Oh! ah! yes; any
      friend of yours.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And now perhaps you’ll shake my fist,” said Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      “With pleasure,” said Tinman. “It was your change of name, you know,
      Philip.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look here, Martin. Van Diemen Smith was a convict, and my benefactor. Why
      the deuce he was so fond of that name, I can’t tell you; but his dying
      wish was for me to take it and carry it on. He left me his fortune, for
      Van Diemen Smith to enjoy life, as he never did, poor fellow, when he was
      alive. The money was got honestly, by hard labour at a store. He did evil
      once, and repented after. But, by Heaven!”—Van Diemen jumped up and
      thundered out of a broad chest—“the man was one of the finest hearts
      that ever beat. He was! and I’m proud of him. When he died, I turned my
      thoughts home to Old England and you, Martin.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh!” said Tinman; and reminded by Van Diemen’s way of speaking, that
      cordiality was expected of him, he shook his limbs to some briskness, and
      continued, “Well, yes, we must all die in our native land if we can. I
      hope you’re comfortable in your lodgings?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I’ll give you one of Mrs. Crickledon’s dinners to try. You’re as good as
      mayor of this town, I hear?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am the bailiff of the town,” said Mr. Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “You’re going to Court, I’m told.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The appointment,” replied Mr. Tinman, “will soon be made. I have not yet
      an appointed day.”
     </p>
<p>
      On the great highroad of life there is Expectation, and there is
      Attainment, and also there is Envy. Mr. Tinman’s posture stood for
      Attainment shadowing Expectation, and sunning itself in the glass of Envy,
      as he spoke of the appointed day. It was involuntary, and naturally
      evanescent, a momentary view of the spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      He unbent, and begged to be excused for the present, that he might go and
      apprise his sister of guests coming.
    </p>
<p>
      “All right. I daresay we shall see, enough of one another,” said Van
      Diemen. And almost before the creak of Tinman’s heels was deadened on the
      road outside the shop, he put the funny question to Crickledon, “Do you
      box?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I make ‘em,” Crickledon replied.
    </p>
<p>
      “Because I should like to have a go in at something, my friend.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen stretched and yawned.
    </p>
<p>
      Crickledon recommended the taking of a walk.
    </p>
<p>
      “I think I will,” said the other, and turned back abruptly. “How long do
      you work in the day?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Generally, all the hours of light,” Crickledon replied; “and always up to
      supper-time.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You’re healthy and happy?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nothing to complain of.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good appetite?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pretty regular.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You never take a holiday?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Except Sundays.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You’d like to be working then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I won’t say that.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But you’re glad to be up Monday morning?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It feels cheerfuller in the shop.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And carpentering’s your joy?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I think I may say so.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen slapped his thigh. “There’s life in Old England yet!”
     </p>
<p>
      Crickledon eyed him as he walked away to the beach to look for his
      daughter, and conceived that there was a touch of the soldier in him.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<p>
      Annette Smith’s delight in her native England made her see beauty and
      kindness everywhere around her; it put a halo about the house on the
      beach, and thrilled her at Tinman’s table when she heard the thunder of
      the waves hard by. She fancied it had been a most agreeable dinner to her
      father and Mr. Herbert Fellingham—especially to the latter, who had
      laughed very much; and she was astonished to hear them at breakfast both
      complaining of their evening. In answer to which, she exclaimed, “Oh, I
      think the situation of the house is so romantic!”
     </p>
<p>
      “The situation of the host is exceedingly so,” said Mr. Fellingham; “but I
      think his wine the most unromantic liquid I have ever tasted.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It must be that!” cried Van Diemen, puzzled by novel pains in the head.
      “Old Martin woke up a little like his old self after dinner.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He drank sparingly,” said Mr. Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “I am sure you were satirical last night,” Annette said reproachfully.
    </p>
<p>
      “On the contrary, I told him I thought he was in a romantic situation.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But I have had a French mademoiselle for my governess and an Oxford
      gentleman for my tutor; and I know you accepted French and English from
      Mr. Tinman and his sister that I should not have approved.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Netty,” said Van Diemen, “has had the best instruction money could
      procure; and if she says you were satirical, you may depend on it you
      were.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, in that case, of course!” Mr. Fellingham rejoined. “Who could help
      it?”
     </p>
<p>
      He thought himself warranted in giving the rein to his wicked satirical
      spirit, and talked lightly of the accidental character of the letter H in
      Tinman’s pronunciation; of how, like somebody else’s hat in a high wind,
      it descended on somebody else’s head, and of how his words walked about
      asking one another who they were and what they were doing, danced together
      madly, snapping their fingers at signification; and so forth. He was
      flippant.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette glanced at her father, and dropped her eyelids.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Fellingham perceived that he was enjoined to be on his guard.
    </p>
<p>
      He went one step farther in his fun; upon which Van Diemen said, with a
      frown, “If you please!”
     </p>
<p>
      Nothing could withstand that.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hang old Mart Tinman’s wine!” Van Diemen burst out in the dead pause. “My
      head’s a bullet. I’m in a shocking bad temper. I can hardly see. I’m
      bilious.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mr. Fellingham counselled his lying down for an hour, and he went
      grumbling, complaining of Mart Tinman’s incredulity about the towering
      beauty of a place in Australia called Gippsland.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette confided to Mr. Fellingham, as soon as they were alone, the
      chivalrous nature of her father in his friendships, and his indisposition
      to hear a satirical remark upon his old schoolmate, the moment he
      understood it to be satire.
    </p>
<p>
      Fellingham pleaded: “The man’s a perfect burlesque. He’s as distinctly
      made to be laughed at as a mask in a pantomime.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Papa will not think so,” said Annette; “and papa has been told that he is
      not to be laughed at as a man of business.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do you prize him for that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am no judge. I am too happy to be in England to be a judge of
      anything.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You did not touch his wine!”
     </p>
<p>
      “You men attach so much importance to wine!”
     </p>
<p>
      “They do say that powders is a good thing after Mr. Tinman’s wine,”
       observed Mrs. Crickledon, who had come into the sitting-room to take away
      the breakfast things.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Fellingham gave a peal of laughter; but Mrs Crickledon bade him be
      hushed, for Mr. Van Diemen Smith had gone to lay down his poor aching head
      on his pillow. Annette ran upstairs to speak to her father about a doctor.
    </p>
<p>
      During her absence, Mr. Fellingham received the popular portrait of Mr.
      Tinman from the lips of Mrs. Crickledon. He subsequently strolled to the
      carpenter’s shop, and endeavoured to get a confirmation of it.
    </p>
<p>
      “My wife talks too much,” said Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      When questioned by a gentleman, however, he was naturally bound to answer
      to the extent of his knowledge.
    </p>
<p>
      “What a funny old country it is!” Mr. Fellingham said to Annette, on their
      walk to the beach.
    </p>
<p>
      She implored him not to laugh at anything English.
    </p>
<p>
      “I don’t, I assure you,” said he. “I love the country, too. But when one
      comes back from abroad, and plunges into their daily life, it’s difficult
      to retain the real figure of the old country seen from outside, and one
      has to remember half a dozen great names to right oneself. And Englishmen
      are so funny! Your father comes here to see his old friend, and begins
      boasting of the Gippsland he has left behind. Tinman immediately brags of
      Helvellyn, and they fling mountains at one another till, on their first
      evening together, there’s earthquake and rupture—they were nearly at
      fisticuffs at one time.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh! surely no,” said Annette. “I did not hear them. They were good
      friends when you came to the drawingroom. Perhaps the wine did affect poor
      papa, if it was bad wine. I wish men would never drink any. How much
      happier they would be.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But then there would cease to be social meetings in England. What should
      we do?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I know that is a sneer; and you were nearly as enthusiastic as I was on
      board the vessel,” Annette said, sadly.
    </p>
<p>
      “Quite true. I was. But see what quaint creatures we have about us! Tinman
      practicing in his Court suit before the chiwal-glass! And that good
      fellow, the carpenter, Crickledon, who has lived with the sea fronting him
      all his life, and has never been in a boat, and he confesses he has only
      once gone inland, and has never seen an acorn!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I wish I could see one—of a real English oak,” said Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “And after being in England a few months you will be sighing for the
      Continent.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Never!”
     </p>
<p>
      “You think you will be quite contented here?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am sure I shall be. May papa and I never be exiles again! I did not
      feel it when I was three years old, going out to Australia; but it would
      be like death to me now. Oh!” Annette shivered, as with the exile’s chill.
    </p>
<p>
      “On my honour,” said Mr. Fellingham, as softly as he could with the wind
      in his teeth, “I love the old country ten times more from your love of
      it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That is not how I want England to be loved,” returned Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “The love is in your hands.”
     </p>
<p>
      She seemed indifferent on hearing it.
    </p>
<p>
      He should have seen that the way to woo her was to humour her
      prepossession by another passion. He could feel that it ennobled her in
      the abstract, but a latent spite at Tinman on account of his wine, to
      which he continued angrily to attribute as unwonted dizziness of the head
      and slight irascibility, made him urgent in his desire that she should
      separate herself from Tinman and his sister by the sharp division of
      derision.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette declined to laugh at the most risible caricatures of Tinman. In
      her antagonism she forced her simplicity so far as to say that she did not
      think him absurd. And supposing Mr. Tinman to have proposed to the titled
      widow, Lady Ray, as she had heard, and to other ladies young and
      middle-aged in the neighbourhood, why should he not, if he wished to
      marry? If he was economical, surely he had a right to manage his own
      affairs. Her dread was lest Mr. Tinman and her father should quarrel over
      the payment for the broken chiwal-glass: that she honestly admitted, and
      Fellingham was so indiscreet as to roar aloud, not so very cordially.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette thought him unkindly satirical; and his thoughts of her reduced
      her to the condition of a commonplace girl with expressive eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      She had to return to her father. Mr. Fellingham took a walk on the springy
      turf along the cliffs; and “certainly she is a commonplace girl,” he began
      by reflecting; with a side eye at the fact that his meditations were
      excited by Tinman’s poisoning of his bile. “A girl who can’t see the
      absurdity of Tinman must be destitute of common intelligence.” After a
      while he sniffed the fine sharp air of mingled earth and sea delightedly,
      and he strode back to the town late in the afternoon, laughing at himself
      in scorn of his wretched susceptibility to bilious impressions, and really
      all but hating Tinman as the cause of his weakness—in the manner of
      the criminal hating the detective, perhaps. He cast it altogether on
      Tinman that Annette’s complexion of character had become discoloured to
      his mind; for, in spite of the physical freshness with which he returned
      to her society, he was incapable of throwing off the idea of her being
      commonplace; and it was with regret that he acknowledged he had gained
      from his walk only a higher opinion of himself.
    </p>
<p>
      Her father was the victim of a sick headache, [Migraine—D.W.]and
      lay, a groaning man, on his bed, ministered to by Mrs. Crickledon chiefly.
      Annette had to conduct the business with Mr. Phippun and Mr. Tinman as to
      payment for the chiwal-glass. She was commissioned to offer half the price
      for the glass on her father’s part; more he would not pay. Tinman and
      Phippun sat with her in Crickledon’s cottage, and Mrs. Crickledon brought
      down two messages from her invalid, each positive, to the effect that he
      would fight with all the arms of English law rather than yield his point.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman declared it to be quite out of the question that he should pay a
      penny. Phippun vowed that from one or the other of them he would have the
      money.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette naturally was in deep distress, and Fellingham postponed the
      discussion to the morrow.
    </p>
<p>
      Even after such a taste of Tinman as that, Annette could not be induced to
      join in deriding him privately. She looked pained by Mr. Fellingham’s
      cruel jests. It was monstrous, Fellingham considered, that he should draw
      on himself a second reprimand from Van Diemen Smith, while they were
      consulting in entire agreement upon the case of the chiwal-glass.
    </p>
<p>
      “I must tell you this, mister sir,” said Van Diemen, “I like you, but I’ll
      be straightforward and truthful, or I’m not worthy the name of Englishman;
      and I do like you, or I should n’t have given you leave to come down here
      after us two. You must respect my friend if you care for my respect.
      That’s it. There it is. Now you know my conditions.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I ‘m afraid I can’t sign the treaty,” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “Here’s more,” said Van Diemen. “I’m a chilly man myself if I hear a laugh
      and think I know the aim of it. I’ll meet what you like except scorn. I
      can’t stand contempt. So I feel for another. And now you know.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It puts a stopper on the play of fancy, and checks the throwing off of
      steam,” Fellingham remonstrated. “I promise to do my best, but of all the
      men I’ve ever met in my life—Tinman!—the ridiculous! Pray
      pardon me; but the donkey and his looking-glass! The glass was misty! He—as
      particular about his reflection in the glass as a poet with his verses!
      Advance, retire, bow; and such murder of the Queen’s English in the very
      presence! If I thought he was going to take his wine with him, I’d have
      him arrested for high treason.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You’ve chosen, and you know what you best like,” said Van Diemen,
      pointing his accents—by which is produced the awkward pause, the
      pitfall of conversation, and sometimes of amity.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus it happened that Mr. Herbert Fellingham journeyed back to London a
      day earlier than he had intended, and without saying what he meant to say.

<h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
<p>
      A month later, after a night of sharp frost on the verge of the warmer
      days of spring, Mr. Fellingham entered Crikswich under a sky of perfect
      blue that was in brilliant harmony with the green downs, the white cliffs
      and sparkling sea, and no doubt it was the beauty before his eyes which
      persuaded him of his delusion in having taken Annette for a commonplace
      girl. He had come in a merely curious mood to discover whether she was one
      or not. Who but a commonplace girl would care to reside in Crikswich, he
      had asked himself; and now he was full sure that no commonplace girl would
      ever have had the idea. Exquisitely simple, she certainly was; but that
      may well be a distinction in a young lady whose eyes are expressive.
    </p>
<p>
      The sound of sawing attracted him to Crickledon’s shop, and the
      industrious carpenter soon put him on the tide of affairs.
    </p>
<p>
      Crickledon pointed to the house on the beach as the place where Mr. Van
      Diemen Smith and his daughter were staying.
    </p>
<p>
      “Dear me! and how does he look?” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “Our town seems to agree with him, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, I must not say any more, I suppose.” Fellingham checked his tongue.
      “How have they settled that dispute about the chiwal-glass?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Tinman had to give way.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Really.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But,” Crickledon stopped work, “Mr. Tinman sold him a meadow.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I see.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Smith has been buying a goodish bit of ground here. They tell me he’s
      about purchasing Elba. He has bought the Crouch. He and Mr. Tinman are
      always out together. They’re over at Helmstone now. They’ve been to
      London.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Are they likely to be back to-day?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Certain, I should think. Mr. Tinman has to be in London to-morrow.”
     </p>
<p>
      Crickledon looked. He was not the man to look artful, but there was a
      lighted corner in his look that revived Fellingham’s recollections, and
      the latter burst out:
    </p>
<p>
      “The Address? I ‘d half forgotten it. That’s not over yet? Has he been
      practicing much?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No more glasses ha’ been broken.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And how is your wife, Crickledon?”
     </p>
<p>
      “She’s at home, sir, ready for a talk, if you’ve a mind to try her.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Crickledon proved to be very ready. “That Tinman,” was her theme. He
      had taken away her lodgers, and she knew his objects. Mr. Smith repented
      of leaving her, she knew, though he dared not say it in plain words. She
      knew Miss Smith was tired to death of constant companionship with Mrs.
      Cavely, Tinman’s sister. She generally came once in the day just to escape
      from Mrs. Cavely, who would not, bless you! step into a cottager’s house
      where she was not allowed to patronize. Fortunately Miss Smith had induced
      her father to get his own wine from the merchants.
    </p>
<p>
      “A happy resolution,” said Fellingham; “and a saving one.”
     </p>
<p>
      He heard further that Mr. Smith would take possession of the Crouch next
      month, and that Mrs. Cavely hung over Miss Smith like a kite.
    </p>
<p>
      “And that old Tinman, old enough to be her father!” said Mrs. Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      She dealt in the flashes which connect ideas. Fellingham, though a man,
      and an Englishman, was nervously wakeful enough to see the connection.
    </p>
<p>
      “They’ll have to consult the young lady first, ma’am.”
     </p>
<p>
      “If it’s her father’s nod she’ll bow to it; now mark me,” Mrs. Crickledon
      said, with emphasis. “She’s a young lady who thinks for herself, but she
      takes her start from her father where it’s feeling. And he’s gone
      stone-blind over that Tinman.”
     </p>
<p>
      While they were speaking, Annette appeared.
    </p>
<p>
      “I saw you,” she said to Fellingham; gladly and openly, in the most
      commonplace manner.
    </p>
<p>
      “Are you going to give me a walk along the beach?” said he.
    </p>
<p>
      She proposed the country behind the town, and that was quite as much to
      his taste. But it was not a happy walk. He had decided that he admired
      her, and the notion of having Tinman for a rival annoyed him. He
      overflowed with ridicule of Tinman, and this was distressing to Annette,
      because not only did she see that he would not control himself before her
      father, but he kindled her own satirical spirit in opposition to her
      father’s friendly sentiments toward his old schoolmate.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Tinman has been extremely hospitable to us,” she said, a little
      coldly.
    </p>
<p>
      “May I ask you, has he consented to receive instruction in deportment and
      pronunciation?”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette did not answer.
    </p>
<p>
      “If practice makes perfect, he must be near the mark by this time.”
     </p>
<p>
      She continued silent.
    </p>
<p>
      “I dare say, in domestic life, he’s as amiable as he is hospitable, and it
      must be a daily gratification to see him in his Court suit.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I have not seen him in his Court suit.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That is his coyness.”
     </p>
<p>
      “People talk of those things.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The common people scandalize the great, about whom they know nothing, you
      mean! I am sure that is true, and living in Courts one must be keenly
      aware of it. But what a splendid sky and-sea!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Is it not?”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette echoed his false rapture with a candour that melted him.
    </p>
<p>
      He was preparing to make up for lost time, when the wild waving of a
      parasol down a road to the right, coming from the town, caused Annette to
      stop and say, “I think that must be Mrs. Cavely. We ought to meet her.”
     </p>
<p>
      Fellingham asked why.
    </p>
<p>
      “She is so fond of walks,” Anisette replied, with a tooth on her lip
    </p>
<p>
      Fellingham thought she seemed fond of runs.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Cavely joined them, breathless. “My dear! the pace you go at!” she
      shouted. “I saw you starting. I followed, I ran, I tore along. I feared I
      never should catch you. And to lose such a morning of English scenery!
    </p>
<p>
      “Is it not heavenly?”
     </p>
<p>
      “One can’t say more,” Fellingham observed, bowing.
    </p>
<p>
      “I am sure I am very glad to see you again, sir. You enjoy Crikswich?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Once visited, always desired, like Venice, ma’am. May I venture to
      inquire whether Mr. Tinman has presented his Address?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The day after to-morrow. The appointment is made with him,” said Mrs.
      Cavely, more officially in manner, “for the day after to-morrow. He is
      excited, as you may well believe. But Mr. Smith is an immense relief to
      him—the very distraction he wanted. We have become one family, you
      know.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Indeed, ma’am, I did not know it,” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      The communication imparted such satiric venom to his further remarks, that
      Annette resolved to break her walk and dismiss him for the day.
    </p>
<p>
      He called at the house on the beach after the dinner-hour, to see Mr. Van
      Diemen Smith, when there was literally a duel between him and Tinman; for
      Van Diemen’s contribution to the table was champagne, and that had been
      drunk, but Tinman’s sherry remained. Tinman would insist on Fellingham’s
      taking a glass. Fellingham parried him with a sedate gravity of irony that
      was painfully perceptible to Anisette. Van Diemen at last backed Tinman’s
      hospitable intent, and, to Fellingham’s astonishment, he found that he had
      been supposed by these two men to be bashfully retreating from a seductive
      offer all the time that his tricks of fence and transpiercings of one of
      them had been marvels of skill.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman pushed the glass into his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      “You have spilt some,” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “It won’t hurt the carpet,” said Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Won’t it?” Fellingham gazed at the carpet, as if expecting a flame to
      arise.
    </p>
<p>
      He then related the tale of the magnanimous Alexander drinking off the
      potion, in scorn of the slanderer, to show faith in his friend.
    </p>
<p>
      “Alexander—Who was that?” said Tinman, foiled in his historical
      recollections by the absence of the surname.
    </p>
<p>
      “General Alexander,” said Fellingham. “Alexander Philipson, or he declared
      it was Joveson; and very fond of wine. But his sherry did for him at
      last.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ah! he drank too much, then,” said Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Of his own!”
     </p>
<p>
      Anisette admonished the vindictive young gentleman by saying, “How long do
      you stay in Crikswich, Mr. Fellingham?”
     </p>
<p>
      He had grossly misconducted himself. But an adversary at once offensive
      and helpless provokes brutality. Anisette prudently avoided letting her
      father understand that satire was in the air; and neither he nor Tinman
      was conscious of it exactly: yet both shrank within themselves under the
      sensation of a devilish blast blowing. Fellingham accompanied them and
      certain jurats to London next day.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, if you like: when a mayor visits Majesty, it is an important
      circumstance, and you are at liberty to argue at length that it means more
      than a desire on his part to show his writing power and his reading power:
      it is full of comfort the people, as an exhibition of their majesty
      likewise; and it is an encouragement to men to strive to become mayors,
      bailiffs, or prime men of any sort; but a stress in the reporting of it—the
      making it appear too important a circumstance—will surely breathe
      the intimation to a politically-minded people that satire is in the air,
      and however dearly they cherish the privilege of knocking at the first
      door of the kingdom, and walking ceremoniously in to read their writings,
      they will, if they are not in one of their moods for prostration, laugh.
      They will laugh at the report.
    </p>
<p>
      All the greater reason is it that we should not indulge them at such
      periods; and I say woe’s me for any brother of the pen, and one in some
      esteem, who dressed the report of that presentation of the Address of
      congratulation by Mr. Bailiff Tinman, of Crikswich! Herbert Fellingham
      wreaked his personal spite on Tinman. He should have bethought him that it
      involved another than Tinman that is to say, an office—which the
      fitful beast rejoices to paw and play with contemptuously now and then,
      one may think, as a solace to his pride, and an indemnification for those
      caprices of abject worship so strongly recalling the days we see through
      Mr. Darwin’s glasses.
    </p>
<p>
      He should not have written the report. It sent a titter over England. He
      was so unwise as to despatch a copy of the newspaper containing it to Van
      Diemen Smith. Van Diemen perused it with satisfaction. So did Tinman. Both
      of these praised the able young writer. But they handed the paper to the
      Coastguard Lieutenant, who asked Tinman how he liked it; and visitors were
      beginning to drop in to Crikswich, who made a point of asking for a sight
      of the chief man; and then came a comic publication, all in the Republican
      tone of the time, with Man’s Dignity for the standpoint, and the wheezy
      laughter residing in old puns to back it, in eulogy of the satiric report
      of the famous Address of congratulation of the Bailiff of Crikswich.
    </p>
<p>
      “Annette,” Van Diemen said to his daughter, “you’ll not encourage that
      newspaper fellow to come down here any more. He had his warning.”
     </p>

<h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<p>
      One of the most difficult lessons for spirited young men to learn is, that
      good jokes are not always good policy. They have to be paid for, like good
      dinners, though dinner and joke shall seem to have been at somebody else’s
      expense. Young Fellingham was treated rudely by Van Diemen Smith, and with
      some cold reserve by Annette: in consequence of which he thought her more
      than ever commonplace. He wrote her a letter of playful remonstrance,
      followed by one that appealed to her sentiments.
    </p>
<p>
      But she replied to neither of them. So his visits to Crikswich came to an
      end.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall a girl who has no appreciation of fun affect us? Her expressive
      eyes, and her quaint simplicity, and her enthusiasm for England, haunted
      Mr. Fellingham; being conjured up by contrast with what he met about him.
      But shall a girl who would impose upon us the task of holding in our
      laughter at Tinman be much regretted? There could be no companionship
      between us, Fellingham thought.
    </p>
<p>
      On an excursion to the English Lakes he saw the name of Van Diemen Smith
      in a visitors’ book, and changed his ideas on the subject of
      companionship. Among mountains, or on the sea, or reading history, Annette
      was one in a thousand. He happened to be at a public ball at Helmstone in
      the Winter season, and who but Annette herself came whirling before him on
      the arm of an officer! Fellingham did not miss his chance of talking to
      her. She greeted him gaily, and speaking with the excitement of the dance
      upon her, appeared a stranger to the serious emotions he was willing to
      cherish. She had been to the Lakes and to Scotland. Next summer she was
      going to Wales. All her experiences were delicious. She was insatiable,
      but satisfied.
    </p>
<p>
      “I wish I had been with you,” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “I wish you had,” said she.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Cavely was her chaperon at the ball, and he was not permitted to
      enjoy a lengthened conversation sitting with Annette. What was he to think
      of a girl who could be submissive to Mrs. Cavely, and danced with any
      number of officers, and had no idea save of running incessantly over
      England in the pursuit of pleasure? Her tone of saying, “I wish you had,”
       was that of the most ordinary of wishes, distinctly, if not designedly
      different from his own melodious depth.
    </p>
<p>
      She granted him one waltz, and he talked of her father and his whimsical
      vagrancies and feeling he had a positive liking for Van Diemen, and he
      sagaciously said so.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette’s eyes brightened. “Then why do you never go to see him? He has
      bought Elba. We move into the Hall after Christmas. We are at the Crouch
      at present. Papa will be sure to make you welcome. Do you not know that he
      never forgets a friend or breaks a friendship?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I do, and I love him for it,” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      If he was not greatly mistaken a gentle pressure on the fingers of his
      left hand rewarded him.
    </p>
<p>
      This determined him. It should here be observed that he was by birth the
      superior of Annette’s parentage, and such is the sentiment of a better
      blood that the flattery of her warm touch was needed for him to overlook
      the distinction.
    </p>
<p>
      Two of his visits to Crikswich resulted simply in interviews and
      conversations with Mrs. Crickledon. Van Diemen and his daughter were in
      London with Tinman and Mrs. Cavely, purchasing furniture for Elba Hall.
      Mrs. Crickledon had no scruple in saying, that Mrs. Cavely meant her
      brother to inhabit the Hall, though Mr. Smith had outbid him in the
      purchase. According to her, Tinman and Mr. Smith had their differences;
      for Mr. Smith was a very outspoken gentleman, and had been known to call
      Tinman names that no man of spirit would bear if he was not scheming.
    </p>
<p>
      Fellingham returned to London, where he roamed the streets famous for
      furniture warehouses, in the vain hope of encountering the new owner of
      Elba.
    </p>
<p>
      Failing in this endeavour, he wrote a love-letter to Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      It was her first. She had liked him. Her manner of thinking she might love
      him was through the reflection that no one stood in the way. The letter
      opened a world to her, broader than Great Britain.
    </p>
<p>
      Fellingham begged her, if she thought favourably of him, to prepare her
      father for the purport of his visit. If otherwise, she was to interdict
      the visit with as little delay as possible and cut him adrift.
    </p>
<p>
      A decided line of conduct was imperative. Yet you have seen that she was
      not in love. She was only not unwilling to be in love. And Fellingham was
      just a trifle warmed. Now mark what events will do to light the fires.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen and Tinman, old chums re-united, and both successful in life,
      had nevertheless, as Mrs. Crickledon said, their differences. They
      commenced with an opposition to Tinman’s views regarding the expenditure
      of town moneys. Tinman was ever for devoting them to the patriotic defence
      of “our shores;” whereas Van Diemen, pointing in detestation of the town
      sewerage reeking across the common under the beach, loudly called on him
      to preserve our lives, by way of commencement. Then Van Diemen
      precipitately purchased Elba at a high valuation, and Tinman had expected
      by waiting to buy it at his own valuation, and sell it out of friendly
      consideration to his friend afterwards, for a friendly consideration. Van
      Diemen had joined the hunt. Tinman could not mount a horse. They had not
      quarrelled, but they had snapped about these and other affairs. Van Diemen
      fancied Tinman was jealous of his wealth. Tinman shrewdly suspected Van
      Diemen to be contemptuous of his dignity. He suffered a loss in a loan of
      money; and instead of pitying him, Van Diemen had laughed him to scorn for
      expecting security for investments at ten per cent. The bitterness of the
      pinch to Tinman made him frightfully sensitive to strictures on his
      discretion. In his anguish he told his sister he was ruined, and she
      advised him to marry before the crash. She was aware that he exaggerated,
      but she repeated her advice. She went so far as to name the person. This
      is known, because she was overheard by her housemaid, a gossip of Mrs.
      Crickledon’s, the subsequently famous “Little Jane.”
     </p>
<p>
      Now, Annette had shyly intimated to her father the nature of Herbert
      Fellingham’s letter, at the same time professing a perfect readiness to
      submit to his directions; and her father’s perplexity was very great, for
      Annette had rather fervently dramatized the young man’s words at the ball
      at Helmstone, which had pleasantly tickled him, and, besides, he liked the
      young man. On the other hand, he did not at all like the prospect of
      losing his daughter; and he would have desired her to be a lady of title.
      He hinted at her right to claim a high position. Annette shrank from the
      prospect, saying, “Never let me marry one who might be ashamed of my
      father!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I shouldn’t stomach that,” said Van Diemen, more disposed in favour of
      the present suitor.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette was now in a tremor. She had a lover; he was coming. And if he did
      not come, did it matter? Not so very much, except to her pride. And if he
      did, what was she to say to him? She felt like an actress who may in a few
      minutes be called on the stage, without knowing her part. This was
      painfully unlike love, and the poor girl feared it would be her
      conscientious duty to dismiss him—most gently, of course; and
      perhaps, should he be impetuous and picturesque, relent enough to let him
      hope, and so bring about a happy postponement of the question. Her father
      had been to a neighbouring town on business with Mr. Tinman. He knocked at
      her door at midnight; and she, in dread of she knew not what—chiefly
      that the Hour of the Scene had somehow struck—stepped out to him
      trembling. He was alone. She thought herself the most childish of mortals
      in supposing that she could have been summoned at midnight to declare her
      sentiments, and hardly noticed his gloomy depression. He asked her to give
      him five minutes; then asked her for a kiss, and told her to go to bed and
      sleep. But Annette had seen that a great present affliction was on him,
      and she would not be sent to sleep. She promised to listen patiently, to
      bear anything, to be brave. “Is it bad news from home?” she said, speaking
      of the old home where she had not left her heart, and where his money was
      invested.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s this, my dear Netty,” said Van Diemen, suffering her to lead him
      into her sitting-room; “we shall have to leave the shores of England.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then we are ruined.”
     </p>
<p>
      “We’re not; the rascal can’t do that. We might be off to the Continent, or
      we might go to America; we’ve money. But we can’t stay here. I’ll not live
      at any man’s mercy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The Continent! America!” exclaimed the enthusiast for England. “Oh, papa,
      you love living in England so!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not so much as all that, my dear. You do, that I know. But I don’t see
      how it’s to be managed. Mart Tinman and I have been at tooth and claw
      to-day and half the night; and he has thrown off the mask, or he’s dashed
      something from my sight, I don’t know which. I knocked him down.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Papa!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I picked him up.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh,” cried Annette, “has Mr. Tinman been hurt?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He called me a Deserter!”
     </p>
<p>
      Anisette shuddered.
    </p>
<p>
      She did not know what this thing was, but the name of it opened a cabinet
      of horrors, and she touched her father timidly, to assure him of her
      constant love, and a little to reassure herself of his substantial
      identity.
    </p>
<p>
      “And I am one,” Van Diemen made the confession at the pitch of his voice.
      “I am a Deserter; I’m liable to be branded on the back. And it’s in Mart
      Tinman’s power to have me marched away to-morrow morning in the sight of
      Crikswich, and all I can say for myself, as a man and a Briton, is, I did
      not desert before the enemy. That I swear I never would have done. Death,
      if death’s in front; but your poor mother was a handsome woman, my child,
      and there—I could not go on living in barracks and leaving her
      unprotected. I can’t tell a young woman the tale. A hundred pounds came on
      me for a legacy, as plump in my hands out of open heaven, and your poor
      mother and I saw our chance; we consulted, and we determined to risk it,
      and I got on board with her and you, and over the seas we went, first to
      shipwreck, ultimately to fortune.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen laughed miserably. “They noticed in the hunting-field here I
      had a soldier-like seat. A soldier-like seat it’ll be, with a brand on it.
      I sha’n’t be asked to take a soldier-like seat at any of their tables
      again. I may at Mart Tinman’s, out of pity, after I’ve undergone my
      punishment. There’s a year still to run out of the twenty of my term of
      service due. He knows it; he’s been reckoning; he has me. But the worst
      cat-o’-nine-tails for me is the disgrace. To have myself pointed at,
      ‘There goes the Deserter’ He was a private in the Carbineers, and he
      deserted.’ No one’ll say, ‘Ay, but he clung to the idea of his old
      schoolmate when abroad, and came back loving him, and trusted him, and was
      deceived.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen produced a spasmodic cough with a blow on his chest. Anisette
      was weeping.
    </p>
<p>
      “There, now go to bed,” said he. “I wish you might have known no more than
      you did of our flight when I got you on board the ship with your poor
      mother; but you’re a young woman now, and you must help me to think of
      another cut and run, and what baggage we can scrape together in a jiffy,
      for I won’t live here at Mart Tinman’s mercy.”
     </p>
<p>
      Drying her eyes to weep again, Annette said, when she could speak: “Will
      nothing quiet him? I was going to bother you with all sorts of silly
      questions, poor dear papa; but I see I can understand if I try. Will
      nothing—Is he so very angry? Can we not do something to pacify him?
      He is fond of money. He—oh, the thought of leaving England! Papa, it
      will kill you; you set your whole heart on England. We could—I could—could
      I not, do you not think?—step between you as a peacemaker. Mr.
      Tinman is always very courteous to me.”
     </p>
<p>
      At these words of Annette’s, Van Diemen burst into a short snap of savage
      laughter. “But that’s far away in the background, Mr. Mart Tinman!” he
      said. “You stick to your game, I know that; but you’ll find me flown,
      though I leave a name to stink like your common behind me. And,” he added,
      as a chill reminder, “that name the name of my benefactor. Poor old Van
      Diemen! He thought it a safe bequest to make.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It was; it is! We will stay; we will not be exiled,” said Annette. “I
      will do anything. What was the quarrel about, papa?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The fact is, my dear, I just wanted to show him—and take down his
      pride—I’m by my Australian education a shrewder hand than his old
      country. I bought the house on the beach while he was chaffering, and then
      I sold it him at a rise when the town was looking up—only to make
      him see. Then he burst up about something I said of Australia. I will have
      the common clean. Let him live at the Crouch as my tenant if he finds the
      house on the beach in danger.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Papa, I am sure,” Annette repeated—“sure I have influence with Mr.
      Tinman.”
     </p>
<p>
      “There are those lips of yours shutting tight,” said her father. “Just
      listen, and they make a big O. The donkey! He owns you’ve got influence,
      and he offers he’ll be silent if you’ll pledge your word to marry him. I’m
      not sure he didn’t say, within the year. I told him to look sharp not to
      be knocked down again. Mart Tinman for my son-in-law! That’s an upside
      down of my expectations, as good as being at the antipodes without a
      second voyage back! I let him know you were engaged.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette gazed at her father open-mouthed, as he had predicted; now with a
      little chilly dimple at one corner of the mouth, now at another—as a
      breeze curves the leaden winter lake here and there. She could not get his
      meaning into her sight, and she sought, by looking hard, to understand it
      better; much as when some solitary maiden lady, passing into her
      bedchamber in the hours of darkness, beholds—tradition telling us
      she has absolutely beheld foot of burglar under bed; and lo! she stares,
      and, cunningly to moderate her horror, doubts, yet cannot but believe that
      there is a leg, and a trunk, and a head, and two terrible arms, bearing
      pistols, to follow. Sick, she palpitates; she compresses her trepidation;
      she coughs, perchance she sings a bar or two of an aria. Glancing down
      again, thrice horrible to her is it to discover that there is no foot! For
      had it remained, it might have been imagined a harmless, empty boot. But
      the withdrawal has a deadly significance of animal life....
    </p>
<p>
      In like manner our stricken Annette perceived the object; so did she
      gradually apprehend the fact of her being asked for Tinman’s bride, and
      she could not think it credible. She half scented, she devised her plan of
      escape from another single mention of it. But on her father’s remarking,
      with a shuffle, frightened by her countenance, “Don’t listen to what I
      said, Netty. I won’t paint him blacker than he is”—then Annette was
      sure she had been proposed for by Mr. Tinman, and she fancied her father
      might have revolved it in his mind that there was this means of keeping
      Tinman silent, silent for ever, in his own interests.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was not true, when you told Mr. Tinman I was engaged, papa,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, I know that. Mart Tinman only half-kind of hinted. Come, I say!
      Where’s the unmarried man wouldn’t like to have a girl like you, Netty!
      They say he’s been rejected all round a circuit of fifteen miles; and he’s
      not bad-looking, neither—he looks fresh and fair. But I thought it
      as well to let him know he might get me at a disadvantage, but he couldn’t
      you. Now, don’t think about it, my love.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not if it is not necessary, papa,” said Annette; and employed her
      familiar sweetness in persuading him to go to bed, as though he were the
      afflicted one requiring to be petted.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
<p>
      Round under the cliffs by the sea, facing South, are warm seats in winter.
      The sun that shines there on a day of frost wraps you as in a mantle. Here
      it was that Mr. Herbert Fellingham found Annette, a chalk-block for her
      chair, and a mound of chalk-rubble defending her from the keen-tipped
      breath of the east, now and then shadowing the smooth blue water, faintly,
      like reflections of a flight of gulls.
    </p>
<p>
      Infants are said to have their ideas, and why not young ladies? Those who
      write of their perplexities in descriptions comical in their length are
      unkind to them, by making them appear the simplest of the creatures of
      fiction; and most of us, I am sure, would incline to believe in them if
      they were only some bit more lightly touched. Those troubled sentiments of
      our young lady of the comfortable classes are quite worthy of mention. Her
      poor little eye poring as little fishlike as possible upon the intricate,
      which she takes for the infinite, has its place in our history, nor should
      we any of us miss the pathos of it were it not that so large a space is
      claimed for the exposure. As it is, one has almost to fight a battle to
      persuade the world that she has downright thoughts and feelings, and
      really a superhuman delicacy is required in presenting her that she may be
      credible. Even then—so much being accomplished the thousands
      accustomed to chapters of her when she is in the situation of Annette will
      be disappointed by short sentences, just as of old the Continental eater
      of oysters would have been offended at the offer of an exchange of two
      live for two dozen dead ones. Annette was in the grand crucial position of
      English imaginative prose. I recognize it, and that to this the streamlets
      flow, thence pours the flood. But what was the plain truth? She had
      brought herself to think she ought to sacrifice herself to Tinman, and her
      evasions with Herbert, manifested in tricks of coldness alternating with
      tones of regret, ended, as they had commenced, in a mysterious
      half-sullenness. She had hardly a word to say. Let me step in again to
      observe that she had at the moment no pointed intention of marrying
      Tinman. To her mind the circumstances compelled her to embark on the idea
      of doing so, and she saw the extremity in an extreme distance, as those
      who are taking voyages may see death by drowning. Still she had embarked.
    </p>
<p>
      “At all events, I have your word for it that you don’t dislike me?” said
      Herbert.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! no,” she sighed. She liked him as emigrants the land they are
      leaving.
    </p>
<p>
      “And you have not promised your hand?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No,” she said, but sighed in thinking that if she could be induced to
      promise it, there would not be a word of leaving England.
    </p>
<p>
      “Then, as you are not engaged, and don’t hate me, I have a chance?” he
      said, in the semi-wailful interrogative of an organ making a mere windy
      conclusion.
    </p>
<p>
      Ocean sent up a tiny wave at their feet.
    </p>
<p>
      “A day like this in winter is rarer than a summer day,” Herbert resumed
      encouragingly.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette was replying, “People abuse our climate—”
     </p>
<p>
      But the thought of having to go out away from this climate in the darkness
      of exile, with her father to suffer under it worse than herself,
      overwhelmed her, and fetched the reality of her sorrow in the form of
      Tinman swimming before her soul with the velocity of a telegraph-pole to
      the window of the flying train. It was past as soon as seen, but it gave
      her a desperate sensation of speed.
    </p>
<p>
      She began to feel that this was life in earnest.
    </p>
<p>
      And Herbert should have been more resolute, fierier. She needed a strong
      will.
    </p>
<p>
      But he was not on the rapids of the masterful passion. For though going at
      a certain pace, it was by his own impulsion; and I am afraid I must, with
      many apologies, compare him to the skater—to the skater on easy,
      slippery ice, be it understood; but he could perform gyrations as he went,
      and he rather sailed along than dashed; he was careful of his figuring.
      Some lovers, right honest lovers, never get beyond this quaint
      skating-stage; and some ladies, a right goodly number in a foggy climate,
      deceived by their occasional runs ahead, take them for vessels on the very
      torrent of love. Let them take them, and let the race continue. Only we
      perceive that they are skating; they are careering over a smooth icy
      floor, and they can stop at a signal, with just half-a-yard of grating on
      the heel at the outside. Ice, and not fire nor falling water, has been
      their medium of progression.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether a man should unveil his own sex is quite another question. If we
      are detected, not solely are we done for, but our love-tales too. However,
      there is not much ground for anxiety on that head. Each member of the
      other party is blind on her own account.
    </p>
<p>
      To Annette the figuring of Herbert was graceful, but it did not catch her
      up and carry her; it hardly touched her: He spoke well enough to make her
      sorry for him, and not warmly enough to make her forget her sorrow for
      herself.
    </p>
<p>
      Herbert could obtain no explanation of the singularity of her conduct from
      Annette, and he went straight to her father, who was nearly as
      inexplicable for a time. At last he said:
    </p>
<p>
      “If you are ready to quit the country with us, you may have my consent.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why quit the country?” Herbert asked, in natural amazement.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen declined to tell him.
    </p>
<p>
      But seeing the young man look stupefied and wretched he took a turn about
      the room, and said: “I have n’t robbed,” and after more turns, “I have n’t
      murdered.” He growled in his menagerie trot within the four walls. “But
      I’m, in a man’s power. Will that satisfy you? You’ll tell me, because I’m
      rich, to snap my fingers. I can’t. I’ve got feelings. I’m in his power to
      hurt me and disgrace me. It’s the disgrace—to my disgrace I say it—I
      dread most. You’d be up to my reason if you had ever served in a regiment.
      I mean, discipline—if ever you’d known discipline—in the
      police if you like—anything—anywhere where there’s what we
      used to call spiny de cor. I mean, at school. And I’m,” said Van Diemen,
      “a rank idiot double D. dolt, and flat as a pancake, and transparent as a
      pane of glass. You see through me. Anybody could. I can’t talk of my
      botheration without betraying myself. What good am I among you sharp
      fellows in England?”
     </p>
<p>
      Language of this kind, by virtue of its unintelligibility, set Mr. Herbert
      Fellingham’s acute speculations at work. He was obliged to lean on Van
      Diemen’s assertion, that he had not robbed and had not murdered, to be
      comforted by the belief that he was not once a notorious bushranger, or a
      defaulting manager of mines, or any other thing that is naughtily
      Australian and kangarooly.
    </p>
<p>
      He sat at the dinner-table at Elba, eating like the rest of mankind, and
      looking like a starved beggarman all the while.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette, in pity of his bewilderment, would have had her father take him
      into their confidence. She suggested it covertly, and next she spoke of it
      to him as a prudent measure, seeing that Mr. Fellingham might find out his
      exact degree of liability. Van Diemen shouted; he betrayed himself in his
      weakness as she could not have imagined him. He was ready to go, he said—go
      on the spot, give up Elba, fly from Old England: what he could not do was
      to let his countrymen know what he was, and live among them afterwards. He
      declared that the fact had eternally been present to his mind, devouring
      him; and Annette remembered his kindness to the artillerymen posted along
      the shore westward of Crikswich, though she could recall no sign of
      remorse. Van Diemen said: “We have to do with Martin Tinman; that’s one
      who has a hold on me, and one’s enough. Leak out my secret to a second
      fellow, you double my risks.” He would not be taught to see how the second
      might counteract the first. The singularity of the action of his character
      on her position was, that though she knew not a soul to whom she could
      unburden her wretchedness, and stood far more isolated than in her
      Australian home, fever and chill struck her blood in contemplation of the
      necessity of quitting England.
    </p>
<p>
      Deep, then, was her gratitude to dear good Mrs. Cavely for stepping in to
      mediate between her father and Mr. Tinman. And well might she be amazed to
      hear the origin of their recent dispute.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was,” Mrs. Cavely said, “that Gippsland.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette cried: “What?”
     </p>
<p>
      “That Gippsland of yours, my dear. Your father will praise Gippsland
      whenever my Martin asks him to admire the beauties of our neighbourhood.
      Many a time has Martin come home to me complaining of it. We have no doubt
      on earth that Gippsland is a very fine place; but my brother has his
      idea’s of dignity, you must know, and I only wish he had been more used to
      contradiction, you may believe me. He is a lamb by nature. And, as he
      says, ‘Why underrate one’s own country?’ He cannot bear to hear boasting.
      Well! I put it to you, dear Annette, is he so unimportant a person? He
      asks to be respected, and especially by his dearest friend. From that to
      blows! It’s the way with men. They begin about trifles, they drink, they
      quarrel, and one does what he is sorry for, and one says more than he
      means. All my Martin desires is to shake your dear father’s hand, forgive
      and forget. To win your esteem, darling Annette, he would humble himself
      in the dust. Will you not help me to bring these two dear old friends
      together once more? It is unreasonable of your dear papa to go on boasting
      of Gippsland if he is so fond of England, now is it not? My brother is the
      offended party in the eye of the law. That is quite certain. Do you
      suppose he dreams of taking advantage of it? He is waiting at home to be
      told he may call on your father. Rank, dignity, wounded feelings, is
      nothing to him in comparison with friendship.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette thought of the blow which had felled him, and spoke the truth of
      her heart in saying, “He is very generous.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You understand him.” Mrs. Cavely pressed her hand. “We will both go to
      your dear father. He may,” she added, not without a gleam of feminine
      archness, “praise Gippsland above the Himalayas to me. What my Martin so
      much objected to was, the speaking of Gippsland at all when there was
      mention of our Lake scenery. As for me, I know how men love to boast of
      things nobody else has seen.”
     </p>
<p>
      The two ladies went in company to Van Diemen, who allowed himself to be
      melted. He was reserved nevertheless. His reception of Mr. Tinman
      displeased his daughter. Annette attached the blackest importance to a
      blow of the fist. In her mind it blazed fiendlike, and the man who forgave
      it rose a step or two on the sublime. Especially did he do so considering
      that he had it in his power to dismiss her father and herself from bright
      beaming England before she had looked on all the cathedrals and churches,
      the sea-shores and spots named in printed poetry, to say nothing of the
      nobility.
    </p>
<p>
      “Papa, you were not so kind to Mr. Tinman as I could have hoped,” said
      Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mart Tinman has me at his mercy, and he’ll make me know it,” her father
      returned gloomily. “He may let me off with the Commander-in-chief. He’ll
      blast my reputation some day, though. I shall be hanging my head in
      society, through him.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen imitated the disconsolate appearance of a gallows body, in one
      of those rapid flashes of spontaneous veri-similitude which spring of an
      inborn horror painting itself on the outside.
    </p>
<p>
      “A Deserter!” he moaned.
    </p>
<p>
      He succeeded in impressing the terrible nature of the stigma upon
      Annette’s imagination.
    </p>
<p>
      The guest at Elba was busy in adding up the sum of his own impressions,
      and dividing it by this and that new circumstance; for he was totally in
      the dark. He was attracted by the mysterious interview of Mrs. Cavely and
      Annette. Tinman’s calling and departing set him upon new calculations.
      Annette grew cold and visibly distressed by her consciousness of it.
    </p>
<p>
      She endeavoured to account for this variation of mood. “We have been
      invited to dine at the house on the beach to-morrow. I would not have
      accepted, but papa... we seemed to think it a duty. Of course the
      invitation extends to you. We fancy you do not greatly enjoy dining there.
      The table will be laid for you here, if you prefer.”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert preferred to try the skill of Mrs. Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, for positive penetration the head prepossessed by a suspicion is
      unmatched; for where there is no daylight; this one at least goes about
      with a lantern. Herbert begged Mrs. Crickledon to cook a dinner for him,
      and then to give the right colour to his absence from the table of Mr.
      Tinman, he started for a winter day’s walk over the downs as sharpening a
      business as any young fellow, blunt or keen, may undertake; excellent for
      men of the pen, whether they be creative, and produce, or slaughtering,
      and review; good, then, for the silly sheep of letters and the butchers.
      He sat down to Mrs. Crickledon’s table at half-past six. She was, as she
      had previously informed him, a forty-pound-a-year cook at the period of
      her courting by Crickledon. That zealous and devoted husband had made his
      first excursion inland to drop over the downs to the great house, and
      fetch her away as his bride, on the death of her master, Sir Alfred
      Pooney, who never would have parted with her in life; and every day of
      that man’s life he dirtied thirteen plates at dinner, nor more, nor less,
      but exactly that number, as if he believed there was luck in it. And as
      Crickledon said, it was odd. But it was always a pleasure to cook for him.
      Mrs. Crickledon could not abide cooking for a mean eater. And when
      Crickledon said he had never seen an acorn, he might have seen one had he
      looked about him in the great park, under the oaks, on the day when he
      came to be married.
    </p>
<p>
      “Then it’s a standing compliment to you, Mrs. Crickledon, that he did
      not,” said Herbert.
    </p>
<p>
      He remarked with the sententiousness of enforced philosophy, that no wine
      was better than bad wine.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Crickledon spoke of a bottle left by her summer lodgers, who had
      indeed left two, calling the wine invalid’s wine; and she and her husband
      had opened one on the anniversary of their marriage day in October. It had
      the taste of doctor’s shop, they both agreed; and as no friend of theirs
      could be tempted beyond a sip, they were advised, because it was called a
      tonic, to mix it with the pig-wash, so that it should not be entirely
      lost, but benefit the constitution of the pig. Herbert sipped at the
      remaining bottle, and finding himself in the superior society of an old
      Manzanilla, refilled his glass.
    </p>
<p>
      “Nothing I knows of proves the difference between gentlefolks and poor
      persons as tastes in wine,” said Mrs. Crickledon, admiring him as she
      brought in a dish of cutlets,—with Sir Alfred Pooney’s favourite
      sauce Soubise, wherein rightly onion should be delicate as the idea of
      love in maidens’ thoughts, albeit constituting the element of flavour.
      Something of such a dictum Sir Alfred Pooney had imparted to his cook, and
      she repeated it with the fresh elegance of, such sweet sayings when
      transfused through the native mind:
    </p>
<p>
      “He said, I like as it was what you would call a young gal’s blush at a
      kiss round a corner.”
     </p>
<p>
      The epicurean baronet had the habit of talking in that way.
    </p>
<p>
      Herbert drank to his memory. He was well-filled; he had no work to do, and
      he was exuberant in spirits, as Mrs. Crickledon knew her countrymen should
      and would be under those conditions. And suddenly he drew his hand across
      a forehead so wrinkled and dark, that Mrs. Crickledon exclaimed, “Heart or
      stomach?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, no,” said he. “I’m sound enough in both, I hope.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That old Tinman’s up to one of his games,” she observed.
    </p>
<p>
      “Do you think so?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He’s circumventing Miss Annette Smith.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pooh! Crickledon. A man of his age can’t be seriously thinking of
      proposing for a young lady.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He’s a well-kept man. He’s never racketed. He had n’t the rackets in him.
      And she may n’t care for him. But we hear things drop.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What things have you heard drop, Crickledon? In a profound silence you
      may hear pins; in a hubbub you may hear cannon-balls. But I never believe
      in eavesdropping gossip.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He was heard to say to Mr. Smith,” Crickledon pursued, and she lowered
      her voice, “he was heard to say, it was when they were quarreling over
      that chiwal, and they went at one another pretty hard before Mr. Smith
      beat him and he sold Mr. Smith that meadow; he was heard to say, there was
      worse than transportation for Mr. Smith if he but lifted his finger. They
      Tinmans have awful tempers. His old mother died malignant, though she was
      a saving woman, and never owed a penny to a Christian a hour longer than
      it took to pay the money. And old Tinman’s just such another.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Transportation!” Herbert ejaculated, “that’s sheer nonsense, Crickledon.
      I’m sure your husband would tell you so.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It was my husband brought me the words,” Mrs. Crickledon rejoined with
      some triumph. “He did tell me, I own, to keep it shut: but my speaking to
      you, a friend of Mr. Smith’s, won’t do no harm. He heard them under the
      battery, over that chiwal glass: ‘And you shall pay,’ says Mr. Smith, and
      ‘I sha’n’t,’ says old Tinman. Mr. Smith said he would have it if he had to
      squeeze a deathbed confession from a sinner. Then old Tinman fires out,
      ‘You!’ he says, ‘you’ and he stammered. ‘Mr. Smith,’ my husband said and
      you never saw a man so shocked as my husband at being obliged to hear them
      at one another Mr. Smith used the word damn. ‘You may laugh, sir.’”
     </p>
<p>
      “You say it so capitally, Crickledon.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And then old Tinman said, ‘And a D. to you; and if I lift my finger, it’s
      Big D. on your back.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And what did Mr. Smith say, then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He said, like a man shot, my husband says he said, ‘My God!’”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert Fellingham jumped away from the table.
    </p>
<p>
      “You tell me, Crickledon, your husband actually heard that—just
      those words?—the tones?”
     </p>
<p>
      “My husband says he heard him say, ‘My God!’ just like a poor man shot or
      stabbed. You may speak to Crickledon, if you speaks to him alone, sir. I
      say you ought to know. For I’ve noticed Mr. Smith since that day has never
      looked to me the same easy-minded happy gentleman he was when we first
      knew him. He would have had me go to cook for him at Elba, but Crickledon
      thought I’d better be independent, and Mr. Smith said to me, ‘Perhaps
      you’re right, Crickledon, for who knows how long I may be among you?’”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert took the solace of tobacco in Crickledon’s shop. Thence, with the
      story confirmed to him, he sauntered toward the house on the beach.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
<p>
      The moon was over sea. Coasting vessels that had run into the bay for
      shelter from the North wind lay with their shadows thrown shoreward on the
      cold smooth water, almost to the verge of the beach, where there was
      neither breath nor sound of wind, only the lisp at the pebbles.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Crickledon’s dinner and the state of his heart made young Fellingham
      indifferent to a wintry atmosphere. It sufficed him that the night was
      fair. He stretched himself on the shingle, thinking of the Manzanilla, and
      Annette, and the fine flavour given to tobacco by a dry still air in
      moonlight—thinking of his work, too, in the background, as far as
      mental lassitude would allow of it. The idea of taking Annette to see his
      first play at the theatre when it should be performed—was very
      soothing. The beach rather looked like a stage, and the sea like a ghostly
      audience, with, if you will, the broadside bulks of black sailing craft at
      anchor for representatives of the newspaper piers. Annette was a nice
      girl; if a little commonplace and low-born, yet sweet. What a subject he
      could make of her father! “The Deserter” offered a new complication.
      Fellingham rapidly sketched it in fancy—Van Diemen, as a Member of
      the Parliament of Great Britain, led away from the House of Commons to be
      branded on the bank! What a magnificent fall! We have so few intensely
      dramatic positions in English real life that the meditative author grew
      enamoured of this one, and laughed out a royal “Ha!” like a monarch
      reviewing his well-appointed soldiery.
    </p>
<p>
      “There you are,” said Van Diemen’s voice; “I smelt your pipe. You’re a rum
      fellow, to belying out on the beach on a cold night. Lord! I don’t like
      you the worse for it. Twas for the romance of the moon in my young days.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Where is Annette?” said Fellingham, jumping to his feet.
    </p>
<p>
      “My daughter? She ‘s taking leave of her intended.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What’s that?” Fellingham gasped. “Good heavens, Mr. Smith, what do you
      mean?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pick up your pipe, my lad. Girls choose as they please, I suppose”
     </p>
<p>
      “Her intended, did you say, sir? What can that mean?”
     </p>
<p>
      “My dear good young fellow, don’t make a fuss. We’re all going to stay
      here, and very glad to see you from time to time. The fact is, I oughtn’t
      to have quarrelled with Mart Tinman as I’ve done; I’m too peppery by
      nature. The fact is, I struck him, and he forgave it. I could n’t have
      done that myself. And I believe I’m in for a headache to-morrow; upon my
      soul, I do. Mart Tinman would champagne us; but, poor old boy, I struck
      him, and I couldn’t make amends—didn’t see my way; and we joined
      hands over the glass—to the deuce with the glass!—and the end
      of it is, Netty—she did n’t propose it, but as I’m in his—I
      say, as I had struck him, she—it was rather solemn, if you had seen
      us—she burst into tears, and there was Mrs. Cavely, and old Mart,
      and me as big a fool—if I’m not a villain!”
     </p>
<p>
      Fellingham perceived a more than common effect of Tin man’s wine. He
      touched Van Diemen on the shoulder. “May I beg to hear exactly what has
      happened?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Upon my soul, we’re all going to live comfortably in Old England, and no
      more quarreling and decamping,” was the stupid rejoinder. “Except that I
      did n’t exactly—I think you said I exactly’?—I did n’t bargain
      for old Mart as my—but he’s a sound man; Mart’s my junior; he’s
      rich. He’s eco ... he’s eco... you know—my Lord! where’s my brains?—but
      he’s upright—‘nomical!”
     </p>
<p>
      “An economical man,” said Fellingham, with sedate impatience.
    </p>
<p>
      “My dear sir, I’m heartily obliged to you for your assistance,” returned
      Van Diemen. “Here she is.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette had come out of the gate in the flint wall. She started slightly
      on seeing Herbert, whom she had taken for a coastguard, she said. He
      bowed. He kept his head bent, peering at her intrusively.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s the air on champagne,” Van Diemen said, calling on his lungs to
      clear themselves and right him. “I was n’t a bit queer in the house.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The air on Tinman’s champagne!” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “It must be like the contact of two hostile chemical elements.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette walked faster.
    </p>
<p>
      They descended from the shingle to the scant-bladed grass-sweep running
      round the salted town-refuse on toward Elba. Van Diemen sniffed,
      ejaculating, “I’ll be best man with Mart Tinman about this business!
      You’ll stop with us, Mr.——what’s your Christian name? Stop
      with us as long as you like. Old friends for me! The joke of it is that
      Nelson was my man, and yet I went and enlisted in the cavalry. If you talk
      of chemical substances, old Mart Tinman was a sneak who never cared a dump
      for his country; and I’m not to speak a single sybbarel about that.....
      over there... Australia... Gippsland! So down he went, clean over. Very
      sorry for what we have done. Contrite. Penitent.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Now we feel the wind a little,” said Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      Fellingham murmured, “Allow me; your shawl is flying loose.”
     </p>
<p>
      He laid his hands on her arms, and, pressing her in a tremble, said, “One
      sign! It’s not true? A word! Do you hate me?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thank you very much, but I am not cold,” she replied and linked herself
      to her father.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen immediately shouted, “For we are jolly boys! for we are jolly
      boys! It’s the air on the champagne. And hang me,” said he, as they
      entered the grounds of Elba, “if I don’t walk over my property.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette interposed; she stood like a reed in his way.
    </p>
<p>
      “No! my Lord! I’ll see what I sold you for!” he cried. “I’m an owner of
      the soil of Old England, and care no more for the title of squire than
      Napoleon Bonaparty. But I’ll tell you what, Mr. Hubbard: your mother was
      never so astonished at her dog as old Van Diemen would be to hear himself
      called squire in Old England. And a convict he was, for he did wrong once,
      but he worked his redemption. And the smell of my own property makes me
      feel my legs again. And I’ll tell you what, Mr. Hubbard, as Netty calls
      you when she speaks of you in private: Mart Tinman’s ideas of wine are
      pretty much like his ideas of healthy smells, and when I’m bailiff of
      Crikswich, mind, he’ll find two to one against him in our town council. I
      love my country, but hang me if I don’t purify it—”
     </p>
<p>
      Saying this, with the excitement of a high resolve a upon him, Van Diemen
      bored through a shrubbery-brake, and Fellingham said to Annette:
    </p>
<p>
      “Have I lost you?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I belong to my father,” said she, contracting and disengaging her
      feminine garments to step after him in the cold silver-spotted dusk of the
      winter woods.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen came out on a fish-pond.
    </p>
<p>
      “Here you are, young ones!” he said to the pair. “This way, Fellowman. I’m
      clearer now, and it’s my belief I’ve been talking nonsense. I’m puffed up
      with money, and have n’t the heart I once had. I say, Fellowman,
      Fellowbird, Hubbard—what’s your right name?—fancy an old carp
      fished out of that pond and flung into the sea. That’s exile! And if the
      girl don’t mind, what does it matter?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Herbert Fellingham, I think, would like to go to bed, papa,” said
      Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “Miss Smith must be getting cold,” Fellingham hinted.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bounce away indoors,” replied Van Diemen, and he led them like a bull.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette was disinclined to leave them together in the smoking-room, and
      under the pretext of wishing to see her father to bed she remained with
      them, though there was a novel directness and heat of tone in Herbert that
      alarmed her, and with reason. He divined in hideous outlines what had
      happened. He was no longer figuring on easy ice, but desperate at the
      prospect of a loss to himself, and a fate for Annette, that tossed him
      from repulsion to incredulity, and so back.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen begged him to light his pipe.
    </p>
<p>
      “I’m off to London to-morrow,” said Fellingham. “I don’t want to go, for
      very particular reasons; I may be of more use there. I have a cousin who’s
      a General officer in the army, and if I have your permission—you
      see, anything’s better, as it seems to me, than that you should depend for
      peace and comfort on one man’s tongue not wagging, especially when he is
      not the best of tempers if I have your permission—without mentioning
      names, of course—I’ll consult him.”
     </p>
<p>
      There was a dead silence.
    </p>
<p>
      “You know you may trust me, sir. I love your daughter with all my heart.
      Your honour and your interests are mine.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen struggled for composure.
    </p>
<p>
      “Netty, what have you been at?” he said.
    </p>
<p>
      “It is untrue, papa!” she answered the unworded accusation.
    </p>
<p>
      “Annette has told me nothing, sir. I have heard it. You must brace your
      mind to the fact that it is known. What is known to Mr. Tinman is pretty
      sure to be known generally at the next disagreement.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That scoundrel Mart!” Van Diemen muttered.
    </p>
<p>
      “I am positive Mr. Tinman did not speak of you, papa,” said Annette, and
      turned her eyes from the half-paralyzed figure of her father on Herbert to
      put him to proof.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, but he made himself heard when it was being discussed. At any rate,
      it’s known; and the thing to do is to meet it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I’m off. I’ll not stop a day. I’d rather live on the Continent,” said Van
      Diemen, shaking himself, as to prepare for the step into that desert.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Tinman has been most generous!” Annette protested tearfully.
    </p>
<p>
      “I won’t say no: I think you are deceived and lend him your own
      generosity,” said Herbert. “Can you suppose it generous, that even in the
      extremest case, he should speak of the matter to your father, and talk of
      denouncing him? He did it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He was provoked.”
     </p>
<p>
      “A gentleman is distinguished by his not allowing himself to be provoked.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am engaged to him, and I cannot hear it said that he is not a
      gentleman.”
     </p>
<p>
      The first part of her sentence Annette uttered bravely; at the conclusion
      she broke down. She wished Herbert to be aware of the truth, that he might
      stay his attacks on Mr. Tinman; and she believed he had only been guessing
      the circumstances in which her father was placed; but the comparison
      between her two suitors forced itself on her now, when the younger one
      spoke in a manner so self-contained, brief, and full of feeling.
    </p>
<p>
      She had to leave the room weeping.
    </p>
<p>
      “Has your daughter engaged herself, sir?” said Herbert.
    </p>
<p>
      “Talk to me to-morrow; don’t give us up if she has we were trapped, it’s
      my opinion,” said Van Diemen. “There’s the devil in that wine of—Mart
      Tinman’s. I feel it still, and in the morning it’ll be worse. What can she
      see in him? I must quit the country; carry her off. How he did it, I don’t
      know. It was that woman, the widow, the fellow’s sister. She talked till
      she piped her eye—talked about our lasting union. On my soul, I
      believe I egged Netty on! I was in a mollified way with that wine; all of
      a sudden the woman joins their hands! And I—a man of spirit will
      despise me!—what I thought of was, ‘now my secret’s safe!’ You’ve
      sobered me, young sir. I see myself, if that’s being sober. I don’t ask
      your opinion of me; I am a deserter, false to my colours, a breaker of his
      oath. Only mark this: I was married, and a common trooper, married to a
      handsome young woman, true as steel; but she was handsome, and we were
      starvation poor, and she had to endure persecution from an officer day by
      day. Bear that situation in your mind.... Providence dropped me a hundred
      pounds out of the sky. Properly speaking, it popped up out of the earth,
      for I reaped it, you may say, from a relative’s grave. Rich and poor ‘s
      all right, if I’m rich and you’re poor; and you may be happy though you’re
      poor; but where there are many poor young women, lots of rich men are a
      terrible temptation to them. That’s my dear good wife speaking, and had
      she been spared to me I never should have come back to Old England, and
      heart’s delight and heartache I should not have known. She was my
      backbone, she was my breast-comforter too. Why did she stick to me?
      Because I had faith in her when appearances were against her. But she
      never forgave this country the hurt to her woman’s pride. You’ll have
      noticed a squarish jaw in Netty. That’s her mother. And I shall have to
      encounter it, supposing I find Mart Tinman has been playing me false. I’m
      blown on somehow. I’ll think of what course I’ll take ‘twixt now and
      morning. Good night, young gentleman.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good night; sir,” said Herbert, adding, “I will get information from the
      Horse Guards; as for the people knowing it about here, you’re not living
      much in society—”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s not other people’s feelings, it’s my own,” Van Diemen silenced him.
      “I feel it, if it’s in the wind; ever since Mart Tinman spoke the thing
      out, I’ve felt on my skin cold and hot.”
     </p>
<p>
      He flourished his lighted candle and went to bed, manifestly solaced by
      the idea that he was the victim of his own feelings.
    </p>
<p>
      Herbert could not sleep. Annette’s monstrous choice of Tinman in
      preference to himself constantly assailed and shook his understanding.
      There was the “squarish jaw” mentioned by her father to think of. It
      filled him with a vague apprehension, but he was unable to imagine that a
      young girl, and an English girl, and an enthusiastic young English girl,
      could be devoid of sentiment; and presuming her to have it, as one must,
      there was no fear, that she would persist in her loathsome choice when she
      knew her father was against it.

<h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
<p>
      Annette did not shun him next morning. She did not shun the subject,
      either. But she had been exact in arranging that she should not be more
      than a few minutes downstairs before her father. Herbert found, that
      compared with her, girls of sentiment are commonplace indeed. She had
      conceived an insane idea of nobility in Tinman that blinded her to his
      face, figure, and character—his manners, likewise. He had forgiven a
      blow!
    </p>
<p>
      Silly as the delusion might be, it clothed her in whimsical
      attractiveness.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a beauty in her to dwell so firmly upon moral quality. Overthrown
      and stunned as he was, and reduced to helplessness by her brief and
      positive replies, Herbert was obliged to admire the singular young lady,
      who spoke, without much shyness, of her incongruous, destined mate though
      his admiration had an edge cutting like irony. While in the turn for
      candour, she ought to have told him, that previous to her decision she had
      weighed the case of the diverse claims of himself and Tinman, and resolved
      them according to her predilection for the peaceful residence of her
      father and herself in England. This she had done a little regretfully,
      because of the natural sympathy of the young girl for the younger man. But
      the younger man had seemed to her seriously-straightforward mind too light
      and airy in his wooing, like one of her waltzing officers—very well
      so long as she stepped the measure with him, and not forcible enough to
      take her off her feet. He had changed, and now that he had become
      persuasive, she feared he would disturb the serenity with which she
      desired and strove to contemplate her decision. Tinman’s magnanimity was
      present in her imagination to sustain her, though she was aware that Mrs.
      Cavely had surprised her will, and caused it to surrender unconsulted by
      her wiser intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      “I cannot listen to you,” she said to Herbert, after listening longer than
      was prudent. “If what you say of papa is true, I do not think he will
      remain in Crikswich, or even in England. But I am sure the old friend we
      used, to speak of so much in Australia has not wilfully betrayed him.”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert would have had to say, “Look on us two!” to proceed in his baffled
      wooing; and the very ludicrousness of the contrast led him to see the
      folly and shame of proposing it.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen came down to breakfast looking haggard and restless. “I have
      ‘nt had my morning’s walk—I can’t go out to be hooted,” he said,
      calling to his daughter for tea, and strong tea; and explaining to Herbert
      that he knew it to be bad for the nerves, but it was an antidote to bad
      champagne.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Herbert Fellingham had previously received an invitation on behalf of
      a sister of his to Crikswich. A dull sense of genuine sagacity inspired
      him to remind Annette of it. She wrote prettily to Miss Mary Fellingham,
      and Herbert had some faint joy in carrying away the letter of her
      handwriting.
    </p>
<p>
      “Fetch her soon, for we sha’n’t be here long,” Van Diemen said to him at
      parting. He expressed a certain dread of his next meeting with Mart
      Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      Herbert speedily brought Mary Fellingham to Elba, and left her there. The
      situation was apparently unaltered. Van Diemen looked worn, like a man who
      has been feeding mainly on his reflections, which was manifest in his few
      melancholy bits of speech. He said to Herbert: “How you feel a thing when
      you are found out!” and, “It doesn’t do for a man with a heart to do
      wrong!” He designated the two principal roads by which poor sinners come
      to a conscience. His own would have slumbered but for discovery; and, as
      he remarked, if it had not been for his heart leading him to Tinman, he
      would not have fallen into that man’s power.
    </p>
<p>
      The arrival of a young lady of fashionable appearance at Elba was matter
      of cogitation to Mrs. Cavely. She was disposed to suspect that it meant
      something, and Van Diemen’s behaviour to her brother would of itself have
      fortified any suspicion. He did not call at the house on the beach, he did
      not invite Martin to dinner, he was rarely seen, and when he appeared at
      the Town Council he once or twice violently opposed his friend Martin, who
      came home ruffled, deeply offended in his interests and his dignity.
    </p>
<p>
      “Have you noticed any difference in Annette’s treatment of you, dear?”
       Mrs. Cavely inquired.
    </p>
<p>
      “No,” said Tinman; “none. She shakes hands. She asks after my health. She
      offers me my cup of tea.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I have seen all that. But does she avoid privacy with you?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Dear me, no! Why should she? I hope, Martha, I am a man who may be
      confided in by any young lady in England.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am sure you may, dear Martin.”
     </p>
<p>
      “She has an objection to name the... the day,” said Martin. “I have
      informed her that I have an objection to long engagements. I don’t like
      her new companion: She says she has been presented at Court. I greatly
      doubt it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s to give herself a style, you may depend. I don’t believe her!”
       exclaimed Mrs. Cavely, with sharp personal asperity.
    </p>
<p>
      Brother and sister examined together the Court Guide they had purchased on
      the occasion at once of their largest outlay and most thrilling
      gratification; in it they certainly found the name of General Fellingham.
      “But he can’t be related to a newspaper-writer,” said Mrs. Cavely.
    </p>
<p>
      To which her brother rejoined, “Unless the young man turned scamp. I hate
      unproductive professions.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I hate him, Martin.” Mrs. Cavely laughed in scorn, “I should say, I pity
      him. It’s as clear to me as the sun at noonday, he wanted Annette. That’s
      why I was in a hurry. How I dreaded he would come that evening to our
      dinner! When I saw him absent, I could have cried out it was Providence!
      And so be careful—we have had everything done for us from on High as
      yet—but be careful of your temper, dear Martin. I will hasten on the
      union; for it’s a shame of a girl to drag a man behind her till he ‘s old
      at the altar. Temper, dear, if you will only think of it, is the weak
      point.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Now he has begun boasting to me of his Australian wines!” Tinman
      ejaculated.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bear it. Bear it as you do Gippsland. My dear, you have the retort in
      your heart:—Yes! but have you a Court in Australia?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ha! and his Australian wines cost twice the amount I pay for mine!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Quite true. We are not obliged to buy them, I should hope. I would,
      though—a dozen—if I thought it necessary, to keep him quiet.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman continued muttering angrily over the Australian wines, with a word
      of irritation at Gippsland, while promising to be watchful of his temper.
    </p>
<p>
      “What good is Australia to us,” he asked, “if it does n’t bring us money?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s going to, my dear,” said Mrs. Cavely. “Think of that when he begins
      boasting his Australia. And though it’s convict’s money, as he confesses—”
     </p>
<p>
      “With his convict’s money!” Tinman interjected tremblingly. “How long am I
      expected to wait?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Rely on me to hurry on the day,” said Mrs. Cavely. “There is no other
      annoyance?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Wherever I am going to buy, that man outbids me and then says it’s the
      old country’s want of pluck and dash, and doing things large-handed! A man
      who’d go on his knees to stop in England!” Tinman vociferated in a breath;
      and fairly reddened by the effort: “He may have to do it yet. I can’t
      stand insult.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You are less able to stand insult after Honours,” his sister said, in
      obedience to what she had observed of him since his famous visit to
      London. “It must be so, in nature. But temper is everything just now.
      Remember, it was by command of temper, and letting her father put himself
      in the wrong, you got hold of Annette. And I would abstain even from wine.
      For sometimes after it, you have owned it disagreed. And I have noticed
      these eruptions between you and Mr. Smith—as he calls himself—generally
      after wine.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Always the poor! the poor! money for the poor!” Tinman harped on further
      grievances against Van Diemen. “I say doctors have said the drain on the
      common is healthy; it’s a healthy smell, nourishing. We’ve always had it
      and been a healthy town. But the sea encroaches, and I say my house and my
      property is in danger. He buys my house over my head, and offers me the
      Crouch to live in at an advanced rent. And then he sells me my house at an
      advanced price, and I buy, and then he votes against a penny for the
      protection of the shore! And we’re in Winter again! As if he was not in my
      power!”
     </p>
<p>
      “My dear Martin, to Elba we go, and soon, if you will govern your temper,”
       said Mrs. Cavely. “You’re an angel to let me speak of it so, and it’s only
      that man that irritates you. I call him sinfully ostentatious.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I could blow him from a gun if I spoke out, and he knows it! He’s wanting
      in common gratitude, let alone respect,” Tinman snorted.
    </p>
<p>
      “But he has a daughter, my dear.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman slowly and crackingly subsided.
    </p>
<p>
      His main grievance against Van Diemen was the non-recognition of his
      importance by that uncultured Australian, who did not seem to be conscious
      of the dignities and distinctions we come to in our country. The moneyed
      daughter, the prospective marriage, for an economical man rejected by
      every lady surrounding him, advised him to lock up his temper in
      submission to Martha.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bring Annette to dine with us,” he said, on Martha’s proposing a visit to
      the dear young creature.
    </p>
<p>
      Martha drank a glass of her brother’s wine at lunch, and departed on the
      mission.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette declined to be brought. Her excuse was her guest, Miss Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bring her too, by all means—if you’ll condescend, I am sure,” Mrs.
      Cavely said to Mary.
    </p>
<p>
      “I am much obliged to you; I do not dine out at present,” said the London
      lady.
    </p>
<p>
      “Dear me! are you ill?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nothing in the family, I hope?”
     </p>
<p>
      “My family?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am sure, I beg pardon,” said Mrs. Cavely, bridling with a spite
      pardonable by the severest moralist.
    </p>
<p>
      “Can I speak to you alone?” she addressed Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Fellingham rose.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Cavely confronted her. “I can’t allow it; I can’t think of it. I’m
      only taking a little liberty with one I may call my future sister-in-law.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Shall I come out with you?” said Annette, in sheer lassitude assisting
      Mary Fellingham in her scheme to show the distastefulness of this lady and
      her brother.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not if you don’t wish to.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I have no objection.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Another time will do.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Will you write?”
     </p>
<p>
      “By post indeed!”
     </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Cavely delivered a laugh supposed to, be peculiar to the English
      stage.
    </p>
<p>
      “It would be a penny thrown away,” said Annette. “I thought you could send
      a messenger.”
     </p>
<p>
      Intercommunication with Miss Fellingham had done mischief to her high
      moral conception of the pair inhabiting the house on the beach. Mrs.
      Cavely saw it, and could not conceal that she smarted.
    </p>
<p>
      Her counsel to her brother, after recounting the offensive scene to him in
      animated dialogue, was, to give Van Diemen a fright.
    </p>
<p>
      “I wish I had not drunk that glass of sherry before starting,” she
      exclaimed, both savagely and sagely. “It’s best after business. And these
      gentlemen’s habits of yours of taking to dining late upset me. I’m afraid
      I showed temper; but you, Martin, would not have borne one-tenth of what I
      did.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How dare you say so!” her brother rebuked her indignantly; and the house
      on the beach enclosed with difficulty a storm between brother and sister,
      happily not heard outside, because of loud winds raging.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless Tinman pondered on Martha’s idea of the wisdom of giving Van
      Diemen a fright.

<h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
<p>
      The English have been called a bad-tempered people, but this is to judge
      of them by their manifestations; whereas an examination into causes might
      prove them to be no worse tempered than that man is a bad sleeper who lies
      in a biting bed. If a sagacious instinct directs them to discountenance
      realistic tales, the realistic tale should justify its appearance by the
      discovery of an apology for the tormented souls. Once they sang madrigals,
      once they danced on the green, they revelled in their lusty humours,
      without having recourse to the pun for fun, an exhibition of hundreds of
      bare legs for jollity, a sentimental wailing all in the throat for music.
      Evidence is procurable that they have been an artificially-reared people,
      feeding on the genius of inventors, transposers, adulterators, instead of
      the products of nature, for the last half century; and it is unfair to
      affirm of them that they are positively this or that. They are
      experiments. They are the sons and victims of a desperate Energy, alluring
      by cheapness, satiating with quantity, that it may mount in the social
      scale, at the expense of their tissues. The land is in a state of
      fermentation to mount, and the shop, which has shot half their stars to
      their social zenith, is what verily they would scald themselves to wash
      themselves free of. Nor is it in any degree a reprehensible sign that they
      should fly as from hue and cry the title of tradesman. It is on the
      contrary the spot of sanity, which bids us right cordially hope. Energy,
      transferred to the moral sense, may clear them yet.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile this beer, this wine, both are of a character to have killed
      more than the tempers of a less gifted people. Martin Tinman invited Van
      Diemen Smith to try the flavour of a wine that, as he said, he thought of
      “laying down.”
     </p>
<p>
      It has been hinted before of a strange effect upon the minds of men who
      knew what they were going to, when they received an invitation to dine
      with Tinman. For the sake of a little social meeting at any cost, they
      accepted it; accepted it with a sigh, midway as by engineering measurement
      between prospective and retrospective; as nearly mechanical as things
      human may be, like the Mussulman’s accustomed cry of Kismet. Has it not
      been related of the little Jew babe sucking at its mother’s breast in
      Jerusalem, that this innocent, long after the Captivity, would start
      convulsively, relinquishing its feast, and indulging in the purest. Hebrew
      lamentation of the most tenacious of races, at the passing sound of a
      Babylonian or a Ninevite voice? In some such manner did men, unable to
      refuse, deep in what remained to them of nature, listen to Tinman; and so
      did Van Diemen, sighing heavily under the operation of simple animal
      instinct.
    </p>
<p>
      “You seem miserable,” said Tinman, not oblivious of his design to give his
      friend a fright.
    </p>
<p>
      “Do I? No, I’m all right,” Van Diemen replied. “I’m thinking of
      alterations at the Hall before Summer, to accommodate guests—if I
      stay here.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I suppose you would not like to be separated from Annette.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Separated? No, I should think I shouldn’t. Who’d do it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Because I should not like to leave my good sister Martha all to herself
      in a house so near the sea—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why not go to the Crouch, man?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thank you.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No thanks needed if you don’t take advantage of the offer.”
     </p>
<p>
      They were at the entrance to Elba, whither Mr. Tinman was betaking himself
      to see his intended. He asked if Annette was at home, and to his great
      stupefaction heard that she had gone to London for a week.
    </p>
<p>
      Dissembling the spite aroused within him, he postponed his very strongly
      fortified design, and said, “You must be lonely.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen informed him that it would be for a night only, as young
      Fellingham was coming down to keep him company.
    </p>
<p>
      “At six o’clock this evening, then,” said Tinman. “We’re not fashionable
      in Winter.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hang me, if I know when ever we were!” Van Diemen rejoined.
    </p>
<p>
      “Come, though, you’d like to be. You’ve got your ambition, Philip, like
      other men.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Respectable and respected—that ‘s my ambition, Mr. Mart.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman simpered: “With your wealth!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ay, I ‘m rich—for a contented mind.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I ‘m pretty sure you ‘ll approve my new vintage,” said Tinman. “It’s
      direct from Oporto, my wine-merchant tells me, on his word.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What’s the price?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, no, no. Try it first. It’s rather a stiff price.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen was partially reassured by the announcement. “What do you call
      a stiff price?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well!—over thirty.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Double that, and you may have a chance.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Now,” cried Tinman, exasperated, “how can a man from Australia know
      anything about prices for port? You can’t divest your ideas of diggers’ 
      prices. You’re like an intoxicating drink yourself on the tradesmen of our
      town. You think it fine—ha! ha! I daresay, Philip, I should be doing
      the same if I were up to your mark at my banker’s. We can’t all of us be
      lords, nor baronets.”
     </p>
<p>
      Catching up his temper thus cleverly, he curbed that habitual runaway, and
      retired from his old friend’s presence to explode in the society of the
      solitary Martha.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette’s behaviour was as bitterly criticized by the sister as by the
      brother.
    </p>
<p>
      “She has gone to those Fellingham people; and she may be thinking of
      jilting us,” Mrs. Cavely said.
    </p>
<p>
      “In that case, I have no mercy,” cried her brother. “I have borne”—he
      bowed with a professional spiritual humility—“as I should, but it
      may get past endurance. I say I have borne enough; and if the worst comes
      to the worst, and I hand him over to the authorities—I say I mean
      him no harm, but he has struck me. He beat me as a boy and he has struck
      me as a man, and I say I have no thought of revenge, but I cannot have him
      here; and I say if I drive him out of the country back to his Gippsland!”
     </p>
<p>
      Martin Tinman quivered for speech, probably for that which feedeth speech,
      as is the way with angry men.
    </p>
<p>
      “And what?—what then?” said Martha, with the tender mellifluousness
      of sisterly reproach. “What good can you expect of letting temper get the
      better of you, dear?”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman did not enjoy her recent turn for usurping the lead in their
      consultations, and he said, tartly, “This good, Martha. We shall get the
      Hall at my price, and be Head People here. Which,” he raised his note,
      “which he, a Deserter, has no right to pretend to give himself out to be.
      What your feelings may be as an old inhabitant, I don’t know, but I have
      always looked up to the people at Elba Hall, and I say I don’t like to
      have a Deserter squandering convict’s money there—with his
      forty-pound-a-year cook, and his champagne at seventy a dozen. It’s the
      luxury of Sodom and Gomorrah.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That does not prevent its being very nice to dine there,” said Mrs.
      Cavely; “and it shall be our table for good if I have any management.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You mean me, ma’am,” bellowed Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not at all,” she breathed, in dulcet contrast. “You are good-looking,
      Martin, but you have not half such pretty eyes as the person I mean. I
      never ventured to dream of managing you, Martin. I am thinking of the
      people at Elba.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But why this extraordinary treatment of me, Martha?”
     </p>
<p>
      “She’s a child, having her head turned by those Fellinghams. But she’s
      honourable; she has sworn to me she would be honourable.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You do think I may as well give him a fright?” Tinman inquired hungrily.
    </p>
<p>
      “A sort of hint; but very gentle, Martin. Do be gentle—casual like—as
      if you did n’t want to say it. Get him on his Gippsland. Then if he brings
      you to words, you can always laugh back, and say you will go to Kew and
      see the Fernery, and fancy all that, so high, on Helvellyn or the Downs.
      Why”—Mrs. Cavely, at the end of her astute advices and cautionings,
      as usual, gave loose to her natural character—“Why that man came
      back to England at all, with his boastings of Gippsland, I can’t for the
      life of me find out. It ‘s a perfect mystery.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is,” Tinman sounded his voice at a great depth, reflectively. Glad of
      taking the part she was perpetually assuming of late, he put out his hand
      and said: “But it may have been ordained for our good, Martha.”
     </p>
<p>
      “True, dear,” said she, with an earnest sentiment of thankfulness to the
      Power which had led him round to her way of thinking and feeling.

<h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
<p>
      Annette had gone to the big metropolis, which burns in colonial
      imaginations as the sun of cities, and was about to see something of
      London, under the excellent auspices of her new friend, Mary Fellingham,
      and a dense fog. She was alarmed by the darkness, a little in fear, too,
      of Herbert; and these feelings caused her to chide herself for leaving her
      father.
    </p>
<p>
      Hearing her speak of her father sadly, Herbert kindly proposed to go down
      to Crikswich on the very day of her coming. She thanked him, and gave him
      a taste of bitterness by smiling favourably on his offer; but as he wished
      her to discern and take to heart the difference between one man and
      another, in the light of a suitor, he let her perceive that it cost him
      heavy pangs to depart immediately, and left her to brood on his example.
      Mary Fellingham liked Annette. She thought her a sensible girl of
      uncultivated sensibilities, the reverse of thousands; not commonplace,
      therefore; and that the sensibilities were expanding was to be seen in her
      gradual unreadiness to talk of her engagement to Mr. Tinman, though her
      intimacy with Mary warmed daily. She considered she was bound to marry the
      man at some distant date, and did not feel unhappiness yet. She had only
      felt uneasy when she had to greet and converse with her intended;
      especially when the London young lady had been present. Herbert’s
      departure relieved her of the pressing sense of contrast. She praised him
      to Mary for his extreme kindness to her father, and down in her unsounded
      heart desired that her father might appreciate it even more than she did.
    </p>
<p>
      Herbert drove into Crikswich at night, and stopped at Crickledon’s, where
      he heard that Van Diemen was dining with Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      Crickledon the carpenter permitted certain dry curves to play round his
      lips like miniature shavings at the name of Tinman; but Herbert asked,
      “What is it now?” in vain, and he went to Crickledon the cook.
    </p>
<p>
      This union of the two Crickledons, male and female; was an ideal one, such
      as poor women dream of; and men would do the same, if they knew how poor
      they are. Each had a profession, each was independent of the other, each
      supported the fabric. Consequently there was mutual respect, as between
      two pillars of a house. Each saw the other’s faults with a sly wink to the
      world, and an occasional interchange of sarcasm that was tonic, very
      strengthening to the wits without endangering the habit of affection.
      Crickledon the cook stood for her own opinions, and directed the public
      conduct of Crickledon the carpenter; and if he went astray from the line
      she marked out, she put it down to human nature, to which she was
      tolerant. He, when she had not followed his advice, ascribed it to the
      nature of women. She never said she was the equal of her husband; but the
      carpenter proudly acknowledged that she was as good as a man, and he bore
      with foibles derogatory to such high stature, by teaching himself to
      observe a neatness of domestic and general management that told him he
      certainly was not as good as a woman. Herbert delighted in them. The cook
      regaled the carpenter with skilful, tasty, and economic dishes; and the
      carpenter, obedient to her supplications, had promised, in the event of
      his outliving her, that no hands but his should have the making of her
      coffin. “It is so nice,” she said, “to think one’s own husband will put
      together the box you are to lie in, of his own make!” Had they been even a
      doubtfully united pair, the cook’s anticipation of a comfortable coffin,
      the work of the best carpenter in England, would have kept them together;
      and that which fine cookery does for the cementing of couples needs not to
      be recounted to those who have read a chapter or two of the natural
      history of the male sex.
    </p>
<p>
      “Crickledon, my dear soul, your husband is labouring with a bit of fun,”
       Herbert said to her.
    </p>
<p>
      “He would n’t laugh loud at Punch, for fear of an action,” she replied.
      “He never laughs out till he gets to bed, and has locked the door; and
      when he does he says ‘Hush!’ to me. Tinman is n’t bailiff again just yet,
      and where he has his bailiff’s best Court suit from, you may ask. He
      exercises in it off and on all the week, at night, and sometimes in the
      middle of the day.”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert rallied her for her gossip’s credulity.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s truth,” she declared. “I have it from the maid of the house, little
      Jane, whom he pays four pound a year for all the work of the house: a
      clever little thing with her hands and her head she is; and can read and
      write beautiful; and she’s a mind to leave ‘em if they don’t advance her.
      She knocked and went in while he was full blaze, and bowing his poll to
      his glass. And now he turns the key, and a child might know he was at it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He can’t be such a donkey!”
     </p>
<p>
      “And he’s been seen at the window on the seaside. ‘Who’s your Admiral
      staying at the house on the beach?’ men have inquired as they come ashore.
      My husband has heard it. Tinman’s got it on his brain. He might be cured
      by marriage to a sound-headed woman, but he ‘ll soon be wanting to walk
      about in silk legs if he stops a bachelor. They tell me his old mother
      here had a dress value twenty pound; and pomp’s inherited. Save as he may,
      there’s his leak.”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert’s contempt for Tinman was intense; it was that of the young and
      ignorant who live in their imaginations like spendthrifts, unaware of the
      importance of them as the food of life, and of how necessary it is to
      seize upon the solider one among them for perpetual sustenance when the
      unsubstantial are vanishing. The great event of his bailiff’s term of
      office had become the sun of Tinman’s system. He basked in its rays. He
      meant to be again the proud official, royally distinguished; meantime,
      though he knew not that his days were dull, he groaned under the dulness;
      and, as cart or cab horses, uncomplaining as a rule, show their view of
      the nature of harness when they have release to frisk in a field, it is
      possible that existence was made tolerable to the jogging man by some
      minutes of excitement in his bailiff’s Court suit. Really to pasture on
      our recollections we ought to dramatize them. There is, however, only the
      testimony of a maid and a mariner to show that Tinman did it, and those
      are witnesses coming of particularly long-bow classes, given to magnify
      small items of fact.
    </p>
<p>
      On reaching the hall Herbert found the fire alight in the smoking-room,
      and soon after settling himself there he heard Van Diemen’s voice at the
      hall-door saying good night to Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Thank the Lord! there you are,” said Van Diemen, entering the room. “I
      couldn’t have hoped so much. That rascal!” he turned round to the door.
      “He has been threatening me, and then smoothing me. Hang his oil! It’s
      combustible. And hang the port he’s for laying down, as he calls it.
      ‘Leave it to posterity,’ says I. ‘Why?’ says he. ‘Because the young ones
      ‘ll be better able to take care of themselves,’ says I, and he insists on
      an explanation. I gave it to him. Out he bursts like a wasp’s nest. He may
      have said what he did say in temper. He seemed sorry afterwards—poor
      old Mart! The scoundrel talked of Horse Guards and telegraph wires.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Scoundrel, but more ninny,” said Herbert, full of his contempt. “Dare him
      to do his worst. The General tells me they ‘d be glad to overlook it at
      the Guards, even if they had all the facts. Branding ‘s out of the
      question.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I swear it was done in my time,” cried Van Diemen, all on fire.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s out of the question. You might be advised to leave England for a few
      months. As for the society here—”
     </p>
<p>
      “If I leave, I leave for good. My heart’s broken. I’m disappointed. I’m
      deceived in my friend. He and I in the old days! What’s come to him? What
      on earth is it changes men who stop in England so? It can’t be the
      climate. And did you mention my name to General Fellingham?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Certainly not,” said Herbert. “But listen to me, sir, a moment. Why not
      get together half-a-dozen friends of the neighbourhood, and make a clean
      breast of it. Englishmen like that kind of manliness, and they are sure to
      ring sound to it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I couldn’t!” Van Diemen sighed. “It’s not a natural feeling I have about
      it—I ‘ve brooded on the word. If I have a nightmare, I see Deserter
      written in sulphur on the black wall.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You can’t remain at his mercy, and be bullied as you are. He makes you
      ill, sir. He won’t do anything, but he’ll go on worrying you. I’d stop him
      at once. I’d take the train to-morrow and get an introduction to the
      Commander-in-Chief. He’s the very man to be kind to you in a situation
      like this. The General would get you the introduction.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That’s more to my taste; but no, I couldn’t,” Van Diemen moaned in his
      weakness. “Money has unmanned me. I was n’t this kind of man formerly; nor
      more was Mart Tinman, the traitor! All the world seems changeing for the
      worse, and England is n’t what she used to be.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You let that man spoil it for you, sir.” Herbert related Mrs.
      Crickledon’s tale of Mr. Tinman, adding, “He’s an utter donkey. I should
      defy him. What I should do would be to let him know to-morrow morning that
      you don’t intend to see him again. Blow for, blow, is the thing he
      requires. He’ll be cringing to you in a week.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And you’d like to marry Annette,” said Van Diemen, relishing,
      nevertheless, the advice, whose origin and object he perceived so plainly.
    </p>
<p>
      “Of course I should,” said Herbert, franker still in his colour than his
      speech.
    </p>
<p>
      “I don’t see him my girl’s husband.” Van Diemen eyed the red hollow in the
      falling coals. “When I came first, and found him a healthy man,
      good-looking enough for a trifle over forty, I ‘d have given her gladly,
      she nodding Yes. Now all my fear is she’s in earnest. Upon my soul, I had
      the notion old Mart was a sort of a boy still; playing man, you know. But
      how can you understand? I fancied his airs and stiffness were put on;
      thought I saw him burning true behind it. Who can tell? He seems to be
      jealous of my buying property in his native town. Something frets him. I
      ought never to have struck him! There’s my error, and I repent it. Strike
      a friend! I wonder he didn’t go off to the Horse Guards at once. I might
      have done it in his place, if I found I couldn’t lick him. I should have
      tried kicking first.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, shinning before peaching,” said Herbert, astonished almost as much
      as he was disgusted by the inveterate sentimental attachment of Van Diemen
      to his old friend.
    </p>
<p>
      Martin Tinman anticipated good things of the fright he had given the man
      after dinner. He had, undoubtedly, yielded to temper, forgetting pure
      policy, which it is so exceeding difficult to practice. But he had soothed
      the startled beast; they had shaken hands at parting, and Tinman hoped
      that the week of Annette’s absence would enable him to mould her father.
      Young Fellingham’s appointment to come to Elba had slipped Mr. Tinman’s
      memory. It was annoying to see this intruder. “At all events, he’s not
      with Annette,” said Mrs. Cavely. “How long has her father to run on?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Five months,” Tinman replied. “He would have completed his term of
      service in five months.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And to think of his being a rich man because he deserted,” Mrs. Cavely
      interjected. “Oh! I do call it immoral. He ought to be apprehended and
      punished, to be an example for the good of society. If you lose time, my
      dear Martin, your chance is gone. He’s wriggling now. And if I could
      believe he talked us over to that young impudent, who has n’t a penny that
      he does n’t get from his pen, I’d say, denounce him to-morrow. I long for
      Elba. I hate this house. It will be swallowed up some day; I know it; I
      have dreamt it. Elba at any cost. Depend upon it, Martin, you have been
      foiled in your suits on account of the mean house you inhabit. Enter Elba
      as that girl’s husband, or go there to own it, and girls will crawl to
      you.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You are a ridiculous woman, Martha,” said Tinman, not dissenting.
    </p>
<p>
      The mixture of an idea of public duty with a feeling of personal rancour
      is a strong incentive to the pursuit of a stern line of conduct; and the
      glimmer of self-interest superadded does not check the steps of the
      moralist. Nevertheless, Tinman held himself in. He loved peace. He
      preached it, he disseminated it. At a meeting in the town he strove to win
      Van Diemen’s voice in favour of a vote for further moneys to protect “our
      shores.” Van Diemen laughed at him, telling him he wanted a battery. “No,”
       said Tinman, “I’ve had enough to do with soldiers.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How’s that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “They might be more cautious. I say, they might learn to know their
      friends from their enemies.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That’s it, that’s it,” said Van Diemen. “If you say much more, my hearty,
      you’ll find me bidding against you next week for Marine Parade and Belle
      Vue Terrace. I’ve a cute eye for property, and this town’s looking up.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You look about you before you speculate in land and house property here,”
       retorted Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen bore so much from him that he asked himself whether he could be
      an Englishman. The title of Deserter was his raw wound. He attempted to
      form the habit of stigmatizing himself with it in the privacy of his
      chamber, and he succeeded in establishing the habit of talking to himself,
      so that he was heard by the household, and Annette, on her return, was
      obliged to warn him of his indiscretion. This development of a new
      weakness exasperated him. Rather to prove his courage by defiance than to
      baffle Tinman’s ambition to become the principal owner of houses in
      Crikswich, by outbidding him at the auction for the sale of Marine Parade
      and Belle Vue Terrace, Van Diemen ran the houses up at the auction, and
      ultimately had Belle Vue knocked down to him. So fierce was the quarrel
      that Annette, in conjunction with Mrs. Cavely; was called on to interpose
      with her sweetest grace. “My native place,” Tinman said to her; “it is my
      native place. I have a pride in it; I desire to own property in it, and
      your father opposes me. He opposes me. Then says I may have it back at
      auction price, after he has gone far to double the price! I have borne—I
      repeat I have borne too much.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Are n’t your properties to be equal to one?” said Mrs. Cavely, smiling
      mother—like from Tinman to Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      He sought to produce a fondling eye in a wry face, and said, “Yes, I will
      remember that.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Annette will bless you with her dear hand in a month or two at the
      outside,” Mrs. Cavely murmured, cherishingly.
    </p>
<p>
      “She will?” Tinman cracked his body to bend to her.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, I cannot say; do not distress me. Be friendly with papa,” the girl
      resumed, moving to escape.
    </p>
<p>
      “That is the essential,” said Mrs. Cavely; and continued, when Annette had
      gone, “The essential is to get over the next few months, miss, and then to
      snap your fingers at us. Martin, I would force that man to sell you Belle
      Vue under the price he paid for it, just to try your power.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman was not quite so forcible. He obtained Belle Vue at auction price,
      and his passion for revenge was tipped with fire by having it accorded as
      a friend’s favour.
    </p>
<p>
      The poisoned state of his mind was increased by a December high wind that
      rattled his casements, and warned him of his accession of property exposed
      to the elements. Both he and his sister attributed their nervousness to
      the sinister behaviour of Van Diemen. For the house on the beach had only,
      in most distant times, been threatened by the sea, and no house on earth
      was better protected from man,—Neptune, in the shape of a
      coastguard, being paid by Government to patrol about it during the hours
      of darkness. They had never had any fears before Van Diemen arrived, and
      caused them to give thrice their ordinary number of dinners to guests per
      annum. In fact, before Van Diemen came, the house on the beach looked on
      Crikswich without a rival to challenge its anticipated lordship over the
      place, and for some inexplicable reason it seemed to its inhabitants to
      have been a safer as well as a happier residence.
    </p>
<p>
      They were consoled by Tinman’s performance of a clever stroke in privately
      purchasing the cottages west of the town, and including Crickledon’s shop,
      abutting on Marine Parade. Then from the house on the beach they looked at
      an entire frontage of their property.
    </p>
<p>
      They entered the month of February. No further time was to be lost, “or we
      shall wake up to find that man has fooled us,” Mrs. Cavely said. Tinman
      appeared at Elba to demand a private interview with Annette. His hat was
      blown into the hall as the door opened to him, and he himself was glad to
      be sheltered by the door, so violent was the gale. Annette and her father
      were sitting together. They kept the betrothed gentleman waiting a very
      long time. At last Van Diemen went to him, and said, “Netty ‘ll see you,
      if you must. I suppose you have no business with me?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not to-day,” Tinman replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen strode round the drawing-room with his hands in his pockets.
      “There’s a disparity of ages,” he said, abruptly, as if desirous to pour
      out his lesson while he remembered it. “A man upwards of forty marries a
      girl under twenty, he’s over sixty before she’s forty; he’s decaying when
      she’s only mellow. I ought never to have struck you, I know. And you’re
      such an infernal bad temper at times, and age does n’t improve that, they
      say; and she’s been educated tip-top. She’s sharp on grammar, and a man
      may n’t like that much when he’s a husband. See her, if you must. But she
      does n’t take to the idea; there’s the truth. Disparity of ages and
      unsuitableness of dispositions—what was it Fellingham said?—like
      two barrel-organs grinding different tunes all day in a house.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t want to hear Mr. Fellingham’s comparisons,” Tinman snapped.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! he’s nothing to the girl,” said Van Diemen. “She doesn’t stomach
      leaving me.”
     </p>
<p>
      “My dear Philip! why should she leave you? When we have interests in
      common as one household—”
     </p>
<p>
      “She says you’re such a damned bad temper.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman was pursuing amicably, “When we are united—” But the
      frightful charge brought against his temper drew him up. “Fiery I may be.
      Annette has seen I am forgiving. I am a Christian. You have provoked me;
      you have struck me.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I ‘ll give you a couple of thousand pounds in hard money to be off the
      bargain, and not bother the girl,” said Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now,” rejoined Tinman, “I am offended. I like money, like most men who
      have made it. You do, Philip. But I don’t come courting like a pauper. Not
      for ten thousand; not for twenty. Money cannot be a compensation to me for
      the loss of Annette. I say I love Annette.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Because,” Van Diemen continued his speech, “you trapped us into that
      engagement, Mart. You dosed me with the stuff you buy for wine, while your
      sister sat sugaring and mollifying my girl; and she did the trick in a
      minute, taking Netty by surprise when I was all heart and no head; and
      since that you may have seen the girl turn her head from marriage like my
      woods from the wind.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Van Diemen Smith!” Tinman panted; he mastered himself. “You shall not
      provoke me. My introductions of you in this neighbourhood, my patronage,
      prove my friendship.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You’ll be a good old fellow, Mart, when you get over your hopes of being
      knighted.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Fellingham may set you against my wine, Philip. Let me tell you—I
      know you—you would not object to have your daughter called Lady.”
     </p>
<p>
      “With a spindle-shanked husband capering in a Court suit before he goes to
      bed every night, that he may n’t forget what a fine fellow he was one day
      bygone! You’re growing lean on it, Mart, like a recollection fifty years
      old.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You have never forgiven me that day, Philip!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Jealous, am I? Take the money, give up the girl, and see what friends
      we’ll be. I’ll back your buyings, I’ll advertise your sellings. I’ll pay a
      painter to paint you in your Court suit, and hang up a copy of you in my
      diningroom.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Annette is here,” said Tinman, who had been showing Etna’s tokens of
      insurgency.
    </p>
<p>
      He admired Annette. Not till latterly had Herbert Fellingham been so true
      an admirer of Annette as Tinman was. She looked sincere and she dressed
      inexpensively. For these reasons she was the best example of womankind
      that he knew, and her enthusiasm for England had the sympathetic effect on
      him of obscuring the rest of the world, and thrilling him with the
      reassuring belief that he was blest in his blood and his birthplace—points
      which her father, with his boastings of Gippsland, and other people
      talking of scenes on the Continent, sometimes disturbed in his mind.
    </p>
<p>
      “Annette,” said he, “I come requesting to converse with you in private.”
     </p>
<p>
      “If you wish it—I would rather not,” she answered.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman raised his head, as often at Helmstone when some offending
      shopwoman was to hear her doom.
    </p>
<p>
      He bent to her. “I see. Before your father, then!”
     </p>
<p>
      “It isn’t an agreeable bit of business, to me,” Van Diemen grumbled,
      frowning and shrugging.
    </p>
<p>
      “I have come, Annette, to ask you, to beg you, entreat—before a
      third person—laughing, Philip?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The wrong side of my mouth, my friend. And I’ll tell you what: we’re in
      for heavy seas, and I ‘m not sorry you’ve taken the house on the beach off
      my hands.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pray, Mr. Tinman, speak at once, if you please, and I will do my best.
      Papa vexes you.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, no,” replied Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      He renewed his commencement. Van Diemen interrupted him again.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hang your power over me, as you call it. Eh, old Mart? I’m a Deserter.
      I’ll pay a thousand pounds to the British army, whether they punish me or
      not. March me off tomorrow!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Papa, you are unjust, unkind.” Annette turned to him in tears.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, no,” said Tinman, “I do not feel it. Your father has misunderstood
      me, Annette.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am sure he has,” she said fervently. “And, Mr. Tinman, I will
      faithfully promise that so long as you are good to my dear father, I will
      not be untrue to my engagement, only do not wish me to name any day. We
      shall be such very good dear friends if you consent to this. Will you?”
     </p>
<p>
      Pausing for a space, the enamoured man unrolled his voice in lamentation:
      “Oh! Annette, how long will you keep me?”
     </p>
<p>
      “There; you’ll set her crying!” said Van Diemen. “Now you can run
      upstairs, Netty. By jingo! Mart Tinman, you’ve got a bass voice for love
      affairs.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Annette,” Tinman called to her, and made her turn round as she was
      retiring. “I must know the day before the end of winter. Please. In kind
      consideration. My arrangements demand it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do let the girl go,” said Van Diemen. “Dine with me tonight and I’ll give
      you a wine to brisk your spirits, old boy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thank you. When I have ordered dinner at home, I——and my wine
      agrees with ME,” Tinman replied.
    </p>
<p>
      “I doubt it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You shall not provoke me, Philip.”
     </p>
<p>
      They parted stiffly.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Cavely had unpleasant domestic news to communicate to her brother, in
      return for his tale of affliction and wrath. It concerned the ungrateful
      conduct of their little housemaid Jane, who, as Mrs. Cavely said, “egged
      on by that woman Crickledon,” had been hinting at an advance of wages.
    </p>
<p>
      “She didn’t dare speak, but I saw what was in her when she broke a plate,
      and wouldn’t say she was sorry. I know she goes to Crickledon and talks us
      over. She’s a willing worker, but she has no heart.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman had been accustomed in his shop at Helmstone—where heaven had
      blessed him with the patronage of the rich, as visibly as rays of supernal
      light are seen selecting from above the heads of prophets in the
      illustrations to cheap holy books—to deal with willing workers that
      have no hearts. Before the application for an advance of wages—and
      he knew the signs of it coming—his method was to calculate how much
      he might be asked for, and divide the estimated sum by the figure 4;
      which, as it seemed to come from a generous impulse, and had been
      unsolicited, was often humbly accepted, and the willing worker pursued her
      lean and hungry course in his service. The treatment did not always agree
      with his males. Women it suited; because they do not like to lift up their
      voices unless they are in a passion; and if you take from them the grounds
      of temper, you take their words away—you make chickens of them. And
      as Tinman said, “Gratitude I never expect!” Why not? For the reason that
      he knew human nature. He could record shocking instances of the
      ingratitude of human nature, as revealed to him in the term of his tenure
      of the shop at Helmstone. Blest from above, human nature’s wickedness had
      from below too frequently besulphured and suffumigated him for his memory
      to be dim; and though he was ever ready to own himself an example that
      heaven prevaileth, he could cite instances of scandal-mongering shop-women
      dismissed and working him mischief in the town, which pointed to him in
      person for a proof that the Powers of Good and Evil were still engaged in
      unhappy contention. Witness Strikes! witness Revolutions!
    </p>
<p>
      “Tell her, when she lays the cloth, that I advance her, on account of
      general good conduct, five shillings per annum. Add,” said Tinman, “that I
      wish no thanks. It is for her merits—to reward her; you understand
      me, Martha?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Quite; if you think it prudent, Martin.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I do. She is not to breathe a syllable to cook.”
     </p>
<p>
      “She will.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then keep your eye on cook.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Cavely promised she would do so. She felt sure she was paying five
      shillings for ingratitude; and, therefore, it was with humility that she
      owned her error when, while her brother sipped his sugared acrid liquor
      after dinner (in devotion to the doctor’s decree, that he should take a
      couple of glasses, rigorously as body-lashing friar), she imparted to him
      the singular effect of the advance of wages upon little Jane—“Oh,
      ma’am! and me never asked you for it!” She informed her brother how little
      Jane had confided to her that they were called “close,” and how little
      Jane had vowed she would—the willing little thing!—go about
      letting everybody know their kindness.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes! Ah!” Tinman inhaled the praise. “No, no; I don’t want to be puffed,”
       he said. “Remember cook. I have,” he continued, meditatively, “rarely
      found my plan fail. But mind, I give the Crickledons notice to quit
      to-morrow. They are a pest. Besides, I shall probably think of erecting
      villas.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How dreadful the wind is!” Mrs. Cavely exclaimed. “I would give that girl
      Annette one chance more. Try her by letter.”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman despatched a business letter to Annette, which brought back a
      vague, unbusiness-like reply. Two days afterward Mrs. Cavely reported to
      her brother the presence of Mr. Fellingham and Miss Mary Fellingham in
      Crikswich. At her dictation he wrote a second letter. This time the reply
      came from Van Diemen:
    </p>
<pre>
   “My DEAR MARTIN,—Please do not go on bothering my girl. She does
   not like the idea of leaving me, and my experience tells me I could
   not live in the house with you. So there it is. Take it friendly.
   I have always wanted to be, and am,

                    “Your friend,

                            “PHIL.”
 </pre>
<p>
      Tinman proceeded straight to Elba; that is, as nearly straight as the wind
      would allow his legs to walk. Van Diemen was announced to be out; Miss
      Annette begged to be excused, under the pretext that she was unwell; and
      Tinman heard of a dinner-party at Elba that night.
    </p>
<p>
      He met Mr. Fellingham on the carriage drive. The young Londoner presumed
      to touch upon Tinman’s private affairs by pleading on behalf of the
      Crikledons, who were, he said, much dejected by the notice they had
      received to quit house and shop.
    </p>
<p>
      “Another time,” bawled Tinman. “I can’t hear you in this wind.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Come in,” said Fellingham.
    </p>
<p>
      “The master of the house is absent,” was the smart retort roared at him;
      and Tinman staggered away, enjoying it as he did his wine.
    </p>
<p>
      His house rocked. He was backed by his sister in the assurance that he had
      been duped.
    </p>
<p>
      The process he supposed to be thinking, which was the castigation of his
      brains with every sting wherewith a native touchiness could ply immediate
      recollection, led him to conclude that he must bring Van Diemen to his
      senses, and Annette running to him for mercy.
    </p>
<p>
      He sat down that night amid the howling of the storm, wind whistling,
      water crashing, casements rattling, beach desperately dragging, as by the
      wide-stretched star-fish fingers of the half-engulphed.
    </p>
<p>
      He hardly knew what he wrote. The man was in a state of personal terror,
      burning with indignation at Van Diemen as the main cause of his jeopardy.
      For, in order to prosecute his pursuit of Annette, he had abstained from
      going to Helmstone to pay moneys into his bank there, and what was
      precious to life as well as life itself, was imperilled by those two—Annette
      and her father—who, had they been true, had they been honest, to say
      nothing of honourable, would by this time have opened Elba to him as a
      fast and safe abode.
    </p>
<p>
      His letter was addressed, on a large envelope,
    </p>
<pre>
   “To the Adjutant-General,

   “HORSE GUARDS.”
 </pre>
<p>
      But if ever consigned to the Post, that post-office must be in London; and
      Tinman left the letter on his desk till the morning should bring counsel
      to him as to the London friend to whom he might despatch it under cover
      for posting, if he pushed it so far.
    </p>
<p>
      Sleep was impossible. Black night favoured the tearing fiends of
      shipwreck, and looking through a back window over sea, Tinman saw with
      dismay huge towering ghostwhite wreaths, that travelled up swiftly on his
      level, and lit the dark as they flung themselves in ruin, with a gasp,
      across the mound of shingle at his feet.
    </p>
<p>
      He undressed: His sister called to him to know if they were in danger.
      Clothed in his dressing-gown, he slipped along to her door, to vociferate
      to her hoarsely that she must not frighten the servants; and one fine
      quality in the training of the couple, which had helped them to prosper, a
      form of self-command, kept her quiet in her shivering fears.
    </p>
<p>
      For a distraction Tinman pulled open the drawers of his wardrobe. His
      glittering suit lay in one. And he thought, “What wonderful changes there
      are in the world!” meaning, between a man exposed to the wrath of the
      elements, and the same individual reading from vellum, in that suit, in a
      palace, to the Head of all of us!
    </p>
<p>
      The presumption is; that he must have often done it before. The fact is
      established, that he did it that night. The conclusion drawn from it is,
      that it must have given him a sense of stability and safety.
    </p>
<p>
      At any rate that he put on the suit is quite certain.
    </p>
<p>
      Probably it was a work of ingratiation and degrees; a feeling of the silk,
      a trying on to one leg, then a matching of the fellow with it. O you
      Revolutionists! who would have no state, no ceremonial, and but one order
      of galligaskins! This man must have been wooed away in spirit to
      forgetfulness of the tempest scourging his mighty neighbour to a bigger
      and a farther leap; he must have obtained from the contemplation of
      himself in his suit that which would be the saving of all men, in especial
      of his countrymen—imagination, namely.
    </p>
<p>
      Certain it is, as I have said, that he attired himself in the suit. He
      covered it with his dressing-gown, and he lay down on his bed so garbed,
      to await the morrow’s light, being probably surprised by sleep acting upon
      fatigue and nerves appeased and soothed.

<h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
<p>
      Elba lay more sheltered from South-east winds under the slopes of down
      than any other house in Crikswich. The South-caster struck off the cliff
      to a martello tower and the house on the beach, leaving Elba to repose, so
      that the worst wind for that coast was one of the most comfortable for the
      owner of the hall, and he looked from his upper window on a sea of
      crumbling grey chalk, lashed unremittingly by the featureless piping gale,
      without fear that his elevated grounds and walls would be open at high
      tide to the ravage of water. Van Diemen had no idea of calamity being at
      work on land when he sat down to breakfast. He told Herbert that he had
      prayed for poor fellows at sea last night. Mary Fellingham and Annette
      were anxious to finish breakfast and mount the down to gaze on the sea,
      and receiving a caution from Van Diemen not to go too near the cliff, they
      were inclined to think he was needlessly timorous on their account.
    </p>
<p>
      Before they were half way through the meal, word was brought in of great
      breaches in the shingle, and water covering the common. Van Diemen sent
      for his head gardener, whose report of the state of things outside took
      the comprehensive form of prophecy; he predicted the fall of the town.
    </p>
<p>
      “Nonsense; what do you mean, John Scott?” said Van Diemen, eyeing his
      orderly breakfast table and the man in turns. “It does n’t seem like that,
      yet, does it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The house on the beach won’t stand an hour longer, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Who says so?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s cut off from land now, and waves mast-high all about it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mart Tinman?” cried Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      All started; all jumped up; and there was a scampering for hats and
      cloaks. Maids and men of the house ran in and out confirming the news of
      inundation. Some in terror for the fate of relatives, others pleasantly
      excited, glad of catastrophe if it but killed monotony, for at any rate it
      was a change of demons.
    </p>
<p>
      The view from the outer bank of Elba was of water covering the space of
      the common up to the stones of Marine Parade and Belle Vue. But at a
      distance it had not the appearance of angry water; the ladies thought it
      picturesque, and the house on the beach was seen standing firm. A second
      look showed the house completely isolated; and as the party led by Van
      Diemen circled hurriedly toward the town, they discerned heavy cataracts
      of foam pouring down the wrecked mound of shingle on either side of the
      house.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why, the outer wall’s washed away,” said Van Diemen. “Are they in real
      danger?” asked Annette, her teeth chattering, and the cold and other
      matters at her heart precluding for the moment such warmth of sympathy as
      she hoped soon to feel for them. She was glad to hear her father say:
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! they’re high and dry by this time. We shall find them in the town And
      we’ll take them in and comfort them. Ten to one they have n’t breakfasted.
      They sha’n’t go to an inn while I’m handy.”
     </p>
<p>
      He dashed ahead, followed closely by Herbert. The ladies beheld them
      talking to townsfolk as they passed along the upper streets, and did not
      augur well of their increase of speed. At the head of the town water was
      visible, part of the way up the main street, and crossing it, the ladies
      went swiftly under the old church, on the tower of which were spectators,
      through the churchyard to a high meadow that dropped to a stone wall fixed
      between the meadow and a grass bank above the level of the road, where now
      salt water beat and cast some spray. Not less than a hundred people were
      in this field, among them Crickledon and his wife. All were in silent
      watch of the house on the beach, which was to east of the field, at a
      distance of perhaps three stonethrows. The scene was wild. Continuously
      the torrents poured through the shingleclefts, and momently a thunder
      sounded, and high leapt a billow that topped the house and folded it
      weltering.
    </p>
<p>
      “They tell me Mart Tinman’s in the house,” Van Diemen roared to Herbert.
      He listened to further information, and bellowed: “There’s no boat!”
     </p>
<p>
      Herbert answered: “It must be a mistake, I think; here’s Crickledon says
      he had a warning before dawn and managed to move most of his things, and
      the people over there must have been awakened by the row in time to get
      off.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I can’t hear a word you say;” Van Diemen tried to pitch his voice higher
      than the wind. “Did you say a boat? But where?”
     </p>
<p>
      Crickledon the carpenter made signal to Herbert. They stepped rapidly up
      the field.
    </p>
<p>
      “Women feels their weakness in times like these, my dear,” Mrs. Crickledon
      said to Annette. “What with our clothes and our cowardice it do seem we’re
      not the equals of men when winds is high.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette expressed the hope to her that she had not lost much property.
      Mrs. Crickledon said she was glad to let her know she was insured in an
      Accident Company. “But,” said she, “I do grieve for that poor man Tinman,
      if alive he be, and comes ashore to find his property wrecked by water.
      Bless ye! he wouldn’t insure against anything less common than fire; and
      my house and Crickledon’s shop are floating timbers by this time; and
      Marine Parade and Belle Vue are safe to go. And it’ll be a pretty welcome
      for him, poor man, from his investments.”
     </p>
<p>
      A cry at a tremendous blow of a wave on the doomed house rose from the
      field. Back and front door were broken down, and the force of water drove
      a round volume through the channel, shaking the walls.
    </p>
<p>
      “I can’t stand this,” Van Diemen cried.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette was too late to hold him back. He ran up the field. She was
      preparing to run after when Mrs. Crickledon touched her arm and implored
      her: “Interfere not with men, but let them follow their judgements when
      it’s seasons of mighty peril, my dear. If any one’s guilty it’s me, for
      minding my husband of a boat that was launched for a life-boat here, and
      wouldn’t answer, and is at the shed by the Crouch—left lying there,
      I’ve often said, as if it was a-sulking. My goodness!”
     </p>
<p>
      A linen sheet bad been flung out from one of the windows of the house on
      the beach, and flew loose and flapping in sign of distress.
    </p>
<p>
      “It looks as if they had gone mad in that house, to have waited so long
      for to declare theirselves, poor souls,” Mrs. Crickledon said, sighing.
    </p>
<p>
      She was assured right and left that signals had been seen before, and some
      one stated that the cook of Mr. Tinman, and also Mrs. Cavely, were on
      shore.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s his furniture, poor man, he sticks to: and nothing gets round the
      heart so!” resumed Mrs. Crickledon. “There goes his bed-linen!”
     </p>
<p>
      The sheet was whirled and snapped away by the wind; distended doubled,
      like a flock of winter geese changeing alphabetical letters on the clouds,
      darted this way and that, and finally outspread on the waters breaking
      against Marine Parade.
    </p>
<p>
      “They cannot have thought there was positive danger in remaining,” said
      Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Tinman was waiting for the cheapest Insurance office,” a man remarked
      to Mrs. Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “The least to pay is to the undertaker,” she replied, standing on tiptoe.
      “And it’s to be hoped he ‘ll pay more to-day. If only those walls don’t
      fall and stop the chance of the boat to save him for more outlay, poor
      man! What boats was on the beach last night, high up and over the ridge as
      they was, are planks by this time and only good for carpenters.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Half our town’s done for,” one old man said; and another followed him in
      a pious tone: “From water we came and to water we go.”
     </p>
<p>
      They talked of ancient inroads of the sea, none so serious as this
      threatened to be for them. The gallant solidity, of the house on the beach
      had withstood heavy gales: it was a brave house. Heaven be thanked, no
      fishing boats were out. Chiefly well-to-do people would be the sufferers—an
      exceptional case. For it is the mysterious and unexplained dispensation
      that: “Mostly heaven chastises we.”
     </p>
<p>
      A knot of excited gazers drew the rest of the field to them. Mrs.
      Crickledon, on the edge of the crowd, reported what was doing to Annette
      and Miss Fellingham. A boat had been launched from the town. “Praise the
      Lord, there’s none but coastguard in it!” she exclaimed, and excused
      herself for having her heart on her husband.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette was as deeply thankful that her father was not in the boat.
    </p>
<p>
      They looked round and saw Herbert beside them. Van Diemen was in the rear,
      panting, and straining his neck to catch sight of the boat now pulling
      fast across a tumbled sea to where Tinman himself was perceived, beckoning
      them wildly, half out of one of the windows.
    </p>
<p>
      “A pound apiece to those fellows, and two if they land Mart Tinman dry;
      I’ve promised it, and they’ll earn it. Look at that! Quick, you rascals!”
     </p>
<p>
      To the east a portion of the house had fallen, melted away. Where it
      stood, just below the line of shingle, it was now like a structure wasting
      on a tormented submerged reef. The whole line was given over to the waves.
    </p>
<p>
      “Where is his sister?” Annette shrieked to her father.
    </p>
<p>
      “Safe ashore; and one of the women with her. But Mart Tinman would stop,
      the fool! to-poor old boy! save his papers and things; and has n’t a head
      to do it, Martha Cavely tells me. They’re at him now! They’ve got him in!
      There’s another? Oh! it’s a girl, who would n’t go and leave him. They’ll
      pull to the field here. Brave lads!—By jingo, why ain’t Englishmen
      always in danger!—eh? if you want to see them shine!”
     </p>
<p>
      “It’s little Jane,” said Mrs. Crickledon, who had been joined by her
      husband, and now that she knew him to be no longer in peril, kept her hand
      on him to restrain him, just for comfort’s sake.
    </p>
<p>
      The boat held under the lee of the house-wreck a minute; then, as if
      shooting a small rapid, came down on a wave crowned with foam, to hurrahs
      from the townsmen.
    </p>
<p>
      “They’re all right,” said Van Diemen, puffing as at a mist before his
      eyes. “They’ll pull westward, with the wind, and land him among us. I
      remember when old Mart and I were bathing once, he was younger than me,
      and could n’t swim much, and I saw him going down. It’d have been hard to
      see him washed off before one’s eyes thirty years afterwards. Here they
      come. He’s all right. He’s in his dressing-gown!”
     </p>
<p>
      The crowd made way for Mr. Van Diemen Smith to welcome his friend. Two of
      the coastguard jumped out, and handed him to the dry bank, while Herbert,
      Van Diemen, and Crickledon took him by hand and arm, and hoisted him on to
      the flint wall, preparatory to his descent into the field. In this exposed
      situation the wind, whose pranks are endless when it is once up, seized
      and blew Martin Tinman’s dressing-gown wide as two violently flapping
      wings on each side of him, and finally over his head.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen turned a pair of stupefied flat eyes on Herbert, who cast a sly
      look at the ladies. Tinman had sprung down. But not before the world, in
      one tempestuous glimpse, had caught sight of the Court suit.
    </p>
<p>
      Perfect gravity greeted him from the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
      “Safe, old Mart! and glad to be able to say it,” said Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      “We are so happy,” said Annette.
    </p>
<p>
      “House, furniture, property, everything I possess!” ejaculated Tinman,
      shivering.
    </p>
<p>
      “Fiddle, man; you want some hot breakfast in you. Your sister has gone on—to
      Elba. Come you too, old Man; and where’s that plucky little girl who stood
      by—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Was there a girl?” said Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, and there was a boy wanted to help.” Van Diemen pointed at Herbert.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman looked, and piteously asked, “Have you examined Marine Parade and
      Belle Vue? It depends on the tide!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Here is little Jane, sir,” said Mrs. Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “Fall in,” Van Diemen said to little Jane.
    </p>
<p>
      The girl was bobbing curtseys to Annette, on her introduction by Mrs.
      Crickledon.
    </p>
<p>
      “Martin, you stay at my house; you stay at Elba till you get things
      comfortable about you, and then you shall have the Crouch for a year, rent
      free. Eh, Netty?”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette chimed in: “Anything we can do, anything. Nothing can be too
      much.”
     </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen was praising little Jane for her devotion to her master.
    </p>
<p>
      “Master have been so kind to me,” said little Jane.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now, march; it is cold,” Van Diemen gave the word, and Herbert stood by
      Mary rather dejectedly, foreseeing that his prospects at Elba were
      darkened.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now then, Mart, left leg forward,” Van Diemen linked his arm in his
      friend’s.
    </p>
<p>
      “I must have a look,” Tinman broke from him, and cast a forlorn look of
      farewell on the last of the house on the beach.
    </p>
<p>
      “You’ve got me left to you, old Mart; don’t forget that,” said Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      Tinman’s chest fell. “Yes, yes,” he responded. He was touched.
    </p>
<p>
      “And I told those fellows if they landed you dry they should have—I’d
      give them double pay; and I do believe they’ve earned their money.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t think I’m very wet, I’m cold,” said Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “You can’t help being cold, so come along.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But, Philip!” Tinman lifted his voice; “I’ve lost everything. I tried to
      save a little. I worked hard, I exposed my life, and all in vain.”
     </p>
<p>
      The voice of little Jane was heard.
    </p>
<p>
      “What’s the matter with the child?” said Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      Annette went up to her quietly.
    </p>
<p>
      But little Jane was addressing her master.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! if you please, I did manage to save something the last thing when the
      boat was at the window, and if you please, sir, all the bundles is lost,
      but I saved you a papercutter, and a letter Horse Guards, and here they
      are, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      The grateful little creature drew the square letter and paper-cutter from
      her bosom, and held them out to Mr. Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a letter of the imposing size, with THE HORSE GUARDS very
      distinctly inscribed on it in Tinman’s best round hand, to strike his
      vindictive spirit as positively intended for transmission, and give him
      sight of his power to wound if it pleased him; as it might.
    </p>
<p>
      “What!” cried he, not clearly comprehending how much her devotion had
      accomplished for him.
    </p>
<p>
      “A letter to the Horse Guards!” cried Van Diemen.
    </p>
<p>
      “Here, give it me,” said little Jane’s master, and grasped it nervously.
    </p>
<p>
      “What’s in that letter?” Van Diemen asked. “Let me look at that letter.
      Don’t tell me it’s private correspondence.”
     </p>
<p>
      “My dear Philip, dear friend, kind thanks; it’s not a letter,” said
      Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not a letter! why, I read the address, ‘Horse Guards.’ I read it as it
      passed into your hands. Now, my man, one look at that letter, or take the
      consequences.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Kind thanks for your assistance, dear Philip, indeed! Oh! this? Oh! it’s
      nothing.” He tore it in halves.
    </p>
<p>
      His face was of the winter sea-colour, with the chalk wash on it.
    </p>
<p>
      “Tear again, and I shall know what to think of the contents,” Van Diemen
      frowned. “Let me see what you’ve said. You’ve sworn you would do it, and
      there it is at last, by miracle; but let me see it and I’ll overlook it,
      and you shall be my house-mate still. If not!——”
     </p>
<p>
      Tinman tore away.
    </p>
<p>
      “You mistake, you mistake, you’re entirely wrong,” he said, as he pursued
      with desperation his task of rendering every word unreadable.
    </p>
<p>
      Van Diemen stood fronting him; the accumulation of stores of petty
      injuries and meannesses which he had endured from this man, swelled under
      the whip of the conclusive exhibition of treachery. He looked so black
      that Annette called, “Papa!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Philip,” said Tinman. “Philip! my best friend!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pooh, you’re a poor creature. Come along and breakfast at Elba, and you
      can sleep at the Crouch, and goodnight to you. Crickledon,” he called to
      the houseless couple, “you stop at Elba till I build you a shop.”
     </p>
<p>
      With these words, Van Diemen led the way, walking alone. Herbert was
      compelled to walk with Tinman.
    </p>
<p>
      Mary and Annette came behind, and Mary pinched Annette’s arm so sharply
      that she must have cried out aloud had it been possible for her to feel
      pain at that moment, instead of a personal exultation, flying wildly over
      the clash of astonishment and horror, like a sea-bird over the foam.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first silent place they came to, Mary murmured the words: “Little
      Jane.”
     </p>
<p>
      Annette looked round at Mrs. Crickledon, who wound up the procession,
      taking little Jane by the hand. Little Jane was walking demurely, with a
      placid face. Annette glanced at Tinman. Her excited feelings nearly rose
      to a scream of laughter. For hours after, Mary had only to say to her:
      “Little Jane,” to produce the same convulsion. It rolled her heart and
      senses in a headlong surge, shook her to burning tears, and seemed to her
      ideas the most wonderful running together of opposite things ever known on
      this earth. The young lady was ashamed of her laughter; but she was deeply
      indebted to it, for never was mind made so clear by that beneficent
      exercise.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
<h3>
      HE
    </h3>
<p>
      Passing over Ickleworth Bridge and rounding up the heavily-shadowed river
      of our narrow valley, I perceived a commotion as of bathers in a certain
      bright space immediately underneath the vicar’s terrace-garden steps. My
      astonishment was considerable when it became evident to me that the vicar
      himself was disporting in the water, which, reaching no higher than his
      waist, disclosed him in the ordinary habiliments of his cloth. I knew my
      friend to be one of the most absent-minded of men, and my first effort to
      explain the phenomenon of his appearance there, suggested that he might
      have walked in, the victim of a fit of abstraction, and that he had not
      yet fully comprehended his plight; but this idea was dispersed when I
      beheld the very portly lady, his partner in joy and adversity, standing
      immersed, and perfectly attired, some short distance nearer to the bank.
      As I advanced along the bank opposed to them, I was further amazed to hear
      them discoursing quite equably together, so that it was impossible to say
      on the face of it whether a catastrophe had occurred, or the great heat of
      a cloudless summer day had tempted an eccentric couple to seek for
      coolness in the directest fashion, without absolute disregard to
      propriety. I made a point of listening for the accentuation of the ‘my
      dear’ which was being interchanged, but the key-note to the harmony
      existing between husband and wife was neither excessively unctuous, nor
      shrewd, and the connubial shuttlecock was so well kept up on both sides
      that I chose to await the issue rather than speculate on the origin of
      this strange exhibition. I therefore, as I could not be accused of an
      outrage to modesty, permitted myself to maintain what might be invidiously
      termed a satyr-like watch from behind a forward flinging willow, whose
      business in life was to look at its image in a brown depth, branches,
      trunk, and roots. The sole indication of discomfort displayed by the pair
      was that the lady’s hand worked somewhat fretfully to keep her dress from
      ballooning and puffing out of all proportion round about her person, while
      the vicar, who stood without his hat, employed a spongy handkerchief from
      time to time in tempering the ardours of a vertical sun. If you will
      consent to imagine a bald blackbird, his neck being shrunk in
      apprehensively, as you may see him in the first rolling of the thunder,
      you will gather an image of my friend’s appearance.
    </p>
<p>
      He performed his capital ablutions with many loud ‘poofs,’ and a casting
      up of dazzled eyes, an action that gave point to his recital of the
      invocation of Chryses to Smintheus which brought upon the Greeks disaster
      and much woe. Between the lines he replied to his wife, whose remarks
      increased in quantity, and also, as I thought, in emphasis, under the
      river of verse which he poured forth unbaffled, broadening his chest to
      the sonorous Greek music in a singular rapture of obliviousness.
    </p>
<p>
      A wise man will not squander his laughter if he can help it, but will keep
      the agitation of it down as long as he may. The simmering of humour sends
      a lively spirit into the mind, whereas the boiling over is but a prodigal
      expenditure and the disturbance of a clear current: for the comic element
      is visible to you in all things, if you do but keep your mind charged with
      the perception of it, as I have heard a great expounder deliver himself on
      another subject; and he spoke very truly. So, I continued to look on with
      the gravity of Nature herself, and I could not but fancy, and with less
      than our usual wilfulness when we fancy things about Nature’s moods, that
      the Mother of men beheld this scene with half a smile, differently from
      the simple observation of those cows whisking the flies from their flanks
      at the edge of the shorn meadow and its aspens, seen beneath the curved
      roof of a broad oak-branch. Save for this happy upward curve of the
      branch, we are encompassed by breathless foliage; even the gloom was hot;
      the little insects that are food for fish tried a flight and fell on the
      water’s surface, as if panting. Here and there, a sullen fish consented to
      take them, and a circle spread, telling of past excitement.
    </p>
<p>
      I had listened to the vicar’s Homeric lowing for the space of a minute or
      so—what some one has called, the great beast-like, bellow-like, roar
      and roll of the Iliad hexameter: it stopped like a cut cord. One of the
      numerous daughters of his house appeared in the arch of white
      cluster-roses on the lower garden-terrace, and with an exclamation, stood
      petrified at the extraordinary spectacle, and then she laughed outright. I
      had hitherto resisted, but the young lady’s frank and boisterous laughter
      carried me along, and I too let loose a peal, and discovered myself. The
      vicar, seeing me, acknowledged a consciousness of his absurd position with
      a laugh as loud. As for the scapegrace girl, she went off into a run of
      high-pitched shriekings like twenty woodpeckers, crying: I Mama, mama, you
      look as if you were in Jordan!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The vicar cleared his throat admonishingly, for it was apparent that Miss
      Alice was giving offence to her mother, and I presume he thought it was
      enough for one of the family to have done so.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Wilt thou come out of Jordan?’ I cried.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am sufficiently baptized with the water,’ said the helpless man...
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Indeed, Mr. Amble,’ observed his spouse, ‘you can lecture a woman for not
      making the best of circumstances; I hope you’ll bear in mind that it’s you
      who are irreverent. I can endure this no longer. You deserve Mr.
      Pollingray’s ridicule.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Upon this, I interposed: ‘Pray, ma’am, don’t imagine that you have
      anything but sympathy from me.’—but as I was protesting, having my
      mouth open, the terrible Miss Alice dragged the laughter remorselessly out
      of me.
    </p>
<p>
      They have been trying Frank’s new boat, Mr. Pollingray, and they’ve upset
      it. Oh! oh’ and again there was the woodpeckers’ chorus.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Alice, I desire you instantly to go and fetch John the gardener,’ said
      the angry mother.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mama, I can’t move; wait a minute, only a minute. John’s gone about the
      geraniums. Oh! don’t look so resigned, papa; you’ll kill me! Mama, come
      and take my hand. Oh! oh!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The young lady put her hands in against her waist and rolled her body like
      a possessed one.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why don’t you come in through the boat-house?’ she asked when she had
      mastered her fit.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said the vicar. I beheld him struck by this new thought.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How utterly absurd you are, Mr. Amble!’ exclaimed his wife, ‘when you
      know that the boat-house is locked, and that the boat was lying under the
      camshot when you persuaded me to step into it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Hearing this explanation of the accident, Alice gave way to an
      ungovernable emotion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You see, my dear,’ the vicar addressed his wife, she can do nothing; it’s
      useless. If ever patience is counselled to us, it is when accidents befall
      us, for then, as we are not responsible, we know we are in other hands,
      and it is our duty to be comparatively passive. Perhaps I may say that in
      every difficulty, patience is a life-belt. I beg of you to be patient
      still.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr. Amble, I shall think you foolish,’ said the spouse, with a nod of
      more than emphasis.
    </p>
<p>
      My dear, you have only to decide,’ was the meek reply.
    </p>
<p>
      By this time, Miss Alice had so far conquered the fiend of laughter that
      she could venture to summon her mother close up to the bank and extend a
      rescuing hand. Mrs. Amble waded to within reach, her husband following.
      Arrangements were made for Alice to pull, and the vicar to push; both in
      accordance with Mrs. Amble’s stipulations, for even in her extremity of
      helplessness she affected rule and sovereignty. Unhappily, at the decisive
      moment, I chanced (and I admit it was more than an inadvertence on my
      part, it was a most ill-considered thing to do) I chanced, I say, to call
      out—and that I refrained from quoting Voltaire is something in my
      favour:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How on earth did you manage to tumble in?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no contest of opinion that I might have kept my curiosity
      waiting, and possibly it may be said with some justification that I was
      the direct cause of my friend’s unparalleled behaviour; but could a mortal
      man guess that in the very act of assisting his wife’s return to dry land,
      and while she was—if I may put it so—modestly in his hands, he
      would turn about with a quotation that compared him to old Palinurus, all
      the while allowing his worthy and admirable burden to sink lower and
      dispread in excess upon the surface of the water, until the vantage of her
      daughter’s help was lost to her; I beheld the consequences of my
      indiscretion, dismayed. I would have checked the preposterous Virgilian,
      but in contempt of my uplifted hand and averted head, and regardless of
      the fact that his wife was then literally dependent upon him, the vicar
      declaimed (and the drenching effect produced by Latin upon a lady at such
      a season, may be thought on):
    </p>
<pre>
        Vix primos inopina quies laxaverat artus,
        Et super incumbens, cum puppis parte revulsa
        Cumque gubernaclo liquidas projecit in undas.’ 
</pre>
<p>
      It is not easy when you are unacquainted with the language, to retort upon
      Latin, even when the attempt to do so is made in English. Very few even of
      the uneducated ears can tolerate such anti-climax vituperative as English
      after sounding Latin. Mrs. Amble kept down those sentiments which her
      vernacular might have expressed. I heard but one groan that came from her
      as she lay huddled indistinguishably in the arms of her husband.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not—praecipitem! I am happy to say,’ my senseless friend remarked
      further, and laughed cheerfully as he fortified his statement with a run
      of negatives. ‘No, no’; in a way peculiar to him. ‘No, no. If I plant my
      grey hairs anywhere, it will be on dry land: no. But, now, my dear; he
      returned to his duty; why, you’re down again. Come: one, two, and up.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He was raising a dead weight. The passion for sarcastic speech was
      manifestly at war with common prudence in the bosom of Mrs. Amble;
      prudence, however, overcame it. She cast on him a look of a kind that
      makes matrimony terrific in the dreams of bachelors, and then wedding her
      energy to the assistance given she made one of those senseless springs of
      the upper half of the body, which strike the philosophic eye with the
      futility of an effort that does not arise from a solid basis. Owing to the
      want of concert between them, the vicar’s impulsive strength was expended
      when his wife’s came into play. Alice clutched her mother bravely. The
      vicar had force enough to stay his wife’s descent; but Alice (she boasts
      of her muscle) had not the force in the other direction—and no
      wonder. There are few young ladies who could pull fourteen stone sheer up
      a camshot.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Amble remained in suspense between the two.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, Mr. Pollingray, if you were only on this side to help us,’ Miss Alice
      exclaimed very piteously, though I could see that she was half mad with
      the internal struggle of laughter at the parents and concern for them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, pull, Alice,’ shouted the vicar.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, not yet,’ screamed Mrs. Amble; I’m sinking.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pull, Alice.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, Mama.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Push, Papa.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m down.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Up, Ma’am; Jane; woman, up.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gently, Papa: Abraham, I will not.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear, but you must.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And that man opposite.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What, Pollingray? He’s fifty.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I found myself walking indignantly down the path. Even now I protest my
      friend was guilty of bad manners, though I make every allowance for him; I
      excuse, I pass the order; but why—what justifies one man’s bawling
      out another man’s age? What purpose does it serve? I suppose the vicar
      wished to reassure his wife, on the principle (I have heard him enunciate
      it) that the sexes are merged at fifty—by which he means, I must
      presume, that something which may be good or bad, and is generally silly—of
      course, I admire and respect modesty and pudeur as much as any man—something
      has gone: a recognition of the bounds of division. There is, if that is a
      lamentable matter, a loss of certain of our young tricks at fifty. We have
      ceased to blush readily: and let me ask you to define a blush. Is it an
      involuntary truth or an ingenuous lie? I know that this will sound like
      the language of a man not a little jealous of his youthful compeers. I can
      but leave it to rightly judging persons to consider whether a healthy man
      in his prime, who has enough, and is not cursed by ambition, need be
      jealous of any living soul.
    </p>
<p>
      A shriek from Miss Alice checked my retreating steps. The vicar was
      staggering to support the breathing half of his partner while she regained
      her footing in the bed of the river. Their effort to scale the camshot had
      failed. Happily at this moment I caught sight of Master Frank’s boat,
      which had floated, bottom upwards, against a projecting mud-bank of
      forget-me-nots. I contrived to reach it and right it, and having secured
      one of the sculls, I pulled up to the rescue; though not before I had
      plucked a flower, actuated by a motive that I cannot account for. The
      vicar held the boat firmly against the camshot, while I, at the imminent
      risk of joining them (I shall not forget the combined expression of Miss
      Alice’s retreating eyes and the malicious corners of her mouth) hoisted
      the lady in, and the river with her. From the seat of the boat she stood
      sufficiently high to project the step towards land without peril. When she
      had set her foot there, we all assumed an attitude of respectful
      attention, and the vicar, who could soar over calamity like a fairweather
      swallow, acknowledged the return of his wife to the element with a series
      of apologetic yesses and short coughings.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That would furnish a good concert for the poets,’ he remarked. ‘A
      parting, a separation of lovers; “even as a body from the watertorn,” or
      “from the water plucked”; eh? do you think—“so I weep round her,
      tearful in her track,” an excellent—’ 
    </p>
<p>
      But the outraged woman, dripping in grievous discomfort above him, made a
      peremptory gesture.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr. Amble, will you come on shore instantly, I have borne with your
      stupidity long enough. I insist upon your remembering, sir, that you have
      a family dependent upon you. Other men may commit these follies.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      This was a blow at myself, a bachelor whom the lady had never persuaded to
      dream of relinquishing his freedom.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear, I am coming,’ said the vicar.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, come at once, or I shall think you idiotic,’ the wife retorted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have been endeavouring,’ the vicar now addressed me, ‘to prove by a
      practical demonstration that women are capable of as much philosophy as
      men, under any sudden and afflicting revolution of circumstances.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And if you get a sunstroke, you will be rightly punished, and I shall not
      be sorry, Mr. Amble.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am coming, my dear Jane. Pray run into the house and change your
      things.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not till I see you out of the water, sir.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are losing your temper, my love.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You would make a saint lose his temper, Mr. Amble.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There were female saints, my dear,’ the vicar mildly responded; and
      addressed me further: ‘Up to this point, I assure you, Pollingray, no
      conduct could have been more exemplary than Mrs. Amble’s. I had got her
      into the boat—a good boat, a capital boat—but getting in
      myself, we overturned. The first impulse of an ordinary woman would have
      been to reproach and scold; but Mrs. Amble succumbed only to the first
      impulse. Discovering that all effort unaided to climb the bank was
      fruitless, she agreed to wait patiently and make the best of
      circumstances; and she did; and she learnt to enjoy it. There is marrow in
      every bone. My dear. Jane, I have never admired you so much. I tried her,
      Pollingray, in metaphysics. I talked to her of the opera we last heard, I
      think fifty years ago. And as it is less endurable for a woman to be
      patient in tribulation—the honour is greater, when she overcomes the
      fleshy trial. Insomuch,’ the vicar put on a bland air of abnegation of
      honour, ‘that I am disposed to consider any male philosopher our superior;
      when you’ve found one, ha, ha—when you’ve found one. O sol pulcher!
      I am ready to sing that the day has been glorious, so far. Pulcher ille
      dies.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Amble appealed to me. ‘Would anybody not swear that he is mad to see
      him standing waist-deep in the water and the sun on his bald head, I am
      reduced to entreat you not to—though you have no family of your own—not
      to encourage him. It is amusing to you. Pray, reflect that such folly is
      too often fatal. Compel him to come on shore.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The logic of the appeal was no doubt distinctly visible in the lady’s
      mind, though it was not accurately worded. I saw that I stood marked to be
      the scape goat of the day, and humbly continued to deserve well,
      notwithstanding. By dint of simple signs and nods of affirmative, and a
      constant propulsion of my friend’s arm, I drew him into the boat, and
      thence projected him up to the level with his wife, who had perhaps
      deigned to understand that it was best to avoid the arresting of his
      divergent mind by any remark during the passage, and remained silent. No
      sooner was he established on his feet, than she plucked him away.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your papa’s hat,’ she called, flashing to her daughter, and streamed up
      the lawn into the rose-trellised pathways leading on aloft to the vicarage
      house. Behind roses the weeping couple disappeared. The last I saw of my
      friend was a smiting of his hand upon his head in a vain effort to catch
      at one of the fleeting ideas sowed in him by the quick passage of objects
      before his vision, and shaken out of him by abnormal hurry. The Rev.
      Abraham Amble had been lord of his wife in the water, but his innings was
      over. He had evidently enjoyed it vastly, and I now understood why he had
      chosen to prolong it as much as possible. Your eccentric characters are
      not uncommonly amateurs of petty artifice. There are hours of vengeance
      even for henpecked men.
    </p>
<p>
      I found myself sighing over the enslaved condition of every Benedict of my
      acquaintance, when the thought came like a surprise that I was alone with
      Alice. The fair and pleasant damsel made a clever descent into the boat,
      and having seated herself, she began to twirl the scull in the rowlock,
      and said: ‘Do you feel disposed to join me in looking after the other
      scull and papa’s hat, Mr. Pollingray?’ I suggested ‘Will you not get your
      feet wet? I couldn’t manage to empty all the water in the boat.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh’ cried she, with a toss of her head; I wet feet never hurt young
      people.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      There was matter for an admonitory lecture in this. Let me confess I was
      about to give it, when she added: But Mr. Pollingray, I am really afraid
      that your feet are wet! You had to step into the water when you righted
      the boat:
    </p>
<p>
      My reply was to jump down by her side with as much agility as I could
      combine with a proper discretion. The amateur craft rocked threateningly,
      and I found myself grasped by and grasping the pretty damsel, until by
      great good luck we were steadied and preserved from the same misfortune
      which had befallen her parents. She laughed and blushed, and we tottered
      asunder.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Would you have talked metaphysics to me in the water, Mr. Pollingray?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Alice was here guilty of one of those naughty sort of innocent speeches
      smacking of Eve most strongly; though, of course, of Eve in her best days.
    </p>
<p>
      I took the rudder lines to steer against the sculling of her single scull,
      and was Adam enough to respond to temptation: ‘I should perhaps have been
      grateful to your charitable construction of it as being metaphysics.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      She laughed colloquially, to fill a pause. It had not been coquetry:
      merely the woman unconsciously at play. A man is bound to remember the
      seniority of his years when this occurs, for a veteran of ninety and a
      worn out young debauchee will equally be subject to it if they do not shun
      the society of the sex. My long robust health and perfect self-reliance
      apparently tend to give me unguarded moments, or lay me open to fitful
      impressions. Indeed there are times when I fear I have the heart of a boy,
      and certainly nothing more calamitous can be conceived, supposing that it
      should ever for one instant get complete mastery of my head. This is the
      peril of a man who has lived soberly. Do we never know when we are safe? I
      am, in reflecting thereupon, positively prepared to say that if there is
      no fool like what they call an old fool (and a man in his prime, who can
      be laughed at, is the world’s old fool) there is wisdom in the wild oats
      theory, and I shall come round to my nephew’s way of thinking: that is, as
      far as Master Charles by his acting represents his thinking. I shall at
      all events be more lenient in my judgement of him, and less stern in my
      allocutions, for I shall have no text to preach from.
    </p>
<p>
      We picked up the hat and the scull in one of the little muddy bays of our
      brown river, forming an amphitheatre for water-rats and draped with great
      dockleaves, nettle-flowers, ragged robins, and other weeds for which the
      learned young lady gave the botanical names. It was pleasant to hear her
      speak with the full authority of absolute knowledge of her subject. She
      has intelligence. She is decidedly too good for Charles, unless he changes
      his method of living.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Shall we row on?’ she asked, settling her arms to work the pair of
      sculls.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have me in your power,’ said I, and she struck out. Her shape is
      exceedingly graceful; I was charmed by the occasional tightening in of her
      lips as she exerted her muscle, while at intervals telling me of her race
      with one of her boastful younger brothers, whom she had beaten. I believe
      it is only when they are using physical exertion that the eyes of young
      girls have entire simplicity—the simplicity of nature as opposed to
      that other artificial simplicity which they learn from their governesses,
      their mothers, and the admiration of witlings. Attractive purity, or the
      nice glaze of no comprehension of anything which is considered to be
      improper in a wicked world, and is no doubt very useful, is not to my
      taste. French girls, as a rule, cannot compete with our English in the
      purer graces. They are only incomparable when as women they have resort to
      art.
    </p>
<p>
      Alice could look at me as she rowed, without thinking it necessary to
      force a smile, or to speak, or to snigger and be foolish. I felt towards
      the girl like a comrade.
    </p>
<p>
      We went no further than Hatchard’s mile, where the water plumps the poor
      sleepy river from a sidestream, and, as it turned the boat’s head quite
      round, I let the boat go. These studies of young women are very well as a
      pastime; but they soon cease to be a recreation. She forms an agreeable
      picture when she is rowing, and possesses a musical laugh. Now and then
      she gives way to the bad trick of laughing without caring or daring to
      explain the cause for it. She is moderately well-bred. I hope that she has
      principle. Certain things a man of my time of life learns by associating
      with very young people which are serviceable to him. What a different
      matter this earth must be to that girl from what it is to me! I knew it
      before. And—mark the difference—I feel it now.

<h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<h3>
      SHE
    </h3>
<p>
      Papa never will cease to meet with accidents and adventures. If he only
      walks out to sit for half an hour with one of his old dames, as he calls
      them, something is sure to happen to him, and it is almost as sure that
      Mr. Pollingray will be passing at the time and mixed up in it.
    </p>
<p>
      Since Mr. Pollingray’s return from his last residence on the Continent, I
      have learnt to know him and like him. Charles is unjust to his uncle. He
      is not at all the grave kind of man I expected from Charles’s description.
      He is extremely entertaining, and then he understands the world, and I
      like to hear him talk, he is so unpretentious and uses just the right
      words. No one would imagine his age, from his appearance, and he has more
      fun than any young man I have listened to.
    </p>
<p>
      But, I am convinced I have discovered his weakness. It is my fatal.
      peculiarity that I cannot be with people ten minutes without seeing some
      point about them where they are tenderest. Mr. Pollingray wants to be
      thought quite youthful. He can bear any amount of fatigue; he is always
      fresh and a delightful companion; but you cannot get him to show even a
      shadow of exhaustion or to admit that he ever knew what it was to lie down
      beaten. This is really to pretend that he is superhuman. I like him so
      much that I could wish him superior to such—it is nothing other than—vanity.
      Which is worse? A young man giving himself the air of a sage, or—but
      no one can call Mr. Pollingray an old man. He is a confirmed bachelor.
      That puts the case. Charles, when he says of him that he is a ‘gentleman
      in a good state of preservation,’ means to be ironical. I doubt whether
      Charles at fifty would object to have the same said of Mr. Charles
      Everett. Mr. Pollingray has always looked to his health. He has not been
      disappointed. I am sure he was always very good. But, whatever he was, he
      is now very pleasant, and he does not talk to women as if he thought them
      singular, and feel timid, I mean, confused, as some men show that they
      feel—the good ones. Perhaps he felt so once, and that is why he is
      still free. Charles’s dread that his uncle will marry is most unworthy. He
      never will, but why should he not? Mama declares that he is waiting for a
      woman of intellect, I can hear her: ‘Depend upon it, a woman of intellect
      will marry Dayton Manor.’ Should that mighty event not come to pass, poor
      Charles will have to sink the name of Everett in that of Pollingray. Mr.
      Pollingray’s name is the worst thing about him. When I think of his name I
      see him ten times older than he is. My feelings are in harmony with his
      pedigree concerning the age of the name. One would have to be a woman of
      profound intellect to see the advantage of sharing it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mrs. Pollingray!’ She must be a lady with a wig.
    </p>
<p>
      It was when we were rowing up by Hatchard’s mill that I first perceived
      his weakness, he was looking at me so kindly, and speaking of his
      friendship for papa, and how glad he was to be fixed at last, near to us
      at Dayton. I wished to use some term of endearment in reply, and said, I
      remember, ‘Yes, and we are also glad, Godpapa.’ I was astonished that he
      should look so disconcerted, and went on: ‘Have you forgotten that you are
      my godpapa?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He answered: ‘Am I? Oh! yes—the name of Alice.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Still he looked uncertain, uncomfortable, and I said, ‘Do you want to
      cancel the past, and cast me off?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, certainly not’; he, I suppose, thought he was assuring me.
    </p>
<p>
      I saw his lips move at the words I cancel the past,’ though he did not
      speak them out. He positively blushed. I know the sort of young man he
      must have been. Exactly the sort of young man mama would like for a
      son-in-law, and her daughters would accept in pure obedience when reduced
      to be capable of the virtue by rigorous diet, or consumption.
    </p>
<p>
      He let the boat go round instantly. This was enough for me. It struck me
      then that when papa had said to mama (as he did in that absurd situation)
      ‘He is fifty,’ Mr. Pollingray must have heard it across the river, for he
      walked away hurriedly. He came back, it is true, with the boat, but I have
      my own ideas. He is always ready to do a service, but on this occasion I
      think it was an afterthought. I shall not venture to call him ‘Godpapa’ 
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, if I have a desire, it is that I may be blind to people’s
      weakness. My insight is inveterate. Papa says he has heard Mr. Pollingray
      boast of his age. If so, there has come a change over him. I cannot be
      deceived. I see it constantly. After my unfortunate speech, Mr. Pollingray
      shunned our house for two whole weeks, and scarcely bowed to us when
      coming out of church. Miss Pollingray idolises him—spoils him. She
      says that he is worth twenty of Charles. Nous savons ce que nous savons,
      nous autres. Charles is wild, but Charles would be above these
      littlenesses. How could Miss Pollingray comprehend the romance of
      Charles’s nature?
    </p>
<p>
      My sister Evelina is now Mr. Pollingray’s favourite. She could not say
      Godpapa to him, if she would. Persons who are very much petted at home,
      are always establishing favourites abroad. For my part, let them praise me
      or not, I know that I can do any thing I set my mind upon. At present I
      choose to be frivolous. I know I am frivolous. What then? If there is fun
      in the world am I not to laugh at it? I shall astonish them by and by.
      But, I will laugh while I can. I am sure, there is so much misery in the
      world, it is a mercy to be able to laugh. Mr. Pollingray may think what he
      likes of me. When Charles tells me that I must do my utmost to propitiate
      his uncle, he cannot mean that I am to refrain from laughing, because that
      is being a hypocrite, which I may become when I have gone through all the
      potential moods and not before.
    </p>
<p>
      It is preposterous to suppose that I am to be tied down to the views of
      life of elderly people.
    </p>
<p>
      I dare say I did laugh a little too much the other night, but could I help
      it? We had a dinner party. Present were Mr. Pollingray, Mrs. Kershaw, the
      Wilbury people (three), Charles, my brother Duncan, Evelina, mama, papa,
      myself, and Mr. and Mrs. (put them last for emphasis) Romer Pattlecombe,
      Mrs. Pattlecombe (the same number of syllables as Pollingray, and a ‘P’ to
      begin with) is thirty-one years her husband’s junior, and she is
      twenty-six; full of fun, and always making fun of him, the mildest,
      kindest, goody old thing, who has never distressed himself for anything
      and never will. Mrs. Romer not only makes fun, but is fun. When you have
      done laughing with her, you can laugh at her. She is the salt of society
      in these parts. Some one, as we were sitting on the lawn after dinner,
      alluded to the mishap to papa and mama, and mama, who has never forgiven
      Mr. Pollingray for having seen her in her ridiculous plight, said that men
      were in her opinion greater gossips than women. ‘That is indisputable,
      ma’am,’ said Mr. Pollingray, he loves to bewilder her; ‘only, we never
      mention it.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is an excuse for us,’ said Mrs. Romer; ‘our trials are so great, we
      require a diversion, and so we talk of others.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now really,’ said Charles, ‘I don’t think your trials are equal to ours.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      For which remark papa bantered him, and his uncle was sharp on him; and
      Charles, I know, spoke half seriously, though he was seeking to draw Mrs.
      Romer out: he has troubles.
    </p>
<p>
      From this, we fell upon a comparison of sufferings, and Mrs. Romer took up
      the word. She is a fair, smallish, nervous woman, with delicate hands and
      outlines, exceedingly sympathetic; so much so that while you are telling
      her anything, she makes half a face in anticipation, and is ready to
      shriek with laughter or shake her head with uttermost grief; and
      sometimes, if you let her go too far in one direction, she does both. All
      her narrations are with ups and downs of her hands, her eyes, her chin,
      and her voice. Taking poor, good old Mr. Romer by the roll of his coat,
      she made as if posing him, and said: ‘There! Now, it’s all very well for
      you to say that there is anything equal to a woman’s sufferings in this
      world. I do declare you know nothing of what we unhappy women have to
      endure. It’s dreadful! No male creature can possibly know what tortures I
      have to undergo.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Mama neatly contrived, after interrupting her, to divert the subject. I
      think that all the ladies imagined they were in jeopardy, but I knew Mrs.
      Romer was perfectly to be trusted. She has wit which pleases, jusqu’aux
      ongles, and her sense of humour never overrides her discretion with more
      than a glance—never with preparation.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now,’ she pursued, ‘let me tell you what excruciating trials I have to go
      through. This man,’ she rocked the patient old gentleman to and fro, ‘this
      man will be the death of me. He is utterly devoid of a sense of propriety.
      Again and again I say to him—cannot the tailor cut down these
      trowsers of yours? Yes, Mr. Amble, you preach patience to women, but this
      is too much for any woman’s endurance. Now, do attempt to picture to
      yourself what an agony it must be to me:—he will shave, and he will
      wear those enormously high trowsers that, when they are braced, reach up
      behind to the nape of his neck! Only yesterday morning, as I was lying in
      bed, I could see him in his dressing-room. I tell you: he will shave, and
      he will choose the time for shaving early after he has braced these
      immensely high trowsers that make such a placard of him. Oh, my goodness!
      My dear Romer, I have said to him fifty times if I have said it once, my
      goodness me! why can you not get decent trowsers such as other men wear?
      He has but one answer—he has been accustomed to wear those trowsers,
      and he would not feel at home in another pair. And what does he say if I
      continue to complain? and I cannot but continue to complain, for it is not
      only moral, it is physical torment to see the sight he makes of himself;
      he says: “My dear, you should not have married an old man.” What! I say to
      him, must an old man wear antiquated trowsers? No! nothing will turn him;
      those are his habits. But, you have not heard the worst. The sight of
      those hideous trowsers totally destroying all shape in the man, is
      horrible enough; but it is absolutely more than a woman can bear to see
      him—for he will shave—first cover his face with white soap
      with that ridiculous centre-piece to his trowsers reaching quite up to his
      poll, and then, you can fancy a woman’s rage and anguish! the figure lifts
      its nose by the extremist tip. Oh! it’s degradation! What respect can a
      woman have for her husband after that sight? Imagine it! And I have
      implored him to spare me. It’s useless. You sneer at our hbops and say
      that you are inconvenienced by them but you gentlemen are not degraded,—Oh!
      unutterably!—as I am every morning of my life by that cruel
      spectacle of a husband.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I have but faintly sketched Mrs. Romer’s style. Evelina, who is prudish
      and thinks her vulgar, refused to laugh, but it came upon me, as the
      picture of ‘your own old husband,’ with so irresistibly comic an effect
      that I was overcome by convulsions of laughter. I do not defend myself. It
      was as much a fit as any other attack. I did all I could to arrest it. At
      last, I ran indoors and upstairs to my bedroom and tried hard to become
      dispossessed. I am sure I was an example of the sufferings of my sex. It
      could hardly have been worse for Mrs. Romer than it was for me. I was
      drowned in internal laughter long after I had got a grave face. Early in
      the evening Mr. Pollingray left us.

<h3>
      HE
    </h3>
<p>
      I am carried by the fascination of a musical laugh. Apparently I am doomed
      to hear it at my own expense. We are secure from nothing in this life.
    </p>
<p>
      I have determined to stand for the county. An unoccupied man is a prey to
      every hook of folly. Be dilettante all your days, and you might as fairly
      hope to reap a moral harvest as if you had chased butterflies. The
      activities created by a profession or determined pursuit are necessary to
      the growth of the mind.
    </p>
<p>
      Heavens! I find myself writing like an illegitimate son of La
      Rochefoucauld, or of Vauvenargues. But, it is true that I am fifty years
      old, and I am not mature. I am undeveloped somewhere.
    </p>
<p>
      The question for me to consider is, whether this development is to be
      accomplished by my being guilty of an act of egregious folly.
    </p>
<p>
      Dans la cinquantaine! The reflection should produce a gravity in men. Such
      a number of years will not ring like bridal bells in a man’s ears. I have
      my books about me, my horses, my dogs, a contented household. I move in
      the centre of a perfect machine, and I am dissatisfied. I rise early. I do
      not digest badly. What is wrong?
    </p>
<p>
      The calamity of my case is that I am in danger of betraying what is wrong
      with me to others, without knowing it myself. Some woman will be
      suspecting and tattling, because she has nothing else to do. Girls have
      wonderfully shrewd eyes for a weakness in the sex which they are
      instructed to look upon as superior. But I am on my guard.
    </p>
<p>
      The fact is manifest: I feel I have been living more or less uselessly. It
      is a fat time. There are a certain set of men in every prosperous country
      who, having wherewithal, and not being compelled to toil, become subjected
      to the moral ideal. Most of them in the end sit down with our sixth Henry
      or second Richard and philosophise on shepherds. To be no better than a
      simple hind! Am I better? Prime bacon and an occasional draft of shrewd
      beer content him, and they do not me. Yet I am sound, and can sit through
      the night and be ready, and on the morrow I shall stand for the county.
    </p>
<p>
      I made the announcement that I had thoughts of entering Parliament, before
      I had half formed the determination, at my sister’s lawn party yesterday.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gilbert!’ she cried, and raised her hands. A woman is hurt if you do not
      confide to her your plans as soon as you can conceive them. She must be
      present to assist at the birth, or your plans are unblessed plans.
    </p>
<p>
      I had been speaking aside in a casual manner to my friend Amble, whose
      idea is that the Church is not represented with sufficient strength in the
      Commons, and who at once, as I perceived, grasped the notion of getting me
      to promote sundry measures connected with schools and clerical stipends,
      for his eyes dilated; he said: ‘Well, if you do, I can put you up to
      several things,’ and imparting the usual chorus of yesses to his own mind,
      he continued absently: ‘Pollingray might be made strong on church rates.
      There is much to do. He has lived abroad and requires schooling in these
      things. We want a man. Yes, yes, yes. It’s a good idea; a notion.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      My sister, however, was of another opinion. She did me the honour to take
      me aside.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gilbert, were you serious just now?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Quite serious. Is it not my characteristic?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not on these occasions. I saw the idea come suddenly upon you. You were
      looking at Charles.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Continue: and at what was he looking?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He was looking at Alice Amble.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And the young lady?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She looked at you.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I was here attacked by a singularly pertinacious fly, and came out of the
      contest with a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did she have that condescension towards me? And from the glance, my
      resolution to enter Parliament was born? It is the French vaudevilliste’s
      doctrine of great events from little causes. The slipper of a soubrette
      trips the heart of a king and changes the destiny of a nation-the history
      of mankind. It may be true. If I were but shot into the House from a
      little girl’s eye!’ 
    </p>
<p>
      With this I took her arm gaily, walked with her, and had nearly
      overreached myself with excess of cunning. I suppose we are reduced to see
      more plainly that which we systematically endeavour to veil from others.
      It is best to flutter a handkerchief, instead of nailing up a curtain. The
      principal advantage is that you may thereby go on deceiving yourself, for
      this reason: few sentiments are wholly matter of fact; but when they are
      half so, you make them concrete by deliberately seeking either to crush or
      conceal them, and you are doubly betrayed—betrayed to the besieging
      eye and to yourself. When a sentiment has grown to be a passion
      (mercifully may I be spared!) different tactics are required. By that
      time, you will have already betrayed yourself too deeply to dare to be
      flippant: the investigating eye is aware that it has been purposely
      diverted: knowing some things, it makes sure of the rest from which you
      turn it away. If you want to hide a very grave case, you must speak
      gravely about it.—At which season, be but sure of your voice, and
      simulate a certain depth of sentimental philosophy, and you may once more,
      and for a long period, bewilder the investigator of the secrets of your
      bosom. To sum up: in the preliminary stages of a weakness, be careful that
      you do not show your own alarm, or all will be suspected. Should the
      weakness turn to fever, let a little of it be seen, like a careless man,
      and nothing will really be thought.
    </p>
<p>
      I can say this, I can do this; and is it still possible that a pin’s point
      has got through the joints of the armour of a man like me?
    </p>
<p>
      Elizabeth quitted my side with the conviction that I am as considerate an
      uncle as I am an affectionate brother.
    </p>
<p>
      I said to her, apropos, ‘I have been observing those two. It seems to me
      they are deciding things for themselves.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have been going to speak to you about them Gilbert,’ said she.
    </p>
<p>
      And I: ‘The girl must be studied. The family is good. While Charles is in
      Wales, you must have her at Dayton. She laughs rather vacantly, don’t you
      think? but the sound of it has the proper wholesome ring. I will give her
      what attention I can while she is here, but in the meantime I must have a
      bride of my own and commence courting.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Parliament, you mean,’ said Elizabeth with a frank and tender smile. The
      hostess was summoned to welcome a new guest, and she left me, pleased with
      her successful effort to reach my meaning, and absorbed by it.
    </p>
<p>
      I would not have challenged Machiavelli; but I should not have encountered
      the Florentine ruefully. I feel the same keen delight in intellectual
      dexterity. On some points my sister is not a bad match for me. She can
      beat me seven games out of twelve at chess; but the five I win sequently,
      for then I am awake. There is natural art and artificial art, and the last
      beats the first. Fortunately for us, women are strangers to the last. They
      have had to throw off a mask before they have, got the schooling; so, when
      they are thus armed we know what we meet, and what are the weapons to be
      used.
    </p>
<p>
      Alice, if she is a fine fencer at all, will expect to meet the ordinary
      English squire in me. I have seen her at the baptismal font! It is
      inconceivable. She will fancy that at least she is ten times more subtle
      than I. When I get the mastery—it is unlikely to make me the master.
      What may happen is, that the nature of the girl will declare itself, under
      the hard light of intimacy, vulgar. Charles I cause to be absent for six
      weeks; so there will be time enough for the probation. I do not see him
      till he returns. If by chance I had come earlier to see him and he to
      allude to her, he would have had my conscience on his side, and that is
      what a scrupulous man takes care to prevent.
    </p>
<p>
      I wonder whether my friends imagine me to be the same man whom they knew
      as Gilbert Pollingray a month back? I see the change, I feel the change;
      but I have no retrospection, no remorse, no looking forward, no feeling:
      none for others, very little, for myself. I am told that I am losing
      fluency as a dinner-table talker. There is now more savour to me in a
      silvery laugh than in a spiced wit. And this is the man who knows women,
      and is far too modest to give a decided opinion upon any of their merits.
      Search myself through as I may, I cannot tell when the change began, or
      what the change consists of, or what is the matter with me, or what charm
      there is in the person who does the mischief. She is the counterpart of
      dozens of girls; lively, brown-eyed, brown-haired, underbred—it is
      not too harsh to say so—underbred slightly; half-educated, whether
      quickwitted I dare not opine. She is undoubtedly the last whom I or
      another person would have fixed upon as one to work me this unmitigated
      evil. I do not know her, and I believe I do not care to know her, and I am
      thirsting for the hour to come when I shall study her. Is not this to have
      the poison of a bite in one’s blood? The wrath of Venus is not a fable. I
      was a hard reader and I despised the sex in my youth, before the family
      estates fell to me; since when I have playfully admired the sex; I have
      dallied with a passion, and not read at all, save for diversion: her anger
      is not a fable. You may interpret many a mythic tale by the facts which
      lie in your own blood. My emotions have lain altogether dormant in
      sentimental attachment. I have, I suppose, boasted of, Python slain, and
      Cupid has touched me up with an arrow. I trust to my own skill rather than
      to his mercy for avoiding a second from his quiver. I will understand this
      girl if I have to submit to a close intimacy with her for six months.
      There is no doubt of the elegance of her movements. Charles might as well
      take his tour, and let us see him again next year. Yes, her movements are
      (or will be) gracious. In a year’s time she will have acquired the fuller
      tones and poetry of womanliness. Perhaps then, too, her smile will linger
      instead of flashing. I have known infinitely lovelier women than she. One
      I have known! but let her be. Louise and I have long since said adieu.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<h3>
      SHE
    </h3>
<p>
      Behold me installed in Dayton Manor House, and brought here for the
      express purpose (so Charles has written me word) of my being studied, that
      it may be seen whether I am worthy to be, on some august future occasion—possibly—a
      member (Oh, so much to mumble!) of this great family. Had I known it when
      I was leaving home, I should have countermanded the cording of my boxes.
      If you please, I do the packing, and not the cording. I must practise
      being polite, or I shall be horrifying these good people.
    </p>
<p>
      I am mortally offended. I am very very angry. I shall show temper. Indeed,
      I have shown it. Mr. Pollingray must and does think me a goose. Dear sir,
      and I think you are justified. If any one pretends to guess how, I have
      names to suit that person. I am a ninny, an ape, and mind I call myself
      these bad things because I deserve worse. I am flighty, I believe I am
      heartless. Charles is away, and I suffer no pangs. The truth is, I fancied
      myself so exceedingly penetrating, and it was my vanity looking in a
      glass. I saw something that answered to my nods and howd’ye-do’s and—but
      I am ashamed, and so penitent I might begin making a collection of
      beetles. I cannot lift up my head.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Pollingray is such a different man from the one I had imagined! What
      that one was, I have now quite forgotten. I remember too clearly what the
      wretched guesser was. I have been three weeks at Dayton, and if my sisters
      know me when I return to the vicarage, they are not foolish virgins. For
      my part, I know that I shall always hate Mrs. Romer Pattlecombe, and that
      I am unjust to the good woman, but I do hate her, and I think the stories
      shocking, and wonder intensely what it was that I could have found in them
      to laugh at. I shall never laugh again for many years. Perhaps, when I am
      an old woman, I may. I wish the time had come. All young people seem to me
      so helplessly silly. I am one of them for the present, and have no hope
      that I can appear to be anything else. The young are a crowd—a shoal
      of small fry. Their elders are the select of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      On the morning of the day when I was to leave home for Dayton, a distance
      of eight miles, I looked out of my window while dressing—as early as
      halfpast seven—and I saw Mr. Pollingray’s groom on horseback,
      leading up and down the walk a darling little, round, plump, black cob
      that made my heart leap with an immense bound of longing to be on it and
      away across the downs. And then the maid came to my door with a letter:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr. Pollingray, in return for her considerate good behaviour and saving
      of trouble to him officially, begs his goddaughter to accept the
      accompanying little animal: height 14 h., age 31 years; hunts, is
      sure-footed, and likely to be the best jumper in the county.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I flew downstairs. I rushed out of the house and up to my treasure, and
      kissed his nose and stroked his mane. I could not get my fingers away from
      him. Horses are so like the very best and beautifullest of women when you
      caress them. They show their pleasure so at being petted. They curve their
      necks, and paw, and look proud. They take your flattery like sunshine and
      are lovely in it. I kissed my beauty, peering at his black-mottled skin,
      which is like Allingborough Heath in the twilight. The smell of his new
      saddle and bridle-leather was sweeter than a garden to me. The man handed
      me a large riding-whip mounted with silver. I longed to jump up and ride
      till midnight.
    </p>
<p>
      Then mama and papa came out and read the note and looked, at my darling
      little cob, and my sisters saw him and kissed me, for they are not envious
      girls. The most distressing thing was that we had not a riding-habit in
      the family. I was ready to wear any sort. I would have ridden as a guy
      rather than not ride at all. But mama gave me a promise that in two days a
      riding-habit should be sent on to Dayton, and I had to let my pet be led
      back from where he came. I had no life till I was following him. I could
      have believed him to be a fairy prince who had charmed me. I called him
      Prince Leboo, because he was black and good. I forgive anybody who talks
      about first love after what my experience has been with Prince Leboo.
    </p>
<p>
      What papa thought of the present I do not know, but I know very well what
      mama thought: and for my part I thought everything, not distinctly
      including that, for I could not suppose such selfishness in one so
      generous as Mr. Pollingray. But I came to Dayton in a state of arrogant
      pride, that gave assurance if not ease to my manners. I thanked Mr.
      Pollingray warmly, but in a way to let him see it was the matter of a
      horse between us. ‘You give, I register thanks, and there’s an end.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He thinks me a fool! a fool!
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My habit,’ I said, ‘comes after me. I hope we shall have some rides
      together.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Many,’ replied Mr. Pollingray, and his bow inflated me with ideas of my
      condescension.
    </p>
<p>
      And because Miss Pollingray (Queen Elizabeth he calls her) looked half
      sad, I read it—! I do not write what I read it to be.
    </p>
<p>
      Behold the uttermost fool of all female creation led over the house by Mr.
      Pollingray. He showed me the family pictures.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am no judge of pictures, Mr. Pollingray.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will learn to see the merits of these.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m afraid not, though I were to study them for years.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You may have that opportunity.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! that is more than I can expect.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will develop intelligence on such subjects by and by.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      A dull sort of distant blow struck me in this remark; but I paid no heed
      to it.
    </p>
<p>
      He led me over the gardens and the grounds. The Great John Methlyn
      Pollingray planted those trees, and designed the house, and the
      flower-garden still speaks of his task; but he is not my master, and
      consequently I could not share his three great-grandsons’ veneration for
      him. There are high fir-woods and beech woods, and a long ascending narrow
      meadow between them, through which a brook falls in continual cascades. It
      is the sort of scene I love, for it has a woodland grandeur and seclusion
      that leads, me to think, and makes a better girl of me. But what I said
      was: ‘Yes, it is the place of all others to come and settle in for the
      evening of one’s days.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You could not take to it now?’ said Mr. Pollingray.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now?’ my expression of face must have been a picture.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You feel called upon to decline such a residence in the morning of your
      days?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He persisted in looking at me as he spoke, and I felt like something
      withering scarlet.
    </p>
<p>
      I am convinced he saw through me, while his face was polished brass. My
      self-possession returned, for my pride was not to be dispersed
      immediately.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Please, take me to the stables,’ I entreated; and there I was at home.
      There I saw my Prince Leboo, and gave him a thousand caresses.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He knows me already,’ I said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he is some degrees in advance of me,’ said Mr. Pollingray.
    </p>
<p>
      Is not cold dissection of one’s character a cruel proceeding? And I think,
      too, that a form of hospitality like this by which I am invited to be
      analysed at leisure, is both mean and base. I have been kindly treated and
      I am grateful, but I do still say (even though I may have improved under
      it) it is unfair.
    </p>
<p>
      To proceed: the dinner hour arrived. The atmosphere of his own house seems
      to favour Mr. Pollingray as certain soils and sites favour others. He
      walked into the dining-room between us with his hands behind him, talking
      to us both so easily and smoothly cheerfully—naturally and
      pleasantly—inimitable by any young man! You hardly feel the change
      of room. We were but three at table, but there was no lack of
      entertainment. Mr. Pollingray is an admirable host; he talks just enough
      himself and helps you to talk. What does comfort me is that it gives him
      real pleasure to see a hearty appetite. Young men, I know it for a
      certainty, never quite like us to be so human. Ah! which is right? I would
      not miss the faith in our nobler essence which Charles has. But, if it
      nobler? One who has lived longer in the world ought to know better, and
      Mr. Pollingray approves of naturalness in everything. I have now seen
      through Charles’s eyes for several months; so implicitly that I am timid
      when I dream of trusting to another’s judgement. It is, however, a fact
      that I am not quite natural with Charles.
    </p>
<p>
      Every day Mr. Pollingray puts on evening dress out of deference to his
      sister. If young men had these good habits they would gain our respect,
      and lose their own self-esteem less early.
    </p>
<p>
      After dinner I sang. Then Mr. Pollingray read an amusing essay to us, and
      retired to his library. Miss Pollingray sat and talked to me of her
      brother, and of her nephew—for whom it is that Mr. Pollingray is
      beginning to receive company, and is going into society. Charles’s
      subsequently received letter explained the ‘receive company.’ I could not
      comprehend it at the time.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The house has been shut up for years, or rarely inhabited by us for more
      than a month in the year. Mr. Pollingray prefers France. All his
      associations, I may say his sympathies, are in France. Latterly he seems
      to have changed a little; but from Normandy to Touraine and Dauphiny—we
      had a triangular home over there. Indeed, we have it still. I am never
      certain of my brother.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      While Miss Pollingray was speaking, my eyes were fixed on a Vidal crayon
      drawing, faintly coloured with chalks, of a foreign lady—I could
      have sworn to her being French—young, quite girlish, I doubt if her
      age was more than mine.
    </p>
<p>
      She is pretty, is she not?’ said Miss Pollingray.
    </p>
<p>
      She is almost beautiful,’ I exclaimed, and Miss Pollingray, seeing my
      curiosity, was kind enough not to keep me in suspense.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is the Marquise de Mazardouin—nee Louise de Riverolles. You
      will see other portraits of her in the house. This is the most youthful of
      them, if I except one representing a baby, and bearing her initials.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I remembered having noticed a similarity of feature in some of the
      portraits in the different rooms. My longing to look at them again was
      like a sudden jet of flame within me. There was no chance of seeing them
      till morning; so, promising myself to dream of the face before me, I dozed
      through a conversation with my hostess, until I had got the French lady’s
      eyes and hair and general outline stamped accurately, as I hoped, on my
      mind. I was no sooner on my way to bed than all had faded. The torment of
      trying to conjure up that face was inconceivable. I lay, and tossed, and
      turned to right and to left, and scattered my sleep; but by and by my
      thoughts reverted to Mr. Pollingray, and then like sympathetic ink held to
      the heat, I beheld her again; but vividly, as she must have been when she
      was sitting to the artist. The hair was naturally crisped, waving thrice
      over the forehead and brushed clean from the temples, showing the small
      ears, and tied in a knot loosely behind. Her eyebrows were thick and dark,
      but soft; flowing eyebrows; far lovelier, to my thinking, than any
      pencilled arch. Dark eyes, and full, not prominent. I find little
      expression of inward sentiment in very prominent eyes. On the contrary
      they seem to have a fish-like dependency of gaze on what is without, and
      show fishy depths, if any. For instance, my eyes are rather prominent, and
      I am just the little fool—but the French lady is my theme. Madame la
      Marquise, your eyes are sweeter to me than celestial. I never saw such
      candour and unaffected innocence in eyes before. Accept the compliment of
      the pauvre Anglaise. Did you do mischief with them? Did Vidal’s delicate
      sketch do justice to you? Your lips and chin and your throat all repose in
      such girlish grace, that if ever it is my good fortune to see you, you
      will not be aged to me!
    </p>
<p>
      I slept and dreamed of her.
    </p>
<p>
      In the morning, I felt certain that she had often said: ‘Mon cher
      Gilbert,’ to Mr. Pollingray. Had he ever said: ‘Ma chere Louise?’ He might
      have said: ‘Ma bien aimee!’ for it was a face to be loved.
    </p>
<p>
      My change of feeling towards him dates from that morning. He had
      previously seemed to me a man so much older. I perceived in him now a
      youthfulness beyond mere vigour of frame. I could not detach him from my
      dreams of the night. He insists upon addressing me by the terms of our
      ‘official’ relationship, as if he made it a principle of our intercourse.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, and is your godpapa to congratulate you on your having had a quiet
      rest?’ was his greeting.
    </p>
<p>
      I answered stupidly: ‘Oh, yes, thank you,’ and would have given worlds for
      the courage to reply in French, but I distrusted my accent. At breakfast,
      the opportunity or rather the excuse for an attempt, was offered. His
      French valet, Francois, waits on him at breakfast. Mr. Pollingray and his
      sister asked for things in the French tongue, and, as if fearing some
      breach of civility, Mr. Pollingray asked me if I knew French.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I know it; that is, I understand it,’ I stuttered. Allons, nous
      parlerons francais,’ said he. But I shook my head, and remained like a
      silly mute.
    </p>
<p>
      I was induced towards the close of the meal to come out with a few French
      words. I was utterly shamefaced. Mr. Pollingray has got the French manner
      of protesting that one is all but perfect in one’s speaking. I know how
      absurd it must have sounded. But I felt his kindness, and in my heart I
      thanked him humbly. I believe now that a residence in France does not
      deteriorate an Englishman. Mr. Pollingray, when in his own house, has the
      best qualities of the two countries. He is gay, and, yes, while he makes a
      study of me, I am making a study of him. Which of us two will know the
      other first? He was papa’s college friend—papa’s junior, of course,
      and infinitely more papa’s junior now. I observe that weakness in him, I
      mean, his clinging to youthfulness, less and less; but I do see it, I
      cannot be quite in error. The truth is, I begin to feel that I cannot
      venture to mistrust my infallible judgement, or I shall have no confidence
      in myself at all.
    </p>
<p>
      After breakfast, I was handed over to Miss Pollingray, with the intimation
      that I should not see him till dinner.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gilbert is anxious to cultivate the society of his English neighbours,
      now that he has, as he supposes, really settled among them,’ she remarked
      to me. ‘At his time of life, the desire to be useful is almost a malady.
      But, he cherishes the poor, and that is more than an occupation, it is a
      virtue.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Her speech has become occasionally French in the construction of the
      sentences.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mais oui,’ I said shyly, and being alone with her, I was not rebuffed by
      her smile, especially as she encouraged me on.
    </p>
<p>
      I am, she told me, to see a monde of French people here in September. So,
      the story of me is to be completer, or continued in September. I could not
      get Miss Pollingray to tell me distinctly whether Madame la Marquise will
      be one of the guests. But I know that she is not a widow. In that case,
      she has a husband. In that case, what is the story of her relations
      towards Mr. Pollingray? There must be some story. He would not surely have
      so many portraits of her about the house (and they travel with him
      wherever he goes) if she were but a lovely face to him. I cannot
      understand it. They were frequent, constant visitors to one another’s
      estates in France; always together. Perhaps a man of Mr. Pollingray’s age,
      or perhaps M. le Marquis—and here I lose myself. French habits are
      so different from ours. One thing I am certain of: no charge can be
      brought against my Englishman. I read perfect rectitude in his face. I
      would cast anchor by him. He must have had a dreadful unhappiness.
    </p>
<p>
      Mama kept her promise by sending my riding habit and hat punctually, but I
      had run far ahead of all the wishes I had formed when I left home, and I
      half feared my ride out with Mr. Pollingray. That was before I had
      received Charles’s letter, letting me know the object of my invitation
      here. I require at times a morbid pride to keep me up to the work. I
      suppose I rode befittingly, for Mr. Pollingray praised my seat on
      horseback. I know I can ride, or feel the ‘blast of a horse like my own’—as
      he calls it. Yet he never could have had a duller companion. My
      conversation was all yes and no, as if it went on a pair of crutches like
      a miserable cripple. I was humiliated and vexed. All the while I was
      trying to lead up to the French lady, and I could not commence with a
      single question. He appears to, have really cancelled the past in every
      respect save his calling me his goddaughter. His talk was of the English
      poor, and vegetation, and papa’s goodness to his old dames in Ickleworth
      parish, and defects in my education acknowledged by me, but not likely to
      restore me in my depressed state. The ride was beautiful. We went the
      length of a twelve-mile ridge between Ickleworth and Hillford, over high
      commons, with immense views on both sides, and through beech-woods,
      oakwoods, and furzy dells and downs spotted with juniper and yewtrees—old
      picnic haunts of mine, but Mr. Pollingray’s fresh delight in the landscape
      made them seem new and strange. Home through the valley.
    </p>
<p>
      The next day Miss Pollingray joined us, wearing a feutre gris and green
      plume, which looked exceedingly odd until you became accustomed to it. Her
      hair has decided gray streaks, and that, and the Queen Elizabeth nose, and
      the feutre gris!—but she is so kind, I could not even smile in my
      heart. It is singular that Mr. Pollingray, who’s but three years her
      junior, should look at least twenty years younger—at the very least.
      His moustache and beard are of the colour of a corn sheaf, and his blue
      eyes shining over them remind me of summer. That describes him. He is
      summer, and has not fallen into his autumn yet. Miss Pollingray helped me
      to talk a little. She tried to check her brother’s enthusiasm for our
      scenery, and extolled the French paysage. He laughed at her, for when they
      were in France it was she who used to say, ‘There is nothing here like
      England!’ Miss Fool rode between them attentive to the jingling of the
      bells in her cap: ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ at anybody’s command, in and out of
      season.
    </p>
<p>
      Thank you, Charles, for your letter! I was beginning to think my
      invitation to Dayton inexplicable, when that letter arrived. I cannot but
      deem it an unworthy baseness to entrap a girl to study her without a
      warning to her. I went up to my room after I had read it, and wrote in
      reply till the breakfast-bell rang. I resumed my occupation an hour later,
      and wrote till one o’clock. In all, fifteen pages of writing, which I
      carefully folded and addressed to Charles; sealed the envelope, stamped
      it, and destroyed it. I went to bed. ‘No, I won’t ride out to-day, I have
      a headache!’ I repeated this about half-a-dozen times to nobody’s knocking
      on the door, and when at last somebody knocked I tried to repeat it once,
      but having the message that Mr. Pollingray particularly wished to have my
      company in a ride, I rose submissively and cried. This humiliation made my
      temper ferocious. Mr. Pollingray observed my face, and put it down in his
      notebook. ‘A savage disposition,’ or, no, ‘An untamed little rebel’; for
      he has hopes of me. He had the cruelty to say so.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What I am, I shall remain,’ said I.
    </p>
<p>
      He informed me that it was perfectly natural for me to think it; and on my
      replying that persons ought to know themselves best: ‘At my age, perhaps,’ 
      he said, and added, ‘I cannot speak very confidently of my knowledge of
      myself.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you make us out to be nothing better than puppets, Mr. Pollingray.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If we have missed an early apprenticeship to the habit of self-command,
      ma filleule.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Merci, mon parrain.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He laughed. My French, I suppose.
    </p>
<p>
      I determined that, if he wanted to study me, I would help him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can command myself when I choose, but it is only when I choose.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      This seemed to me quite a reasonable speech, until I found him looking for
      something to follow, in explanation, and on coming to sift my meaning, I
      saw that it was temper, and getting more angry, continued:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The sort of young people who have such wonderful command of themselves
      are not the pleasantest.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ he said; ‘they disappoint us. We expect folly from the young.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I shut my lips. Prince Leboo knew that he must go, and a good gallop
      reconciled me to circumstances. Then I was put to jumping little furzes
      and ditches, which one cannot pretend to do without a fair appearance of
      gaiety; for, while you are running the risk of a tumble, you are compelled
      to look cheerful and gay, at least, I am. To fall frowning will never do.
      I had no fall. My gallant Leboo made my heart leap with love of him,
      though mill-stones were tied to it. I may be vexed when I begin, but I
      soon ride out a bad temper. And he is mine! I am certainly inconstant to
      Charles, for I think of Leboo fifty times more. Besides, there is no
      engagement as yet between Charles and me. I have first to be approved
      worthy by Mr. and Miss Pollingray: two pairs of eyes and ears, over which
      I see a solemnly downy owl sitting, conning their reports of me. It is a
      very unkind ordeal to subject any inexperienced young woman to. It was
      harshly conceived and it is being remorselessly executed. I would complain
      more loudly—in shrieks—if I could say I was unhappy; but every
      night I look out of my window before going to bed and see the long falls
      of the infant river through the meadow, and the dark woods seeming to
      enclose the house from harm: I dream of the old inhabitant, his ancestors,
      and the numbers and numbers of springs when the wildflowers have
      flourished in those woods and the nightingales have sung there. And I feel
      there will never be a home to me like Dayton.

<h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
<h3>
      HE
    </h3>
<p>
      For twenty years of my life I have embraced the phantom of the fairest
      woman that ever drew breath. I have submitted to her whims, I have
      worshipped her feet, I have, I believe, strengthened her principle. I have
      done all in my devotion but adopt her religious faith. And I have, as I
      trusted some time since, awakened to perceive that those twenty years were
      a period of mere sentimental pastime, perfectly useless, fruitless,
      unless, as is possible, it has saved me from other follies. But it was a
      folly in itself. Can one’s nature be too stedfast? The question whether a
      spice of frivolousness may not be a safeguard has often risen before me.
      The truth, I must learn to think, is, that my mental power is not the
      match for my ideal or sentimental apprehension and native tenacity of
      attachment. I have fallen into one of the pits of a well-meaning but idle
      man. The world discredits the existence of pure platonism in love. I
      myself can barely look back on those twenty years of amatory servility
      with a full comprehension of the part I have been playing in them. And yet
      I would not willingly forfeit the exalted admiration of Louise for my
      constancy: as little willingly as I would have imperilled her purity. I
      cling to the past as to something in which I have deserved well, though I
      am scarcely satisfied with it. According to our English notions I know my
      name. English notions, however, are not to be accepted in all matters, any
      more than the flat declaration of a fact will develop it in alt its
      bearings. When our English society shall have advanced to a high
      civilization, it will be less expansive in denouncing the higher
      stupidities. Among us, much of the social judgement of Bodge upon the
      relations of men to women is the stereotyped opinion of the land. There is
      the dictum here for a man who adores a woman who is possessed by a
      husband. If he has long adored her, and known himself to be preferred by
      her in innocency of heart; if he has solved the problem of being her
      bosom’s lord, without basely seeking to degrade her to being his mistress;
      the epithets to characterise him in our vernacular will probably be all
      the less flattering. Politically we are the most self-conscious people
      upon earth, and socially the frankest animals. The terrorism of our social
      laws is eminently serviceable, for without it such frank animals as we are
      might run into bad excesses. I judge rather by the abstract evidence than
      by the examples our fair matrons give to astounded foreigners when abroad.
    </p>
<p>
      Louise writes that her husband is paralysed. The Marquis de Mazardouin is
      at last tasting of his mortality. I bear in mind the day when he married
      her. She says that he has taken to priestly counsel, and, like a woman,
      she praises him for that. It is the one thing which I have not done to
      please her. She anticipates his decease. Should she be free—what
      then? My heart does not beat the faster for the thought. There are twenty
      years upon it, and they make a great load. But I have a desire that she
      should come over to us. The old folly might rescue me from the new one.
      Not that I am any further persecuted by the dread that I am in imminent
      danger here. I have established a proper mastery over my young lady. ‘Nous
      avons change de role’. Alice is subdued; she laughs feebly, is becoming
      conscious—a fact to be regretted, if I desired to check the
      creature’s growth. There is vast capacity in the girl. She has plainly not
      centred her affections upon Charles, so that a man’s conscience might be
      at ease if—if he chose to disregard what is due to decency. But,
      why, when I contest it, do I bow to the world’s opinion concerning
      disparity of years between husband and wife? I know innumerable cases of
      an old husband making a young wife happy. My friend, Dr. Galliot, married
      his ward, and he had the best wife of any man of my acquaintance. She has
      been publishing his learned manuscripts ever since his death. That is an
      extreme case, for he was forty-five years her senior, and stood bald at
      the altar. Old General Althorpe married Julia Dahoop, and, but for his
      preposterous jealousy of her, might be cited in proof that the ordinary
      reckonings are not to be a yoke on the neck of one who earnestly seeks to
      spouse a fitting mate, though late in life. But, what are fifty years?
      They mark the prime of a healthy man’s existence. He has by that time seen
      the world, can decide, and settle, and is virtually more eligible—to
      use the cant phrase of gossips—than a young man, even for a young
      girl. And may not some fair and fresh reward be justly claimed as the
      crown of a virtuous career?
    </p>
<p>
      I say all this, yet my real feeling is as if I were bald as Dr. Galliot
      and jealous as General Althorpe. For, with my thorough knowledge of
      myself, I, were I like either one of them, should not have offered myself
      to the mercy of a young woman, or of the world. Nor, as I am and know
      myself to be, would I offer myself to the mercy of Alice Amble. When my
      filleule first drove into Dayton she had some singularly audacious ideas
      of her own. Those vivid young feminine perceptions and untamed
      imaginations are desperate things to encounter. There is nothing beyond
      their reach. Our safety from them lies in the fact that they are always
      seeing too much, and imagining too wildly; so that, with a little help
      from us, they may be taught to distrust themselves; and when they have
      once distrusted themselves, we need not afterwards fear them: their
      supernatural vitality has vanished. I fancy my pretty Alice to be in this
      state now. She leaves us to-morrow. In the autumn we shall have her with
      us again, and Louise will scan her compassionately. I desire that they
      should meet. It will be hardly fair to the English girl, but, if I stand
      in the gap between them, I shall summon up no small quantity of dormant
      compatriotic feeling. The contemplation of the contrast, too, may save me
      from both: like the logic ass with the two trusses of hay on either side
      of him.

<h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<h3>
      SHE
    </h3>
<p>
      I am at home. There was never anybody who felt so strange in her home. It
      is not a month since I left my sisters, and I hardly remember that I know
      them. They all, and even papa, appear to be thinking about such petty
      things. They complain that I tell them nothing. What have I to tell? My
      Prince! my own Leboo, if I might lie in the stall with you, then I should
      feel thoroughly happy! That is, if I could fall asleep. Evelina declares
      we are not eight miles from Dayton. It seems to me I am eight millions of
      miles distant, and shall be all my life travelling along a weary road to
      get there again just for one long sunny day. And it might rain when I got
      there after all! My trouble nobody knows. Nobody knows a thing!
    </p>
<p>
      The night before my departure, Miss Pollingray did me the honour to
      accompany me up to my bedroom. She spoke to me searchingly about Charles;
      but she did not demand compromising answers. She is not in favour of early
      marriages, so she merely wishes to know the footing upon which we stand:
      that of friends. I assured her we were simply friends. ‘It is the firmest
      basis of an attachment,’ she said; and I did not look hurried.
    </p>
<p>
      But I gained my end. I led her to talk of the beautiful Marquise. This is
      the tale. Mr. Pollingray, when a very young man, and comparatively poor,
      went over to France with good introductions, and there saw and fell in
      love with Louise de Riverolles. She reciprocated his passion. If he would
      have consented to abjure his religion and worship with her, Madame de
      Riverolles, her mother, would have listened to her entreaties. But Gilbert
      was firm. Mr. Pollingray, I mean, refused to abandon his faith. Her
      mother, consequently, did not interfere, and Monsieur de Riverolles, her
      father, gave her to the Marquis de Marzardouin, a roue young nobleman,
      immensely rich, and shockingly dissipated. And she married him. No, I
      cannot understand French girls. Do as I will, it is quite incomprehensible
      to me how Louise, loving another, could suffer herself to be decked out in
      bridal finery and go to the altar and take the marriage oaths. Not if
      perdition had threatened would I have submitted. I have a feeling that Mr.
      Pollingray should have shown at least one year’s resentment at such
      conduct; and yet I admire him for his immediate generous forgiveness of
      her. It was fatherly. She was married at sixteen. His forgiveness was the
      fruit of his few years’ seniority, said Miss Pollingray, whose opinion of
      the Marquise I cannot arrive at. At any rate, they have been true and warm
      friends ever since, constantly together interchangeing visits. That is why
      Mr. Pollingray has been more French than English for those long years.
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Pollingray concluded by asking me what I thought of the story. I
      said: ‘It is very strange French habits are so different from ours. I dare
      say... I hope..., perhaps... indeed, Mr. Pollingray seems happy now.’ Her
      idea of my wits must be that they are of the schoolgirl order—a
      perfect receptacle for indefinite impressions.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said she. ‘Gilbert has burnt his heart to ashes by this time.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I slept with that sentence in my brain. In the morning, I rose and
      dressed, dreaming. As I was turning the handle of my door to go down to
      breakfast, suddenly I swung round in a fit of tears. It was so piteous to
      think that he should have waited by her twenty years in a slow anguish,
      his heart burning out, without a reproach or a complaint. I saw him, I
      still see him, like a martyr.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Some people,’ Miss Pollingray said, I permitted themselves to think evil
      of my brother’s assiduous devotion to a married woman. There is not a spot
      on his character, or on that of the person whom Gilbert loved.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      I would believe it in the teeth of calumny. I would cling to my belief in
      him if I were drowning.
    </p>
<p>
      I consider that those twenty years are just nothing, if he chooses to have
      them so. He has lived embalmed in a saintly affection. No wonder he
      considers himself still youthful. He is entitled to feel that his future
      is before him.
    </p>
<p>
      No amount of sponging would get the stains away from my horrid red
      eyelids. I slunk into my seat at the breakfast-table, not knowing that one
      of the maids had dropped a letter from Charles into my hand, and that I
      had opened it and was holding it open. The letter, as I found afterwards,
      told me that Charles has received an order from his uncle to go over to
      Mr. Pollingray’s estate in Dauphiny on business. I am not sorry that they
      should have supposed I was silly enough to cry at the thought of Charles’s
      crossing the Channel. They did imagine it, I know; for by and by Miss
      Pollingray whispered: ‘Les absents n’auront pas tort, cette fois,
      n’est-ce-pas? ‘And Mr. Pollingray was cruelly gentle: an air of ‘I would
      not intrude on such emotions’; and I heightened their delusions as much as
      I could: there was no other way of accounting for my pantomime face. Why
      should he fancy I suffered so terribly? He talked with an excited
      cheerfulness meant to relieve me, of course, but there was no
      justification for his deeming me a love-sick kind of woe-begone ballad
      girl. It caused him likewise to adopt a manner—what to call it, I
      cannot think: tender respect, frigid regard, anything that accompanies and
      belongs to the pressure of your hand with the finger-tips. He said goodbye
      so tenderly that I would have kissed his sleeve. The effort to restrain
      myself made me like an icicle. Oh! adieu, mon parrain!

              THE SENTIMENTALISTS

              AN UNFINISHED COMEDY
</pre>
<div class="play">
<p>
        The scene is a Surrey garden in early summer. The paths are shaded by
        tall box-wood hedges. The—time is some sixty years ago.
      </p>
<pre>
                 SCENE I

       PROFESSOR SPIRAL, DAME DRESDEN, LADY OLDLACE,
         VIRGINIA, WINIFRED, SWITHIN, and OSIER
</pre>
<p>
        (As they slowly promenade the garden, the professor is delivering one of
        his exquisite orations on Woman.)
      </p>
<p>
        SPIRAL: One husband! The woman consenting to marriage takes but one. For
        her there is no widowhood. That punctuation of the sentence called death
        is not the end of the chapter for her. It is the brilliant proof of her
        having a soul. So she exalts her sex. Above the wrangle and clamour of
        the passions she is a fixed star. After once recording her obedience to
        the laws of our common nature—that is to say, by descending once
        to wedlock—she passes on in sovereign disengagement—a
        dedicated widow.
      </p>
<pre>
   (By this time they have disappeared from view. HOMEWARE appears;
   he craftily avoids joining their party, like one who is unworthy of
   such noble oratory. He desires privacy and a book, but is disturbed
   by the arrival of ARDEN, who is painfully anxious to be polite to
   ‘her uncle Homeware.’)

                 SCENE II

               HOMEWARE, ARDEN
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: A glorious morning, sir.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: The sun is out, sir.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I am happy in meeting you, Mr. Homeware.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: I can direct you to the ladies, Mr. Arden. You will find them
        up yonder avenue.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: They are listening, I believe, to an oration from the mouth of
        Professor Spiral.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: On an Alpine flower which has descended to flourish on English
        soil. Professor Spiral calls it Nature’s ‘dedicated widow.’ 
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: ‘Dedicated widow’?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: The reference you will observe is to my niece Astraea.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: She is dedicated to whom?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: To her dead husband! You see the reverse of Astraea, says the
        professor, in those world-infamous widows who marry again.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Bah!
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Astraea, it is decided, must remain solitary, virgin cold,
        like the little Alpine flower. Professor Spiral has his theme.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: He will make much of it. May I venture to say that I prefer my
        present company?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: It is a singular choice. I can supply you with no weapons for
        the sort of stride in which young men are usually engaged. You belong to
        the camp you are avoiding.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Achilles was not the worse warrior, sir, for his probation in
        petticoats.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: His deeds proclaim it. But Alexander was the better chieftain
        until he drank with Lais.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: No, I do not plead guilty to Bacchus.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: You are confessing to the madder form of drunkenness.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: How, sir, I beg?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: How, when a young man sees the index to himself in everything
        spoken!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: That might have the look. I did rightly in coming to you, sir.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: ‘Her uncle Homeware’?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: You read through us all, sir.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: It may interest you to learn that you are the third of the
        gentlemen commissioned to consult the lady’s uncle Homeware.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: The third.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Yes, she is pursued. It could hardly be otherwise. Her
        attractions are acknowledged, and the house is not a convent. Yet, Mr.
        Arden, I must remind you that all of you are upon an enterprise held to
        be profane by the laws of this region. Can you again forget that Astraea
        is a widow?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: She was a wife two months; she has been a widow two years.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: The widow of the great and venerable Professor Towers is not
        to measure her widowhood by years. His, from the altar to the tomb. As
        it might be read, a one day’s walk!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Is she, in the pride of her youth, to be sacrificed to a
        whimsical feminine delicacy?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: You have argued it with her?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I have presumed.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: And still she refused her hand!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: She commended me to you, sir. She has a sound judgement of
        persons.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: I should put it that she passes the Commissioners of Lunacy,
        on the ground of her being a humorous damsel. Your predecessors had also
        argued it with her; and they, too, discovered their enemy in a whimsical
        feminine delicacy. Where is the difference between you? Evidently she
        cannot perceive it, and I have to seek: You will have had many
        conversations with Astraea?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I can say, that I am thrice the man I was before I had them.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: You have gained in manhood from conversations with a widow in
        her twenty-second year; and you want more of her.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: As much as I want more wisdom.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: You would call her your Muse?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: So prosaic a creature as I would not dare to call her that.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: You have the timely mantle of modesty, Mr. Arden. She has
        prepared you for some of the tests with her uncle Homeware.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: She warned me to be myself, without a spice of affectation.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: No harder task could be set a young man in modern days. Oh,
        the humorous damsel. You sketch me the dimple at her mouth.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Frankly, sir, I wish you to know me better; and I think I can
        bear inspection. Astraea sent me to hear the reasons why she refuses me
        a hearing.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Her reason, I repeat, is this; to her idea, a second wedlock
        is unholy. Further, it passes me to explain. The young lady lands us
        where we were at the beginning; such must have been her humorous
        intention.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: What can I do?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Love and war have been compared. Both require strategy and
        tactics, according to my recollection of the campaign.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I will take to heart what you say, sir.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Take it to head. There must be occasional descent of lovers’ 
        heads from the clouds. And Professor Spiral,—But here we have a
        belated breeze of skirts.
      </p>
<pre>
   (The reference is to the arrival of LYRA, breathless.)

                SCENE III

             HOMEWARE, ARDEN, LYRA
</pre>
<p>
        LYRA: My own dear uncle Homeware!
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: But where is Pluriel?
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Where is a woman’s husband when she is away from him?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: In Purgatory, by the proper reckoning. But hurry up the
        avenue, or you will be late for Professor Spiral’s address.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I know it all without hearing. Their Spiral! Ah, Mr. Arden! You
        have not chosen badly. The greater my experience, the more do I value my
        uncle Homeware’s company.
      </p>
<pre>
   (She is affectionate to excess but has a roguish eye withal, as of
   one who knows that uncle Homeware suspects all young men and most
   young women.)
</pre>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Agree with the lady promptly, my friend.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I would gladly boast of so lengthened an experience, Lady
        Pluriel.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I must have a talk with Astraea, my dear uncle. Her letters breed
        suspicions. She writes feverishly. The last one hints at service on the
        West Coast of Africa.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: For the draining of a pestiferous land, or an enlightenment of
        the benighted black, we could not despatch a missionary more effective
        than the handsomest widow in Great Britain.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Have you not seen signs of disturbance?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: A great oration may be a sedative.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I have my suspicions.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Mr. Arden, I could counsel you to throw yourself at Lady
        Pluriel’s feet, and institute her as your confessional priest.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Madam, I am at your feet. I am devoted to the lady.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Devoted. There cannot be an objection. It signifies that a man
        asks for nothing in return!
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Have a thought upon your words with this lady, Mr. Arden!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Devoted, I said. I am. I would give my life for her.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Expecting it to be taken to-morrow or next day? Accept my
        encomiums. A male devotee is within an inch of a miracle. Women had been
        looking for this model for ages, uncle.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: You are the model, Mr Arden!
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Can you have intended to say that it is in view of marriage you
        are devoted to the widow of Professor Towers?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: My one view.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: It is a star you are beseeching to descend.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: It is.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: You disappoint me hugely. You are of the ordinary tribe after all;
        and your devotion craves an enormous exchange, infinitely surpassing the
        amount you bestow.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: It does. She is rich in gifts; I am poor. But I give all I have.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: These lovers, uncle Homeware!
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: A honey-bag is hung up and we have them about us. They would
        persuade us that the chief business of the world is a march to the
        altar.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: With the right partner, if the business of the world is to be
        better done.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Which right partner has been chosen on her part, by a veiled
        woman, who marches back from the altar to discover that she has chained
        herself to the skeleton of an idea, or is in charge of that devouring
        tyrant, an uxorious husband. Is Mr. Arden in favour with the Dame,
        uncle?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: My sister is an unsuspicious potentate, as you know.
        Pretenders to the hand of an inviolate widow bite like waves at a rock.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Professor Spiral advances rapidly.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Not, it would appear, when he has his audience of ladies and
        their satellites.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I am sure I hear a spring-tide of enthusiasm coming.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I will see.
      </p>
<pre>
   (He goes up the path.)
</pre>
<p>
        LYRA: Now! my own dear uncle, save me from Pluriel. I have given him the
        slip in sheer desperation; but the man is at his shrewdest when he is
        left to guess at my heels. Tell him I am anywhere but here. Tell him I
        ran away to get a sense of freshness in seeing him again. Let me have
        one day of liberty, or, upon my word, I shall do deeds; I shall console
        young Arden: I shall fly to Paris and set my cap at presidents and
        foreign princes. Anything rather than be eaten up every minute, as I am.
        May no woman of my acquaintance marry a man of twenty years her senior!
        She marries a gigantic limpet. At that period of his life a man becomes
        too voraciously constant.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Cupid clipped of wing is a destructive parasite.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I am in dead earnest, uncle, and I will have a respite, or else
        let decorum beware!
      </p>
<pre>
   (Arden returns.)
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: The ladies are on their way.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I must get Astraea to myself.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: My library is a virgin fortress, Mr. Arden. Its gates are open
        to you on other topics than the coupling of inebriates.
      </p>
<pre>
   (He enters the house—LYRA disappears in the garden—Spiral’s
   audience reappear without him.)

                 SCENE IV

       DAME DRESDEN, LADY OLDLACE, VIRGINIA, WINIFRED,
             ARDEN, SWITHIN, OSIER
</pre>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: Such perfect rhythm!
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: Such oratory!
      </p>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: A master hand. I was in a trance from the first sentence
        to the impressive close.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: Such oratory is a whole orchestral symphony.
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: Such command of intonation and subject!
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: That resonant voice!
      </p>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: Swithin, his flow of eloquence! He launched forth!
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: Like an eagle from a cliff.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: The measure of the words was like a beat of wings.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: He makes poets of us.
      </p>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: Spiral achieved his pinnacle to-day!
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: How treacherous is our memory when we have most the longing to
        recall great sayings!
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: True, I conceive that my notes will be precious.
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: You could take notes!
      </p>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: It seems a device for missing the quintessential.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: Scraps of the body to the loss of the soul of it. We can allow
        that our friend performed good menial service.
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: I could not have done the thing.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: In truth; it does remind one of the mess of pottage.
      </p>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: One hardly felt one breathed.
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: I confess it moved me to tears.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: There is a pathos for us in the display of perfection. Such
        subtle contrast with our individual poverty affects us.
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: Surely there were passages of a distinct and most exquisite
        pathos.
      </p>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: As in all great oratory! The key of it is the pathos.
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: In great oratory, great poetry, great fiction; you try it by
        the pathos. All our critics agree in stipulating for the pathos. My
        tears were no feminine weakness, I could not be a discordant instrument.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: I must make confession. He played on me too.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: We shall be sensible for long of that vibration from the touch of
        a master hand.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: An accomplished player can make a toy-shop fiddle sound you a
        Stradivarius.
      </p>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: Have you a right to a remark, Mr. Arden? What could have
        detained you?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Ah, Dame. It may have been a warning that I am a discordant
        instrument. I do not readily vibrate.
      </p>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: A discordant instrument is out of place in any civil
        society. You have lost what cannot be recovered.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: There are the notes.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: Yes, the notes.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: You can be satisfied with the dog’s feast at the table, Mr.
        Arden!
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: Ha!
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: Never have I seen Astraea look sublimer in her beauty than
        with her eyes uplifted to the impassioned speaker, reflecting every
        variation of his tones.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Astraea!
      </p>
<p>
        LADY OLDLACE: She was entranced when he spoke of woman descending from
        her ideal to the gross reality of man.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: Yes, yes. I have the words [reads]: ‘Woman is to the front of
        man, holding the vestal flower of a purer civilization. I see,’ he says,
        ‘the little taper in her hands transparent round the light, against
        rough winds.’ 
      </p>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: And of Astraea herself, what were the words? ‘Nature’s
        dedicated widow.’ 
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: Vestal widow, was it not?
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: Maiden widow, I think.
      </p>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: We decide for ‘dedicated.’ 
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: Spiral paid his most happy tribute to the memory of her late
        husband, the renowned Professor Towers.
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: But his look was at dear Astraea.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: At Astraea? Why?
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: For her sanction doubtless.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Ha!
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: He said his pride would ever be in his being received as the
        successor of Professor Towers.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Successor!
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: Guardian was it not?
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: Tutor. I think he said.
      </p>
<pre>
   (The three gentlemen consult Osier’s notes uneasily.)
</pre>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: Our professor must by this time have received in full
        Astraea’s congratulations, and Lyra is hearing from her what it is to be
        too late. You will join us at the luncheon table, if you do not feel
        yourself a discordant instrument there, Mr. Arden?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN (going to her): The allusion to knife and fork tunes my strings
        instantly, Dame.
      </p>
<p>
        DAME DRESDEN: You must help me to-day, for the professor will be tired,
        though we dare not hint at it in his presence. No reference, ladies, to
        the great speech we have been privileged to hear; we have expressed our
        appreciation and he could hardly bear it.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Nothing is more distasteful to the orator!
      </p>
<p>
        VIRGINIA: As with every true genius, he is driven to feel humbly human
        by the exultation of him.
      </p>
<p>
        SWITHIN: He breathes in a rarified air.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: I was thrilled, I caught at passing beauties. I see that here and
        there I have jotted down incoherencies, lines have seduced me, so that I
        missed the sequence—the precious part. Ladies, permit me to rank
        him with Plato as to the equality of women and men.
      </p>
<p>
        WINIFRED: It is nobly said.
      </p>
<p>
        OSIER: And with the Stoics, in regard to celibacy.
      </p>
<pre>
   (By this time all the ladies have gone into the house.)
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: Successor! Was the word successor?
      </p>
<pre>
   (ARDEN, SWITHIN, and OSIER are excitedly searching the notes
   when SPIRAL passes and strolls into the house. His air of
   self-satisfaction increases their uneasiness they follow him.
   ASTRAEA and LYRA come down the path.)

                 SCENE V

               ASTRAEA, LYRA
</pre>
<p>
        LYRA: Oh! Pluriel, ask me of him! I wish I were less sure he would not
        be at the next corner I turn.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: You speak of your husband strangely, Lyra.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: My head is out of a sack. I managed my escape from him this
        morning by renouncing bath and breakfast; and what a relief, to be in
        the railway carriage alone! that is, when the engine snorted. And if I
        set eyes on him within a week, he will hear some truths. His idea of
        marriage is, the taking of the woman into custody. My hat is on, and on
        goes Pluriel’s. My foot on the stairs; I hear his boot behind me. In my
        boudoir I am alone one minute, and then the door opens to the
        inevitable. I pay a visit, he is passing the house as I leave it. He
        will not even affect surprise. I belong to him, I am cat’s mouse. And he
        will look doating on me in public. And when I speak to anybody, he is
        that fearful picture of all smirks. Fling off a kid glove after a round
        of calls; feel your hand—there you have me now that I am out of
        him for my half a day, if for as long.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: This is one of the world’s happy marriages!
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: This is one of the world’s choice dishes! And I have it planted
        under my nostrils eternally. Spare me the mention of Pluriel until he
        appears; that’s too certain this very day. Oh! good husband! good kind
        of man! whatever you please; only some peace, I do pray, for the
        husband-haunted wife. I like him, I like him, of course, but I want to
        breathe. Why, an English boy perpetually bowled by a Christmas pudding
        would come to loathe the mess.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: His is surely the excess of a merit.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Excess is a poison. Excess of a merit is a capital offence in
        morality. It disgusts, us with virtue. And you are the cunningest of
        fencers, tongue, or foils. You lead me to talk of myself, and I hate the
        subject. By the way, you have practised with Mr. Arden.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: A tiresome instructor, who lets you pass his guard to
        compliment you on a hit.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: He rather wins me.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: He does at first.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Begins Plurielizing, without the law to back him, does he?
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: The fencing lessons are at an end.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: The duetts with Mr. Swithin’s violoncello continue?
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: He broke through the melody.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: There were readings in poetry with Mr. Osier, I recollect.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: His own compositions became obtrusive.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: No fencing, no music, no poetry! no West Coast of Africa either, I
        suppose.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Very well! I am on my defence. You at least shall not
        misunderstand me, Lyra. One intense regret I have; that I did not live
        in the time of the Amazons. They were free from this question of
        marriage; this babble of love. Why am I so persecuted? He will not take
        a refusal. There are sacred reasons. I am supported by every woman
        having the sense of her dignity. I am perverted, burlesqued by the fury
        of wrath I feel at their incessant pursuit. And I despise Mr. Osier and
        Mr. Swithin because they have an air of pious agreement with the Dame,
        and are conspirators behind their mask.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: False, false men!
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: They come to me. I am complimented on being the vulnerable
        spot.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: The object desired is usually addressed by suitors, my poor
        Astraea!
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: With the assumption, that as I am feminine I must necessarily
        be in the folds of the horrible constrictor they call Love, and that I
        leap to the thoughts of their debasing marriage.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: One of them goes to Mr. Homeware.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: All are sent to him in turn. He can dispose of them.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Now that is really masterly fun, my dear; most creditable to you!
        Love, marriage, a troop of suitors, and uncle Homeware. No, it would not
        have occurred to me, and—I am considered to have some humour. Of
        course, he disposes of them. He seemed to have a fairly favourable
        opinion of Mr. Arden.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: I do not share it. He is the least respectful of the sentiments
        entertained by me. Pray, spare me the mention of him, as you say of your
        husband. He has that pitiful conceit in men, which sets them thinking
        that a woman must needs be susceptible to the declaration of the mere
        existence of their passion. He is past argument. Impossible for him to
        conceive a woman’s having a mind above the conditions of her sex. A
        woman, according to him, can have no ideal of life, except as a ball to
        toss in the air and catch in a cup. Put him aside.... We creatures are
        doomed to marriage, and if we shun it, we are a kind of cripple. He is
        grossly earthy in his view of us. We are unable to move a step in
        thought or act unless we submit to have a husband. That is his
        reasoning. Nature! Nature! I have to hear of Nature! We must be above
        Nature, I tell him, or, we shall be very much below. He is ranked among
        our clever young men; and he can be amusing. So far he passes muster;
        and he has a pleasant voice. I dare say he is an uncle Homeware’s good
        sort of boy. Girls like him. Why does he not fix his attention upon one
        of them; Why upon me? We waste our time in talking of him.... The secret
        of it is, that he has no reverence. The marriage he vaunts is a mere
        convenient arrangement for two to live together under command of nature.
        Reverence for the state of marriage is unknown to him. How explain my
        feeling? I am driven into silence. Cease to speak of him.... He is the
        dupe of his eloquence—his passion, he calls it. I have only to
        trust myself to him, and—I shall be one of the world’s married
        women! Words are useless. How am I to make him see that it is I who
        respect the state of marriage by refusing; not he by perpetually
        soliciting. Once married, married for ever. Widow is but a term. When
        women hold their own against him, as I have done, they will be more
        esteemed. I have resisted and conquered. I am sorry I do not share in
        the opinion of your favourite.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Mine?
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: You spoke warmly of him.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Warmly, was it?
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: You are not blamed, my dear: he has a winning manner.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I take him to be a manly young fellow, smart enough; handsome too.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Oh, he has good looks.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: And a head, by repute.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: For the world’s work, yes.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Not romantic.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Romantic ideas are for dreamy simperers.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Amazons repudiate them.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Laugh at me. Half my time I am laughing at myself. I should
        regain my pride if I could be resolved on a step. I am strong to resist;
        I have not strength to move.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: I see the sphinx of Egypt!
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: And all the while I am a manufactory of gunpowder in this quiet
        old-world Sabbath circle of dear good souls, with their stereotyped
        interjections, and orchestra of enthusiasms; their tapering delicacies:
        the rejoicing they have in their common agreement on all created things.
        To them it is restful. It spurs me to fly from rooms and chairs and beds
        and houses. I sleep hardly a couple of hours. Then into the early
        morning air, out with the birds; I know no other pleasure.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Hospital work for a variation: civil or military. The former
        involves the house-surgeon: the latter the grateful lieutenant.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Not if a woman can resist... I go to it proof-armoured.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: What does the Dame say?
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Sighs over me! Just a little maddening to hear.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: When we feel we have the strength of giants, and are bidden to sit
        and smile! You should rap out some of our old sweet-innocent garden
        oaths with her—‘Carnation! Dame!’ That used to make her dance on
        her seat.—‘But, dearest Dame, it is as natural an impulse for
        women to have that relief as for men; and natural will out, begonia! it
        will!’ We ran through the book of Botany for devilish objurgations. I do
        believe our misconduct caused us to be handed to the good man at the
        altar as the right corrective. And you were the worst offender.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Was I? I could be now, though I am so changed a creature.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: You enjoy the studies with your Spiral, come!
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Professor Spiral is the one honest gentleman here. He does
        homage to my principles. I have never been troubled by him: no silly
        hints or side-looks—you know, the dog at the forbidden bone.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: A grand orator.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: He is. You fix on the smallest of his gifts. He is
        intellectually and morally superior.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: Praise of that kind makes me rather incline to prefer his
        inferiors. He fed gobble-gobble on your puffs of incense. I coughed and
        scraped the gravel; quite in vain; he tapped for more and more.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Professor Spiral is a thinker; he is a sage. He gives women
        their due.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: And he is a bachelor too—or consequently.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: If you like you may be as playful with me as the Lyra of our
        maiden days used to be. My dear, my dear, how glad I am to have you
        here! You remind me that I once had a heart. It will beat again with you
        beside me, and I shall look to you for protection. A novel request from
        me. From annoyance, I mean. It has entirely altered my character.
        Sometimes I am afraid to think of what I was, lest I should suddenly
        romp, and perform pirouettes and cry ‘Carnation!’ There is the bell. We
        must not be late when the professor condescends to sit for meals.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: That rings healthily in the professor.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Arm in arm, my Lyra.
      </p>
<p>
        LYRA: No Pluriel yet!
      </p>
<pre>
   (They enter the house, and the time changes to evening of the same
   day. The scene is still the garden.)

                 SCENE VI

               ASTRAEA, ARDEN
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Pardon me if I do not hear you well.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: I will not even think you barbarous.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: I am. I am the object of the chase.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: The huntsman draws the wood, then, and not you.
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        At any instant I am forced to run,
        Or turn in my defence: how can I be
        Other than barbarous? You are the cause.
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: No: heaven that made you beautiful’s the cause.
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        Say, earth, that gave you instincts. Bring me down
        To instincts! When by chance I speak awhile
        With our professor, you appear in haste,
        Full cry to sight again the missing hare.
        Away ideas! All that’s divinest flies!
        I have to bear in mind how young you are.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:        You have only to look up to me four years,
        Instead of forty!
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Sir?
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN          There’s my misfortune!
        And worse that, young, I love as a young man.
        Could I but quench the fire, I might conceal
        The youthfulness offending you so much.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: I wish you would. I wish it earnestly.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Impossible. I burn.
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: You should not burn.
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN        ‘Tis more than I. ‘Tis fire. It masters will.
        You would not say I should not’ if you knew fire.
        It seizes. It devours.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Dry wood.
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:        Cold wit!
        How cold you can be! But be cold, for sweet
        You must be. And your eyes are mine: with them
        I see myself: unworthy to usurp
        The place I hold a moment. While I look
        I have my happiness.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: You should look higher.
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:        Through you to the highest. Only through you!
          Through you
        The mark I may attain is visible,
        And I have strength to dream of winning it.
        You are the bow that speeds the arrow: you
        The glass that brings the distance nigh. My world
        Is luminous through you, pure heavenly,
        But hangs upon the rose’s outer leaf,
        Not next her heart. Astraea! my own beloved!
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: We may be excellent friends. And I have faults.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Name them: I am hungering for more to love.
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        I waver very constantly: I have
        No fixity of feeling or of sight.
        I have no courage: I can often dream
        Of daring: when I wake I am in dread.
        I am inconstant as a butterfly,
        And shallow as a brook with little fish!
        Strange little fish, that tempt the small boy’s net,
        But at a touch straight dive! I am any one’s,
        And no one’s! I am vain.
        Praise of my beauty lodges in my ears.
        The lark reels up with it; the nightingale
        Sobs bleeding; the flowers nod; I could believe
        A poet, though he praised me to my face.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:        Never had poet so divine a fount
        To drink of!
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Have I given you more to love
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:        More! You have given me your inner mind,
        Where conscience in the robes of Justice shoots
        Light so serenely keen that in such light
        Fair infants, I newly criminal of earth,’ 
        As your friend Osier says, might show some blot.
        Seraphs might! More to love? Oh! these dear faults
        Lead you to me like troops of laughing girls
        With garlands. All the fear is, that you trifle,
        Feigning them.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: For what purpose?
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Can I guess? ASTRAEA:
      </p>
<pre>
        I think ‘tis you who have the trifler’s note.
        My hearing is acute, and when you speak,
        Two voices ring, though you speak fervidly.
        Your Osier quotation jars. Beware!
        Why were you absent from our meeting-place
        This morning?
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:          I was on the way, and met
        Your uncle Homeware
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Ah!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: He loves you.
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        He loves me: he has never understood.
        He loves me as a creature of the flock;
        A little whiter than some others.
        Yes; He loves me, as men love; not to uplift;
        Not to have faith in; not to spiritualize.
        For him I am a woman and a widow
        One of the flock, unmarked save by a brand.
        He said it!—You confess it! You have learnt
        To share his error, erring fatally.
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: By whose advice went I to him?
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:               By whose?
        Pursuit that seemed incessant: persecution.
        Besides, I have changed since then: I change; I change;
        It is too true I change. I could esteem
        You better did you change. And had you heard
        The noble words this morning from the mouth
        Of our professor, changed were you, or raised
        Above love-thoughts, love-talk, and flame and flutter,
        High as eternal snows. What said he else,
        My uncle Homeware?
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:             That you were not free:
        And that he counselled us to use our wits.
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        But I am free I free to be ever free!
        My freedom keeps me free! He counselled us?
        I am not one in a conspiracy.
        I scheme no discord with my present life.
        Who does, I cannot look on as my friend.
        Not free? You know me little. Were I chained,
        For liberty I would sell liberty
        To him who helped me to an hour’s release.
        But having perfect freedom...
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: No.
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        Good sir,
        You check me?
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: Perfect freedom?
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Perfect!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: No!
      </p>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Am I awake? What blinds me?
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:                  Filaments
        The slenderest ever woven about a brain
        From the brain’s mists, by the little sprite called
          Fancy.
        A breath would scatter them; but that one breath
        Must come of animation. When the heart
        Is as, a frozen sea the brain spins webs.
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        ‘Tis very singular!
        I understand.
        You translate cleverly. I hear in verse
        My uncle Homeware’s prose. He has these notions.
        Old men presume to read us.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:        Young men may.
        You gaze on an ideal reflecting you
        Need I say beautiful? Yet it reflects
        Less beauty than the lady whom I love
        Breathes, radiates. Look on yourself in me.
        What harm in gazing? You are this flower
        You are that spirit. But the spirit fed
        With substance of the flower takes all its bloom!
        And where in spirits is the bloom of the flower?
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        ‘Tis very singular. You have a tone
        Quite changed.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:        You wished a change. To show you, how
        I read you...
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        Oh! no, no. It means dissection.
        I never heard of reading character
        That did not mean dissection. Spare me that.
        I am wilful, violent, capricious, weak,
        Wound in a web of my own spinning-wheel,
        A star-gazer, a riband in the wind...
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:        A banner in the wind! and me you lead,
        And shall! At least, I follow till I win.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Forbear, I do beseech you.
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:               I have had
        Your hand in mine.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Once.
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:               Once!
        Once! ‘twas; once, was the heart alive,
        Leaping to break the ice. Oh! once, was aye
        That laughed at frosty May like spring’s return.
        Say you are terrorized: you dare not melt.
        You like me; you might love me; but to dare,
        Tasks more than courage. Veneration, friends,
        Self-worship, which is often self-distrust,
        Bar the good way to you, and make a dream
        A fortress and a prison.
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:               Changed! you have changed
        Indeed. When you so boldly seized my hand
        It seemed a boyish freak, done boyishly.
        I wondered at Professor Spiral’s choice
        Of you for an example, and our hope.
        Now you grow dangerous. You must have thought,
        And some things true you speak-save ‘terrorized.’ 
        It may be flattering to sweet self-love
        To deem me terrorized.—‘Tis my own soul,
        My heart, my mind, all that I hold most sacred,
        Not fear of others, bids me walk aloof.
        Who terrorizes me? Who could? Friends? Never!
        The world? as little. Terrorized!
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: Forgive me.
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        I might reply, Respect me. If I loved,
        If I could be so faithless as to love,
        Think you I would not rather noise abroad
        My shame for penitence than let friends dwell
        Deluded by an image of one vowed
        To superhuman, who the common mock
        Of things too human has at heart become.
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: You would declare your love?
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:               I said, my shame.
        The woman that’s the widow is ensnared,
        Caught in the toils! away with widows!—Oh!
        I hear men shouting it.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:        But shame there’s none
        For me in loving: therefore I may take
        Your friends to witness? tell them that my pride
        Is in the love of you?
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:               ‘Twill soon bring
        The silence that should be between us two,
        And sooner give me peace.
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: And you consent?
      </p>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        For the sake of peace and silence I consent,
        You should be warned that you will cruelly
        Disturb them. But ‘tis best. You should be warned
        Your pleading will be hopeless. But ‘tis best.
        You have my full consent. Weigh well your acts,
        You cannot rest where you have cast this bolt
        Lay that to heart, and you are cherished, prized,
        Among them: they are estimable ladies,
        Warmest of friends; though you may think they soar
        Too loftily for your measure of strict sense
        (And as my uncle Homeware’s pupil, sir,
        In worldliness, you do), just minds they have:
        Once know them, and your banishment will fret.
        I would not run such risks. You will offend,
        Go near to outrage them; and perturbate
        As they have not deserved of you. But I,
        Considering I am nothing in the scales
        You balance, quite and of necessity
        Consent. When you have weighed it, let me hear.
        My uncle Homeware steps this way in haste.
        We have been talking long, and in full view!

                SCENE VII

             ASTRAEA, ARDEN, HOMEWARE
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:        Astraea, child! You, Arden, stand aside.
        Ay, if she were a maid you might speak first,
        But being a widow she must find her tongue.
        Astraea, they await you. State the fact
        As soon as you are questioned, fearlessly.
        Open the battle with artillery.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: What is the matter, uncle Homeware?
      </p>
<pre>
HOMEWARE (playing fox):                  What?
        Why, we have watched your nice preliminaries
        From the windows half the evening. Now run in.
        Their patience has run out, and, as I said,
        Unlimber and deliver fire at once.
        Your aunts Virginia and Winifred,
        With Lady Oldlace, are the senators,
        The Dame for Dogs. They wear terrific brows,
        But be not you affrighted, my sweet chick,
        And tell them uncle Homeware backs your choice,
        By lawyer and by priests! by altar, fount,
        And testament!
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: My choice! what have I chosen?
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: She asks? You hear her, Arden?—what and whom!
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Surely, sir!... heavens! have you...
      </p>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:                  Surely the old fox,
        In all I have read, is wiser than the young:
        And if there is a game for fox to play,
        Old fox plays cunningest.
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:        Why fox? Oh! uncle,
        You make my heart beat with your mystery;
        I never did love riddles. Why sit they
        Awaiting me, and looking terrible?
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:        It is reported of an ancient folk
        Which worshipped idols, that upon a day
        Their idol pitched before them on the floor
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Was ever so ridiculous a tale!
      </p>
<pre>
HOMEWARE        To call the attendant fires to account
        Their elders forthwith sat...
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:                  Is there no prayer
        Will move you, uncle Homeware?
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:               God-daughter,
        This gentleman for you I have proposed
        As husband.
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Arden! we are lost.
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:                  Astraea!
        Support him! Though I knew not his design,
        It plants me in mid-heaven. Would it were
        Not you, but I to bear the shock. My love!
        We lost, you cry; you join me with you lost!
        The truth leaps from your heart: and let it shine
        To light us on our brilliant battle day
        And victory
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Who betrayed me!
      </p>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:               Who betrayed?
        Your voice, your eyes, your veil, your knife and fork;
        Your tenfold worship of your widowhood;
        As he who sees he must yield up the flag,
        Hugs it oath-swearingly! straw-drowningly.
        To be reasonable: you sent this gentleman
        Referring him to me....
</pre>
<pre>
ASTRAEA:                    And that is false.
        All’s false. You have conspired. I am disgraced.
        But you will learn you have judged erroneously.
        I am not the frail creature you conceive.
        Between your vision of life’s aim, and theirs
        Who presently will question me, I cling
        To theirs as light: and yours I deem a den
        Where souls can have no growth.
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:        But when we touched
        The point of hand-pressings, ‘twas rightly time
        To think of wedding ties?
</pre>
<p>
        ASTRAEA: Arden, adieu!
      </p>
<pre>
          (She rushes into house.)

                SCENE VIII

               ARDEN, HOMEWARE
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: Adieu! she said. With her that word is final.
      </p>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:        Strange! how young people blowing words like clouds
        On winds, now fair, now foul, and as they please
        Should still attach the Fates to them.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:               She’s wounded
        Wounded to the quick!
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:             The quicker our success: for short
        Of that, these dames, who feel for everything,
        Feel nothing.
</pre>
<pre>
ARDEN:             Your intention has been kind,
        Dear sir, but you have ruined me.
</pre>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Good-night. (Going.)
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: Yet she said, we are lost, in her surprise.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Good morning. (Returning.)
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:             I suppose that I am bound
        (If I could see for what I should be glad!)
        To thank you, sir.
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:             Look hard but give no thanks.
        I found my girl descending on the road
        Of breakneck coquetry, and barred her way.
        Either she leaps the bar, or she must back.
        That means she marries you, or says good-bye.
                    (Going again.)
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: Now she’s among them. (Looking at window.)
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: Now she sees her mind.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: It is my destiny she now decides!
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: There’s now suspense on earth and round the spheres.
      </p>
<p>
        ARDEN: She’s mine now: mine! or I am doomed to go.
      </p>
<p>
        HOMEWARE: The marriage ring, or the portmanteau now!
      </p>
<pre>
ARDEN:        Laugh as you like, air! I am not ashamed
        To love and own it.
</pre>
<pre>
HOMEWARE:        So the symptoms show.
        Rightly, young man, and proving a good breed.
        To further it’s a duty to mankind
        And I have lent my push, But recollect:
        Old Ilion was not conquered in a day.
                  (He enters house.)
</pre>
<p>
        ARDEN: Ten years! If I may win her at the end!

<h2>
      INTRODUCTION TO W. M. THACKERAY’S “THE FOUR GEORGES”
     </h2>
<p>
      WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY was born at Calcutta, July 18, 1811, the only
      child of Richmond and Anne Thackeray. He received the main part of his
      education at the Charterhouse, as we know to our profit. Thence he passed
      to Cambridge, remaining there from February 1829 to sometime in 1830. To
      judge by quotations and allusions, his favourite of the classics was
      Horace, the chosen of the eighteenth century, and generally the voice of
      its philosophy in a prosperous country. His voyage from India gave him
      sight of Napoleon on the rocky island. In his young manhood he made his
      bow reverentially to Goethe of Weimar; which did not check his hand from
      setting its mark on the sickliness of Werther.
    </p>
<p>
      He was built of an extremely impressionable nature and a commanding good
      sense. He was in addition a calm observer, having ‘the harvest of a quiet
      eye.’ Of this combination with the flood of subjects brought up to
      judgement in his mind, came the prevalent humour, the enforced disposition
      to satire, the singular critical drollery, notable in his works. His
      parodies, even those pushed to burlesque, are an expression of criticism
      and are more effective than the serious method, while they rarely overstep
      the line of justness. The Novels by Eminent Hands do not pervert the
      originals they exaggerate. ‘Sieyes an abbe, now a ferocious
      lifeguardsman,’ stretches the face of the rollicking Irish novelist
      without disfeaturing him; and the mysterious visitor to the palatial
      mansion in Holywell Street indicates possibilities in the Oriental
      imagination of the eminent statesman who stooped to conquer fact through
      fiction. Thackeray’s attitude in his great novels is that of the
      composedly urbane lecturer, on a level with a select audience, assured of
      interesting, above requirements to excite. The slow movement of the
      narrative has a grace of style to charm like the dance of the Minuet de la
      Cour: it is the limpidity of Addison flavoured with salt of a racy
      vernacular; and such is the veri-similitude and the dialogue that they
      might seem to be heard from the mouths of living speakers. When in this
      way the characters of Vanity Fair had come to growth, their author was
      rightly appreciated as one of the creators in our literature, he took at
      once the place he will retain. With this great book and with Esmond and
      The Newcomes, he gave a name eminent, singular, and beloved to English
      fiction.
    </p>
<p>
      Charges of cynicism are common against all satirists, Thackeray had to
      bear with them. The social world he looked at did not show him heroes,
      only here and there a plain good soul to whom he was affectionate in the
      unhysterical way of an English father patting a son on the head. He
      described his world as an accurate observer saw it, he could not be
      dishonest. Not a page of his books reveals malevolence or a sneer at
      humanity. He was driven to the satirical task by the scenes about him.
      There must be the moralist in the satirist if satire is to strike. The
      stroke is weakened and art violated when he comes to the front. But he
      will always be pressing forward, and Thackeray restrained him as much as
      could be done, in the manner of a good-humoured constable. Thackeray may
      have appeared cynical to the devout by keeping him from a station in the
      pulpit among congregations of the many convicted sinners. That the
      moralist would have occupied it and thundered had he presented us with the
      Fourth of the Georges we see when we read of his rejecting the
      solicitations of so seductive a personage for the satiric rod.
    </p>
<p>
      Himself one of the manliest, the kindliest of human creatures, it was the
      love of his art that exposed him to misinterpretation. He did stout
      service in his day. If the bad manners he scourged are now lessened to
      some degree we pay a debt in remembering that we owe much to him, and if
      what appears incurable remains with us, a continued reading of his works
      will at least help to combat it.

      A PAUSE IN THE STRIFE—1886
    </h2>
<p>
      Our ‘Eriniad,’ or ballad epic of the enfranchisement of the sister island
      is closing its first fytte for the singer, and with such result as those
      Englishmen who have some knowledge of their fellows foresaw. There are
      sufficient reasons why the Tories should always be able to keep together,
      but let them have the credit of cohesiveness and subordination to control.
      Though working for their own ends, they won the esteem of their allies,
      which will count for them in the struggles to follow. Their leaders appear
      to have seen what has not been distinctly perceptible to the opposite
      party—that the break up of the Liberals means the defection of the
      old Whigs in permanence, heralding the establishment of a powerful force
      against Radicalism, with a capital cry to the country. They have tactical
      astuteness. If they seem rather too proud of their victory, it is merely
      because, as becomes them, they do not look ahead. To rejoice in the
      gaining of a day, without having clear views of the morrow, is puerile
      enough. Any Tory victory, it may be said, is little more than a pause in
      the strife, unless when the Radical game is played ‘to dish the Whigs,’ 
      and the Tories are now fast bound down by their incorporation of the
      latter to abstain from the violent springs and right-about-facings of the
      Derby-Disraeli period. They are so heavily weighted by the new combination
      that their Jack-in-the-box, Lord Randolph, will have to stand like an
      ordinary sentinel on duty, and take the measurement of his natural size.
      They must, on the supposition of their entry into office, even to satisfy
      their own constituents, produce a scheme. Their majority in the House will
      command it.
    </p>
<p>
      To this extent, then, Mr. Gladstone has not been defeated. The question
      set on fire by him will never be extinguished until the combustible matter
      has gone to ashes. But personally he meets a sharp rebuff. The Tories may
      well raise hurrahs over that. Radicals have to admit it, and point to the
      grounds of it. Between a man’s enemies and his friends there comes out a
      rough painting of his character, not without a resemblance to the final
      summary, albeit wanting in the justly delicate historical touch to
      particular features. On the one side he is abused as ‘the one-man power’;
      lauded on the other for his marvellous intuition of the popular will. One
      can believe that he scarcely wishes to march dictatorially, and full
      surely his Egyptian policy was from step to step a misreading of the will
      of the English people. He went forth on this campaign, with the finger of
      Egypt not ineffectively levelled against him a second time. Nevertheless
      he does read his English; he has, too, the fatal tendency to the bringing
      forth of Bills in the manner of Jove big with Minerva. He perceived the
      necessity, and the issue of the necessity; clearly defined what must come,
      and, with a higher motive than the vanity with which his enemies charge
      him, though not with such high counsel as Wisdom at his ear, fell to work
      on it alone, produced the whole Bill alone, and then handed it to his
      Cabinet to digest, too much in love with the thing he had laid and
      incubated to permit of any serious dismemberment of its frame. Hence the
      disruption. He worked for the future, produced a Bill for the future, and
      is wrecked in the present. Probably he can work in no other way than from
      the impulse of his enthusiasm, solitarily. It is a way of making men
      overweeningly in love with their creations. The consequence is likely to
      be that Ireland will get her full measure of justice to appease her
      cravings earlier than she would have had as much from the United Liberal
      Cabinet, but at a cost both to her and to England. Meanwhile we are to
      have a House of Commons incapable of conducting public business; the
      tradesmen to whom the Times addressed pathetic condolences on the loss of
      their season will lose more than one; and we shall be made sensible that
      we have an enemy in our midst, until a people, slow to think, have taken
      counsel of their native generosity to put trust in the most generous race
      on earth.

<h2>
      CONCESSION TO THE CELT—1886
    </h2>
<p>
      Things are quiet outside an ant-hill until the stick has been thrust into
      it. Mr. Gladstone’s Bill for helping to the wiser government of Ireland
      has brought forth our busy citizens on the top-rubble in traversing
      counterswarms, and whatever may be said against a Bill that deals roughly
      with many sensitive interests, one asks whether anything less violently
      impressive would have roused industrious England to take this question at
      last into the mind, as a matter for settlement. The Liberal leader has
      driven it home; and wantonly, in the way of a pedestrian demagogue, some
      think; certainly to the discomposure of the comfortable and the myopely
      busy, who prefer to live on with a disease in the frame rather than at all
      be stirred. They can, we see, pronounce a positive electoral negative; yet
      even they, after the eighty and odd years of our domestic perplexity, in
      the presence of the eighty and odd members pledged for Home Rule, have
      been moved to excited inquiries regarding measures—short of the
      obnoxious Bill. How much we suffer from sniffing the vain incense of that
      word practical, is contempt of prevision! Many of the measures now being
      proposed responsively to the fretful cry for them, as a better alternative
      to correction by force of arms, are sound and just. Ten years back, or at
      a more recent period before Mr. Parnell’s triumph in the number of his
      followers, they would have formed a basis for the appeasement of the
      troubled land. The institution of county boards, the abolition of the
      detested Castle, something like the establishment of a Royal residence in
      Dublin, would have begun the work well. Materially and sentimentally, they
      were the right steps to take. They are now proposed too late. They are
      regarded as petty concessions, insufficient and vexatious. The lower and
      the higher elements in the population are fused by the enthusiasm of men
      who find themselves marching in full body on a road, under a flag, at the
      heels of a trusted leader; and they will no longer be fed with sops. Petty
      concessions are signs of weakness to the unsatisfied; they prick an
      appetite, they do not close breaches. If our object is, as we hear it
      said, to appease the Irish, we shall have to give them the Parliament
      their leader demands. It might once have been much less; it may be worried
      into a raving, perhaps a desperate wrestling, for still more. Nations pay
      Sibylline prices for want of forethought. Mr. Parnell’s terms are embodied
      in Mr. Gladstone’s Bill, to which he and his band have subscribed. The one
      point for him is the statutory Parliament, so that Ireland may civilly
      govern herself; and standing before the world as representative of his
      country, he addresses an applausive audience when he cites the total
      failure of England to do that business of government, as at least a
      logical reason for the claim. England has confessedly failed; the world
      says it, the country admits it. We have failed, and not because the
      so-called Saxon is incapable of understanding the Celt, but owing to our
      system, suitable enough to us, of rule by Party, which puts perpetually a
      shifting hand upon the reins, and invites the clamour it has to allay. The
      Irish—the English too in some degree—have been taught that
      roaring; in its various forms, is the trick to open the ears of Ministers.
      We have encouraged by irritating them to practise it, until it has become
      a habit, an hereditary profession with them. Ministers in turn have
      defensively adopted the arts of beguilement, varied by an exercise of the
      police. We grew accustomed to periods of Irish fever. The exhaustion
      ensuing we named tranquillity, and hoped that it would bear fruit. But we
      did not plant. The Party in office directed its attention to what was
      uppermost and urgent—to that which kicked them. Although we were
      living, by common consent; with a disease in the frame, eruptive at
      intervals, a national disfigurement always a danger, the Ministerial idea
      of arresting it for the purpose of healing was confined, before the
      passing of Mr. Gladstone’s well-meant Land Bill, to the occasional
      despatch of commissions; and, in fine, we behold through History the Irish
      malady treated as a form of British constitutional gout. Parliament
      touched on the Irish only when the Irish were active as a virus. Our later
      alternations of cajolery and repression bear painful resemblance to the
      nervous fit of rickety riders compounding with their destinations that
      they may keep their seats. The cajolery was foolish, if an end was in
      view; the repression inefficient. To repress efficiently we have to stifle
      a conscience accusing us of old injustice, and forget that we are sworn to
      freedom. The cries that we have been hearing for Cromwell or for Bismarck
      prove the existence of an impatient faction in our midst fitter to wear
      the collars of those masters whom they invoke than to drop a vote into the
      ballot-box. As for the prominent politicians who have displaced their
      rivals partly on the strength of an implied approbation of those cries, we
      shall see how they illumine the councils of a governing people. They are
      wiser than the barking dogs. Cromwell and Bismarck are great names; but
      the harrying of Ireland did not settle it, and to Germanize a Posen and
      call it peace will find echo only in the German tongue. Posen is the error
      of a master-mind too much given to hammer at obstacles. He has, however,
      the hammer. Can it be imagined in English hands? The braver exemplar for
      grappling with monstrous political tasks is Cavour, and he would not have
      hinted at the iron method or the bayonet for a pacification. Cavour
      challenged debate; he had faith in the active intellect, and that is the
      thing to be prayed for by statesmen who would register permanent
      successes. The Irish, it is true, do not conduct an argument coolly. Mr.
      Parnell and his eighty-five have not met the Conservative leader and his
      following in the Commons with the gravity of platonic disputants. But they
      have a logical position, equivalent to the best of arguments. They are
      representatives, they would say, of a country admittedly ill-governed by
      us; and they have accepted the Bill of the defeated Minister as final. Its
      provisions are their terms of peace. They offer in return for that boon to
      take the burden we have groaned under off our hands. If we answer that we
      think them insincere, we accuse these thrice accredited representatives of
      the Irish people of being hypocrites and crafty conspirators; and numbers
      in England, affected by the weapons they have used to get to their present
      strength, do think it; forgetful that our obtuseness to their constant
      appeals forced them into the extremer shifts of agitation. Yet it will
      hardly be denied that these men love Ireland; and they have not shown
      themselves by their acts to be insane. To suppose them conspiring for
      separation indicates a suspicion that they have neither hearts nor heads.
      For Ireland, separation is immediate ruin. It would prove a very short
      sail for these conspirators before the ship went down. The vital necessity
      of the Union for both, countries, obviously for the weaker of the two, is
      known to them; and unless we resume our exasperation of the wild fellow
      the Celt can be made by such a process, we have not rational grounds for
      treating him, or treating with him, as a Bedlamite. He has besides his
      passions shrewd sense; and his passions may be rightly directed by
      benevolent attraction. This is language derided by the victorious enemy;
      it speaks nevertheless what the world, and even troubled America, thinks
      of the Irish Celt. More of it now on our side of the Channel would be
      serviceable. The notion that he hates the English comes of his fevered
      chafing against the harness of England, and when subject to his fevers, he
      is unrestrained in his cries and deeds. That pertains to the nature of
      him. Of course, if we have no belief in the virtues of friendliness and
      confidence—none in regard to the Irishman—we show him his
      footing, and we challenge the issue. For the sole alternative is distinct
      antagonism, a form of war. Mr. Gladstone’s Bill has brought us to that
      definite line. Ireland having given her adhesion to it, swearing that she
      does so in good faith, and will not accept a smaller quantity, peace is
      only to be had by our placing trust in the Irish; we trust them or we
      crush them. Intermediate ways are but the prosecution of our ugly
      flounderings in Bogland; and dubious as we see the choice on either side,
      a decisive step to right or left will not show us to the world so bemired,
      to ourselves so miserably inefficient, as we appear in this session of a
      new Parliament. With his eighty-five, apart from external operations
      lawful or not, Mr. Parnell can act as a sort of lumbricus in the House.
      Let journalists watch and chronicle events: if Mr. Gladstone has humour,
      they will yet note a peculiar smile on his closed mouth from time to time
      when the alien body within the House, from which, for the sake of its
      dignity and ability to conduct its affairs, he would have relieved it till
      the day of a warmer intelligence between Irish and English, paralyzes our
      machinery business. An ably-handled coherent body in the midst of the
      liquid groups will make it felt that Ireland is a nation, naturally
      dependent though she must be. We have to do with forces in politics, and
      the great majority of the Irish Nationalists in Ireland has made them a
      force.
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt Mr. Matthew Arnold is correct in his apprehensions of the dangers
      we may fear from a Dublin House of Commons. The declarations and novel or
      ultra theories might almost be written down beforehand. I should, for my
      part, anticipate a greater danger in the familiar attitude of the English
      metropolitan Press and public toward an experiment they dislike and
      incline to dread:—the cynical comments, the quotations between
      inverted commas, the commiserating shrug, cold irony, raw banter, growl of
      menace, sharp snap, rounds of laughter. Frenchmen of the Young Republic,
      not presently appreciated as offensive, have had some of these careless
      trifles translated for them, and have been stung. We favoured Germany with
      them now and then, before Germany became the first power in Europe. Before
      America had displayed herself as greatest among the giants that do not go
      to pieces, she had, as Americans forgivingly remember, without mentioning,
      a series of flicks of the whip. It is well to learn manners without having
      them imposed on us. There are various ways for tripping the experiment.
      Nevertheless, when the experiment is tried, considering that our welfare
      is involved in its not failing, as we have failed, we should prepare to
      start it cordially, cordially assist it. Thoughtful political minds regard
      the measure as a backward step; yet conceiving but a prospect that a
      measure accepted by Home Rulers will possibly enable the Irish and English
      to step together, it seems better worth the venture than to pursue a
      course of prospectless discord! Whatever we do or abstain from doing has
      now its evident dangers, and this being imminent may appear the larger of
      them; but if a weighing of the conditions dictates it, and conscience
      approves, the wiser proceeding is to make trial of the untried. Our
      outlook was preternaturally black, with enormous increase of dangers when
      the originator of our species venturesomely arose from the posture of the
      ‘quatre pattes’. We consider that we have not lost by his temerity. In
      states of dubitation under impelling elements, the instinct pointing to
      courageous action is, besides the manlier, conjecturably the right one.

<h2>
      LESLIE STEPHEN—1904
    </h2>
<p>
      When that noble body of scholarly and cheerful pedestrians, the Sunday
      Tramps, were on the march, with Leslie Stephen to lead them, there was
      conversation which would have made the presence of a shorthand writer a
      benefaction to the country. A pause to it came at the examination of the
      leader’s watch and Ordnance map under the western sun, and void was given
      for the strike across country to catch the tail of a train offering dinner
      in London, at the cost of a run through hedges, over ditches and fellows,
      past proclamation against trespassers, under suspicion of being taken for
      more serious depredators in flight. The chief of the Tramps had a
      wonderful calculating eye in the observation of distances and the nature
      of the land, as he proved by his discovery of untried passes in the higher
      Alps, and he had no mercy for pursy followers. I have often said of this
      life-long student and philosophical head that he had in him the making of
      a great military captain. He would not have been opposed to the profession
      of arms if he had been captured early for the service, notwithstanding his
      abomination of bloodshed. He had a high, calm courage, was unperturbed in
      a dubious position, and would confidently take the way out of it which he
      conceived to be the better. We have not to deplore that he was diverted
      from the ways of a soldier, though England, as the country has been
      learning of late, cannot boast of many in uniform who have capacity for
      leadership. His work in literature will be reviewed by his lieutenant of
      Tramps, one of the ablest of writers!—[Frederic W. Maitland.]—The
      memory of it remains with us, as being the profoundest and the most sober
      criticism we have had in our time. The only sting in it was an inoffensive
      humorous irony that now and then stole out for a roll over, like a furry
      cub, or the occasional ripple on a lake in grey weather. We have nothing
      left that is like it.
    </p>
<p>
      One might easily fall into the pit of panegyric by an enumeration of his
      qualities, personal and literary. It would not be out of harmony with the
      temper and characteristics of a mind so equable. He, the equable, whether
      in condemnation or eulogy. Our loss of such a man is great, for work was
      in his brain, and the hand was active till close upon the time when his
      breathing ceased. The loss to his friends can be replaced only by an
      imagination that conjures him up beside them. That will be no task to
      those who have known him well enough to see his view of things as they
      are, and revive his expression of it. With them he will live despite the
      word farewell.

<h2>
      CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE SEAT OF WAR IN ITALY
    </h2>
<p>
      LETTERS WRITTEN TO THE MORNING POST FROM THE SEAT OF WAR IN ITALY FROM OUR
      OWN CORRESPONDENT
    </p>
<p>
      FERRARA, June 22, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      Before this letter reaches London the guns will have awakened both the
      echo of the old river Po and the classical Mincio. The whole of the
      troops, about 110,000 men, with which Cialdini intends to force the
      passage of the first-named river are already massed along the right bank
      of the Po, anxiously waiting that the last hour of to-morrow should
      strike, and that the order for action should be given. The telegraph will
      have already informed your readers that, according to the intimation sent
      by General Lamarmora on Tuesday evening to the Austrian headquarters, the
      three days fixed by the general’s message before beginning hostilities
      will expire at twelve p.m. of the 23rd of June.
    </p>
<p>
      Cialdini’s headquarters have been established in this city since Wednesday
      morning, and the famous general, in whom the fourth corps he commands, and
      the whole of the nation, has so much confidence, has concentrated the
      whole of his forces within a comparatively narrow compass, and is ready
      for action. I believe therefore that by to-morrow the right bank of the Po
      will be connected with the mainland of the Polesine by several pontoon
      bridges, which will enable Cialdini’s corps d’armee to cross the river,
      and, as everybody here hopes, to cross it in spite of any defence the
      Austrians may make.
    </p>
<p>
      On my way to this ancient city last evening I met General Cadogan and two
      superior Prussian officers, who by this time must have joined Victor
      Emmanuel’s headquarters at Cremona; if not, they have been by this time
      transferred elsewhere, more on the front, towards the line of the Mincio,
      on which, according to appearance, the first, second, and third Italian
      corps d’armee seem destined to operate. The English general and the two
      Prussian officers above mentioned are to follow the king’s staff, the
      first as English commissioner, the superior in rank of the two others in
      the same capacity.
    </p>
<p>
      I have been told here that, before leaving Bologna, Cialdini held a
      general council of the commanders of the seven divisions of which his
      powerful corps d’armee is formed, and that he told them that, in spite of
      the forces the enemy has massed on the left bank of the Po, between the
      point which faces Stellata and Rovigo, the river must be crossed by his
      troops, whatever might be the sacrifice this important operation requires.
      Cialdini is a man who knows how to keep his word, and, for this reason, I
      have no doubt he will do what he has already made up his mind to
      accomplish. I am therefore confident that before two or three days have
      elapsed, these 110,000 Italian troops, or a great part of them, will have
      trod, for the Italians, the sacred land of Venetia.
    </p>
<p>
      Once the river Po crossed by Cialdini’s corps d’armee, he will boldly
      enter the Polesine and make himself master of the road which leads by
      Rovigo towards Este and Padua. A glance at the map will show your readers
      how, at about twenty or thirty miles from the first-mentioned town, a
      chain of hills, called the Colli Euganei, stretches itself from the last
      spur of the Julian Alps, in the vicinity of Vicenza, gently sloping down
      towards the sea. As this line affords good positions for contesting the
      advance of an army crossing the Po at Lago Scuro, or at any other point
      not far from it, it is to be supposed that the Austrians will make a stand
      there, and I should not be surprised at all that Cialdini’s first battle,
      if accepted by the enemy, should take place within that comparatively
      narrow ground which is within Montagnana, Este, Terradura, Abano, and
      Padua. It is impossible to suppose that Cialdini’s corps d’armee, being so
      large, is destined to cross the Po only at one point of the river below
      its course: it is extremely likely that part of it should cross it at some
      point above, between Revere and Stellata, where the river is in two or
      three instances only 450 metres wide. Were the Italian general to be
      successful—protected as he will be by the tremendous fire of the
      powerful artillery he disposes of—in these twofold operations, the
      Austrians defending the line of the Colli Euganei could be easily
      outflanked by the Italian troops, who would have crossed the river below
      Lago Scuro. Of course these are mere suppositions, for nobody, as you may
      imagine, except the king, Cialdini himself, Lamarmora, Pettiti, and
      Menabrea, is acquainted with the plan of the forthcoming campaign. There
      was a rumour at Cialdini’s headquarters to-day that the Austrians had
      gathered in great numbers in the Polesine, and especially at Rovigo, a
      small town which they have strongly fortified of late, with an apparent
      design to oppose the crossing of the Po, were Cialdini to attempt it at or
      near Lago Scuro. There are about Rovigo large tracts of marshes and fields
      cut by ditches and brooks, which, though owing to the dryness of the
      season [they] cannot be, as it was generally believed two weeks ago,
      easily inundated, yet might well aid the operations the Austrians may
      undertake in order to check the advance of the Italian fourth corps
      d’armee. The resistance to the undertaking of Cialdini may be, on the part
      of the Austrians, very stout, but I am almost certain that it will be
      overcome by the ardour of Italian troops, and by the skill of their
      illustrious leader.
    </p>
<p>
      As I told you above, the declaration of war was handed over to an Austrian
      major for transmission to Count Stancowick, the Austrian governor of
      Mantua, on the evening of the 19th, by Colonel Bariola, sous-chef of the
      general staff, who was accompanied by the Duke Luigi of Sant’ Arpino, the
      husband of the amiable widow of Lord Burghersh. The duke is the eldest son
      of Prince San Teodoro, one of the wealthiest noblemen of Naples. In spite
      of his high position and of his family ties, the Duke of Sant’ Arpino, who
      is well known in London fashionable society, entered as a volunteer in the
      Italian army, and was appointed orderly officer to General Lamarmora. The
      choice of such a gentleman for the mission I am speaking of was apparently
      made with intention, in order to show the Austrians, that the Neapolitan
      nobility is as much interested in the national movement as the middle and
      lower classes of the Kingdom, once so fearfully misruled by the Bourbons.
      The Duke of Sant’ Arpino is not the only Neapolitan nobleman who has
      enlisted in the Italian army since the war with Austria broke out. In
      order to show you the importance which must be given to this
      pronunciamiento of the Neapolitan noblemen, allow me to give you here a
      short list of the names of those of them who have enlisted as private
      soldiers in the cavalry regiments of the regular army: The Duke of
      Policastro; the Count of Savignano Guevara, the eldest son of the Duke of
      Bovino; the Duke d’Ozia d’Angri, who had emigrated in 1860, and returned
      to Naples six months ago; Marquis Rivadebro Serra; Marquis Pisicelli,
      whose family had left Naples in 1860 out of devotion to Francis II.; two
      Carraciolos, of the historical family from which sprung the unfortunate
      Neapolitan admiral of this name, whose head Lord Nelson would have done
      better not to have sacrificed to the cruelty of Queen Caroline; Prince
      Carini, the representative of an illustrious family of Sicily, a nephew of
      the Marquis del Vasto; and Pescara, a descendant of that great general of
      Charles V., to whom the proud Francis I. of France was obliged to
      surrender and give up his sword at the battle of Pavia. Besides these
      Neapolitan noblemen who have enlisted of late as privates, the Italian
      army now encamped on the banks of the Po and of the Mincio may boast of
      two Colonnas, a prince of Somma, two Barons Renzi, an Acquaviva, of the
      Duke of Atri, two Capece, two Princes Buttera, etc. To return to the
      mission of Colonel Bariola and the Duke of Sant’ Arpino, I will add some
      details which were told me this morning by a gentleman who left Cremona
      yesterday evening, and who had them from a reliable source. The messenger
      of General Lamarmora had been directed to proceed from Cremona to the
      small village of Le Grazie, which, on the line of the Mincio, marks the
      Austrian and Italian frontier.
    </p>
<p>
      On the right bank of the Lake of Mantua, in the year 1340, stood a small
      chapel containing a miraculous painting of the Madonna, called by the
      people of the locality ‘Santa Maria delle Grazie.’ The boatmen and
      fishermen of the Mincio, who had been, as they said, often saved from
      certain death by the Madonna—as famous in those days as the modern
      Lady of Rimini, celebrated for the startling feat of winking her eyes—determined
      to erect for her a more worthy abode.
    </p>
<p>
      Hence arose the Santuario delle Grazie. Here, as at Loretto and other holy
      localities of Italy, a fair is held, in which, amongst a great number of
      worldly things, rosaries, holy images, and other miraculous objects are
      sold, and astounding boons are said to be secured at the most trifling
      expense. The Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie enjoying a far-spread
      reputation, the dumb, deaf, blind, and halt-in short, people afflicted
      with all sorts of infirmities—flock thither during the fair, and are
      not wanting even on the other days of the year. The church of Le Grazie is
      one of the most curious of Italy. Not that there is anything remarkable in
      its architecture, for it is an Italian Gothic structure of the simplest
      style. But the ornamental part of the interior is most peculiar. The walls
      of the building are covered with a double row of wax statues, of life
      size, representing a host of warriors, cardinals, bishops, kings, and
      popes, who—as the story runs—pretended to have received some
      wonderful grace during their earthly existence. Amongst the grand array of
      illustrious personages, there are not a few humbler individuals whose
      history is faithfully told (if you choose to credit it) by the painted
      inscriptions below. There is even a convict, who, at the moment of being
      hanged, implored succour of the all-powerful Madonna, whereupon the beam
      of the gibbet instantly broke, and the worthy individual was restored to
      society—a very doubtful benefit after all. On Colonel Bariola and
      the Duke of Sant’ Arpino arriving at this place, which is only five miles
      distant from Mantua, their carriage was naturally stopped by the
      commissaire of the Austrian police, whose duty was to watch the frontier.
      Having told him that they had a despatch to deliver either to the military
      governor of Mantua or to some officer sent by him to receive it, the
      commissaire at once despatched a mounted gendarme to Mantua. Two hours had
      scarcely elapsed when a carriage drove into the village of Le Grazie, from
      which an Austrian major of infantry alighted and hastened to a wooden hut
      where the two Italian officers were waiting. Colonel Bariola, who was
      trained in the Austrian military school of Viller Nashstad, and regularly
      left the Austrian service in 1848, acquainted the newly-arrived major with
      his mission, which was that of delivering the sealed despatch to the
      general in command of Mantua and receiving for it a regular receipt. The
      despatch was addressed to the Archduke Albert, commander-in-chief of the
      Austrian army of the South, care of the governor of Mantua. After the
      major had delivered the receipt, the three messengers entered into a
      courteous conversation, during which Colonel Bariola seized an opportunity
      of presenting the duke, purposely laying stress on the fact of his
      belonging to one of the most illustrious families of Naples. It happened
      that the Austrian major had also been trained in the same school where
      Colonel Bariola was brought up—a circumstance of which he was
      reminded by the Austrian officer himself. Three hours had scarcely elapsed
      from the arrival of the two Italian messengers of war at Le Grazie, on the
      Austrian frontier, when they were already on their way back to the
      headquarters of Cremona, where during the night the rumour was current
      that a telegram had been received by Lamarmora from Verona, in which
      Archduke Albert accepted the challenge. Victor Emmanuel, whom I saw at
      Bologna yesterday, arrived at Cremona in the morning at two o’clock, but
      by this time his Majesty’s headquarters must have removed more towards the
      front, in the direction of the Oglio. I should not be at all surprised
      were the Italian headquarters to be established by to-morrow either at
      Piubega or Gazzoldo, if not actually at Goito, a village, as you know,
      which marks the Italian-Austrian frontier on the Mincio. The whole of the
      first, second, and third Italian corps d’armee are by this time
      concentrated within that comparatively narrow space which lies between the
      position of Castiglione, Delle Stiviere, Lorrato, and Desenzano, on the
      Lake of Garda, and Solferino on one side; Piubega, Gazzoldo, Sacca, Goito,
      and Castellucchio on the other. Are these three corps d’armee to attack
      when they hear the roar of Cialdini’s artillery on the right bank of the
      Po? Are they destined to force the passage of the Mincio either at Goito
      or at Borghetto? or are they destined to invest Verona, storm Peschiera,
      and lay siege to Mantua? This is more than I can tell you, for, I repeat
      it, the intentions of the Italian leaders are enveloped in a veil which
      nobody—the Austrians included—has as yet been able to
      penetrate. One thing, however, is certain, and it is this, that as the
      clock of Victor Emmanuel marks the last minute of the seventy-second hour
      fixed by the declaration delivered at Le Grazie on Wednesday by Colonel
      Bariola to the Austrian major, the fair land where Virgil was born and
      Tasso was imprisoned will be enveloped by a thick cloud of the smoke of
      hundreds and hundreds of cannon. Let us hope that God will be in favour of
      right and justice, which, in this imminent and fierce struggle, is
      undoubtedly on the Italian side.
    </p>
<p>
      CREMONA, June 30, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      The telegraph will have already informed you of the concentration of the
      Italian army, whose headquarters have since Tuesday been removed from
      Redondesco to Piadena, the king having chosen the adjacent villa of
      Cigognolo for his residence. The concentrating movements of the royal army
      began on the morning of the 27th, i.e., three days after the bloody fait
      d’armes of the 24th, which, narrated and commented on in different manners
      according to the interests and passions of the narrators, still remains
      for many people a mystery. At the end of this letter you will see that I
      quote a short phrase with which an Austrian major, now prisoner of war,
      portrayed the results of the fierce struggle fought beyond the Mincio.
      This officer is one of the few survivors of a regiment of Austrian
      volunteers, uhlans, two squadrons of which he himself commanded. The
      declaration made by this officer was thoroughly explicit, and conveys the
      exact idea of the valour displayed by the Italians in that terrible fight.
      Those who incline to overrate the advantages obtained by the Austrians on
      Sunday last must not forget that if Lamarmora had thought proper to
      persist in holding the positions of Valeggio, Volta, and Goito, the
      Austrians could not have prevented him. It seems the Austrian
      general-in-chief shared this opinion, for, after his army had carried with
      terrible sacrifices the positions of Monte Vento and Custozza, it did not
      appear, nor indeed did the Austrians then give any signs, that they
      intended to adopt a more active system of warfare. It is the business of a
      commander to see that after a victory the fruit of it should not be lost,
      and for this reason the enemy is pursued and molested, and time is not
      left him for reorganization. Nothing of this happened after the 24th—nothing
      has been done by the Austrians to secure such results. The frontier which
      separates the two dominions is now the same as it was on the eve of the
      declaration of war. At Goito, at Monzambano, and in the other villages of
      the extreme frontier, the Italian authorities are still discharging their
      duties. Nothing is changed in those places, were we to except that now and
      then an Austrian cavalry party suddenly makes its appearance, with the
      only object of watching the movements of the Italian army. One of these
      parties, formed by four squadrons of the Wurtemberg hussar regiment,
      having advanced at six o’clock this morning on the right bank of the
      Mincio, met the fourth squadron of the Italian lancers of Foggia and were
      beaten back, and compelled to retire in disorder towards Goito and
      Rivolta. In this unequal encounter the Italian lancers distinguished
      themselves very much, made some Austrian hussars prisoners, and killed a
      few more, amongst whom was an officer. The same state of thing, prevails
      at Rivottella, a small village on the shores of the Lake of Garda, about
      four miles distant from the most advanced fortifications of Peschiera.
      There, as elsewhere, some Austrian parties advanced with the object of
      watching the movements of the Garibaldians, who occupy the hilly ground,
      which from Castiglione, Eseuta, and Cartel Venzago stretches to Lonato,
      Salo, and Desenzano, and to the mountain passes of Caffaro. In the
      last-named place the Garibaldians came to blows with the Austrians on the
      morning of the 28th, and the former got the best of the fray. Had the fait
      d’armes of the 24th, or the battle of Custozza, as Archduke Albrecht calls
      it, been a great victory for the Austrians, why should the imperial army
      remain in such inaction? The only conclusion we must come to is simply
      this, that the Austrian losses have been such as to induce the
      commander-in-chief of the army to act prudently on the defensive. We are
      now informed that the charges of cavalry which the Austrian lancers and
      the Hungarian hussars had to sustain near Villafranca on the 24th with the
      Italian horsemen of the Aorta and Alessandria regiments have been so fatal
      to the former that a whole division of the Kaiser cavalry must be
      reorganised before it can be brought into the field main.
    </p>
<p>
      The regiment of Haller hussars and two of volunteer uhlans were almost
      destroyed in that terrible charge. To give you an idea of this cavalry
      encounter, it is sufficient to say that Colonel Vandoni, at the head of
      the Aorta regiment he commands, charged fourteen times during the short
      period of four hours. The volunteer uhlans of the Kaiser regiment had
      already given up the idea of breaking through the square formed by the
      battalion, in the centre of which stood Prince Humbert of Savoy, when they
      were suddenly charged and literally cut to pieces by the Alessandria light
      cavalry, in spite of the long lances they carried. This weapon and the
      loose uniform they wear makes them resemble the Cossacks of the Don. There
      is one circumstance, which, if I am not mistaken, has not as yet been
      published by the newspapers, and it is this. There was a fight on the 25th
      on a place at the north of Roverbella, between the Italian regiment of
      Novara cavalry and a regiment of Hungarian hussars, whose name is not
      known. This regiment was so thoroughly routed by the Italians that it was
      pursued as far as Villafranca, and had two squadrons put hors de combat,
      whilst the Novara regiment only lost twenty-four mounted men. I think it
      right to mention this, for it proves that, the day after the bloody affair
      of the 24th, the Italian army had still a regiment of cavalry operating at
      Villafranca, a village which lay at a distance of fifteen kilometres from
      the Italian frontier. A report, which is much accredited here, explains
      how the Italian army did not derive the advantages it might have derived
      from the action of the 24th. It appears that the orders issued from the
      Italian headquarters during the previous night, and especially the verbal
      instructions given by Lamarmora and Pettiti to the staff officers of the
      different army corps, were either forgotten or misunderstood by those
      officers. Those sent to Durando, the commander of the first corps, seem to
      have been as follows: That he should have marched in the direction of
      Castelnuovo, without, however, taking part in the action. Durando, it is
      generally stated, had strictly adhered to the orders sent from the
      headquarters, but it seems that General Cerale understood them too
      literally. Having been ordered to march on Castelnuovo, and finding the
      village strongly held by the Austrians, who received his division with a
      tremendous fire, he at once engaged in the action instead of falling back
      on the reserve of the first corps and waiting new instructions. If such
      was really the case, it is evident that Cerale thought that the order to
      march which he had received implied that he was to attack and get
      possession of Castelnuovo, had this village, as it really was, already
      been occupied by the enemy. In mentioning this fact I feel bound to
      observe that I write it under the most complete reserve, for I should be
      sorry indeed to charge General Cerale with having misunderstood such an
      important order.
    </p>
<p>
      I see that one of your leading contemporaries believes that it would be
      impossible for the king or Lamarmora to say what result they expected from
      their ill-conceived and worse-executed attempt. The result they expected
      is, I think, clear enough; they wanted to break through the quadrilateral
      and make their junction with Cialdini, who was ready to cross the Po
      during the night of the 24th. That the attempt was ill-conceived and
      worse-executed, neither your contemporary nor the public at large has, for
      the present, the right to conclude, for no one knows as yet but
      imperfectly the details of the terrible fight. What is certain, however,
      is that General Durando, perceiving that the Cerale division was lost, did
      all that he could to help it. Failing in this he turned to his two
      aides-de-camp and coolly said to them:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, gentlemen, it is time for you to retire, for I have a duty to
      perform which is a strictly personal one—the duty of dying.’ On
      saying these words he galloped to the front and placed himself at about
      twenty paces from a battalion of Austrian sharp-shooters which were
      ascending the hill. In less than five minutes his horse was killed under
      him, and he was wounded in the right hand. I scarcely need add that his
      aides-de-camp did not flinch from sharing Durando’s fate. They bravely
      followed their general, and one, the Marquis Corbetta, was wounded in the
      leg; the other, Count Esengrini, had his horse shot under him. I called on
      Durando, who is now at Milan, the day before yesterday. Though a stranger
      to him, he received me at once, and, speaking of the action of the 24th,
      he only said: ‘I have the satisfaction of having done my duty. I wait
      tranquilly the judgement of history.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Assuming, for argument’s sake, that General Cerale misunderstood the
      orders he had received, and that, by precipitating his movement, he
      dragged into the same mistake the whole of Durando’s corps—assuming,
      I say, this to be the right version, you can easily explain the fact that
      neither of the two contending parties are as yet in a position clearly to
      describe the action of the 24th. Why did neither the one nor the other
      display and bring into action the whole forces they could have had at
      their disposal? Why so many partial engagements at a great distance one
      from the other? In a word, why that want of unity, which, in my opinion,
      constituted the paramount characteristic of that bloody struggle? I may be
      greatly mistaken, but I am of opinion that neither the Italian
      general-in-chief nor the Austrian Archduke entertained on the night of the
      23rd the idea of delivering a battle on the 24th. There, and only there,
      lies the whole mystery of the affair. The total want of unity of action on
      the part of the Italians assured to the Austrians, not the victory, but
      the chance of rendering impossible Lamarmora’s attempt to break through
      the quadrilateral. This no one can deny; but, on the other hand, if the
      Italian army failed in attaining its object, the failure-owing to the
      bravery displayed both by the soldiers and by the generals-was far from
      being a disastrous or irreparable one. The Italians fought from three
      o’clock in the morning until nine in the evening like lions, showing to
      their enemies and to Europe that they know how to defend their country,
      and that they are worthy of the noble enterprise they have undertaken.
    </p>
<p>
      But let me now register one of the striking episodes of that memorable
      day. It was five o’clock p.m. when General Bixio, whose division held an
      elevated position not far from Villafranca, was attacked by three strong
      Austrian brigades, which had debouched at the same time from three
      different roads, supported with numerous artillery. An officer of the
      Austrian staff, waving a white handkerchief, was seen galloping towards
      the front of Bixio’s position, and, once in the presence of this general,
      bade him surrender. Those who are not personally acquainted with Bixio
      cannot form an idea of the impression this bold demand must have made on
      him. I have been told that, on hearing the word ‘surrender,’ his face
      turned suddenly pale, then flushed like purple, and darting at the
      Austrian messenger, said, ‘Major, if you dare to pronounce once more the
      word surrender in my presence, I tell you—and Bixio always keeps his
      word—that I will have you shot at once.’ The Austrian officer had
      scarcely reached the general who had sent him, than Bixio, rapidly moving
      his division, fell with such impetuosity on the Austrian column, which
      were ascending the hill, that they were thrown pellmell in the valley,
      causing the greatest confusion amongst their reserve. Bixio himself led
      his men, and with his aides-de-camp, Cavaliere Filippo Fermi, Count
      Martini, and Colonel Malenchini, all Tuscans, actually charged the enemy.
      I have been told that, on hearing this episode, Garibaldi said, ‘I am not
      at all surprised, for Bixio is the best general I have made.’ Once the
      enemy was repulsed, Bixio was ordered to manoeuvre so as to cover the
      backward movement of the army, which was orderly and slowly retiring on
      the Mincio. Assisted by the co-operation of the heavy cavalry, commanded
      by General Count de Sonnaz, Bixio covered the retreat, and during the
      night occupied Goito, a position which he held till the evening of the
      27th.
    </p>
<p>
      In consequence of the concentrating movement of the Italian army which I
      have mentioned at the beginning of this letter, the fourth army corps
      (Cialdini’s) still holds the line of the Po. If I am rightly informed, the
      decree for the formation of the fourth army corps was signed by the king
      yesterday. This corps is that of Garibaldi, and is about 40,000 strong. An
      officer who has just returned from Milan told me this morning that he had
      had an opportunity of speaking with the Austrian prisoners sent from Milan
      to the fortress of Finestrelle in Piedmont. Amongst them was an officer of
      a uhlan regiment, who had all the appearance of belonging to some
      aristocratic family of Austrian Poland. Having been asked if he thought
      Austria had really gained the battle on the 24th, he answered: ‘I do not
      know if the illusions of the Austrian army go so far as to induce it to
      believe it has obtained a victory—I do not believe it. He who loves
      Austria cannot, however, wish she should obtain such victories, for they
      are the victories of Pyrrhus!
    </p>
<p>
      There is at Verona some element in the Austrian councils of war which we
      don’t understand, but which gives to their operations in this present
      phase of the campaign just as uncertain and as vacillating a character as
      it possessed during the campaign of 1859. On Friday they are still beyond
      the Mincio, and on Saturday their small fleet on the Lake of Garda steams
      up to Desenzano, and opens fire against this defenceless city and her
      railway station, whilst two battalions of Tyrolese sharp-shooters occupy
      the building. On Sunday they retire, but early yesterday they cross the
      Mincio, at Goito and Monzambano, and begin to throw two bridges over the
      same river, between the last-named place and the mills of Volta. At the
      same time they erect batteries at Goito, Torrione, and Valeggio, pushing
      their reconnoitring parties of hussars as far as Medole, Castiglione delle
      Stiviere, and Montechiara, this last-named place being only at a distance
      of twenty miles from Brescia. Before this news reached me here this
      morning I was rather inclined to believe that they were playing at
      hide-and-seek, in the hope that the leaders of the Italian army should be
      tempted by the game and repeat, for the second time, the too hasty attack
      on the quadrilateral. This news, which I have from a reliable source, has,
      however, changed my former opinion, and I begin to believe that the
      Austrian Archduke has really made up his mind to come out from the
      strongholds of the quadrilateral, and intends actually to begin war on the
      very battlefields where his imperial cousin was beaten on the 24th June
      1859. It may be that the partial disasters sustained by Benedek in Germany
      have determined the Austrian Government to order a more active system of
      war against Italy, or, as is generally believed here, that the
      organisation of the commissariat was not perfect enough with the army
      Archduke Albert commands to afford a more active and offensive action. Be
      that as it may, the fact is that the news received here from several parts
      of Upper Lombardy seems to indicate, on the part of the Austrians, the
      intention of attacking their adversaries.
    </p>
<p>
      Yesterday whilst the peaceable village of Gazzoldo—five Italian
      miles from Goito—was still buried in the silence of night it was
      occupied by 400 hussars, to the great consternation of the people who were
      roused from their sleep by the galloping of their unexpected visitors. The
      sindaco, or mayor of the village, who is the chemist of the place, was, I
      hear, forcibly taken from his house and compelled to escort the Austrians
      on the road leading to Piubega and Redondesco. This worthy magistrate, who
      was not apparently endowed with sufficient courage to make at least half a
      hero, was so much frightened that he was taken ill, and still is in a very
      precarious condition. These inroads are not always accomplished with
      impunity, for last night, not far from Guidizzuolo, two squadrons of
      Italian light cavalry—Cavalleggieri di Lucca, if I am rightly
      informed—at a sudden turn of the road leading from the last-named
      village to Cerlongo, found themselves almost face to face with four
      squadrons of uhlans. The Italians, without numbering their foes, set spurs
      to their horses and fell like thunder on the Austrians, who, after a fight
      which lasted more than half an hour, were put to flight, leaving on the
      ground fifteen men hors de combat, besides twelve prisoners.
    </p>
<p>
      Whilst skirmishing of this kind is going on in the flat ground of Lombardy
      which lies between the Mincio and the Chiese, a more decisive action has
      been adopted by the Austrian corps which is quartered in the Italian Tyrol
      and Valtellina. A few days ago it was generally believed that the mission
      of this corps was only to oppose Garibaldi should he try to force those
      Alpine passes. But now we suddenly hear that the Austrians are already
      masters of Caffaro, Bagolino, Riccomassino, and Turano, which points they
      are fortifying. This fact explains the last movements made by Garibaldi
      towards that direction. But whilst the Austrians are massing their troops
      on the Tyrolese Alps the revolution is spreading fast in the more southern
      mountains of the Friuli and Cadorre, thus threatening the flank and rear
      of their army in Venetia. This revolutionary movement may not have as yet
      assumed great proportions, but as it is the effect of a plan proposed
      beforehand it might become really imposing, more so as the ranks of those
      Italian patriots are daily swollen by numerous deserters and refractory
      men of the Venetian regiments of the Austrian army.
    </p>
<p>
      Although the main body of the Austrians seems to be still concentrated
      between Peschiera and Verona, I should not wonder if they crossed the
      Mincio either to-day or to-morrow, with the object of occupying the
      heights of Volta, Cavriana, and Solferino, which, both by their position
      and by the nature of the ground, are in themselves so many fortresses.
      Supposing that the Italian army should decide for action—and there
      is every reason to believe that such will be the case—it is not
      unlikely that, as we had already a second battle at Custozza, we may have
      a second one at Solferino.
    </p>
<p>
      That at the Italian headquarters something has been decided upon which may
      hasten the forward movement of the army, I infer from the fact that the
      foreign military commissioners at the Italian headquarters, who, after the
      24th June had gone to pass the leisure of their camp life at Cremona, have
      suddenly made their appearance at Torre Malamberti, a villa belonging to
      the Marquis Araldi, where Lamarmora’s staff is quartered. A still more
      important event is the presence of Baron Ricasoli, whom I met yesterday
      evening on coming here. The President of the Council was coming from
      Florence, and, after stopping a few hours at the villa of Cicognolo, where
      Victor Emmanuel and the royal household are staying, he drove to Torre
      Malamberti to confer with General Lamarmora and Count Pettiti. The
      presence of the baron at headquarters is too important an incident to be
      overlooked by people whose business is that of watching the course of
      events in this country. And it should be borne in mind that on his way to
      headquarters Baron Ricasoli stopped a few hours at Bologna, where he had a
      long interview with Cialdini. Nor is this all; for the most important fact
      I have to report to-day is, that whilst I am writing (five o’clock a.m.)
      three corps of the Italian army are crossing the Oglio at different points—all
      three acting together and ready for any occurrence. This reconnaissance en
      force may, as you see, be turned into a regular battle should the
      Austrians have crossed the Mincio with the main body of their army during
      the course of last night. You see that the air around me smells enough of
      powder to justify the expectation of events which are likely to exercise a
      great influence over the cause of right and justice—the cause of
      Italy.

<p>
      MARCARIA, July 3, Evening.
    </p>
<p>
      Murray’s guide will save me the trouble of telling you what this little
      and dirty hole of Marcaria is like. The river Oglio runs due south, not
      far from the village, and cuts the road which from Bozzolo leads to
      Mantua. It is about seven miles from Castellucchio, a town which, since
      the peace of Villafranca, marked the Italian frontier in Lower Lombardy.
      Towards this last-named place marched this morning the eleventh division
      of the Italians under the command of General Angioletti, only a month ago
      Minister of the Marine in Lamarmora’s Cabinet. Angioletti’s division of
      the second corps was, in the case of an attack, to be supported by the
      fourth and eighth, which had crossed the Oglio at Gazzuolo four hours
      before the eleventh had started from the place from which I am now
      writing. Two other divisions also moved in an oblique line from the upper
      course of the above-mentioned river, crossed it on a pontoon bridge, and
      were directed to maintain their communications with Angioletti’s on the
      left, whilst the eighth and fourth would have formed its right. These five
      divisions were the avant garde of the main body of the Italian army. I am
      not in a position to tell you the exact line the army thus advancing from
      the Oglio has followed, but I have been told that, in order to avoid the
      possibility of repeating the errors which occurred in the action of the
      24th, the three corps d’armee have been directed to march in such a manner
      as to enable them to present a compact mass should they meet the enemy.
      Contrary to all expectations, Angioletti’s division was allowed to enter
      and occupy Castellucchio without firing a shot. As its vanguard reached
      the hamlet of Ospedaletto it was informed that the Austrians had left
      Castellucchio during the night, leaving a few hussars, who, in their turn,
      retired on Mantua as soon as they saw the cavalry Angioletti had sent to
      reconnoitre both the country and the borough of Castellucchio.
    </p>
<p>
      News has just arrived here that General Angioletti has been able to push
      his outposts as far as Rivolta on his left, and still farther forward on
      his front towards Curtalone. Although the distance from Rivolta to Goito
      is only five miles, Angioletti, I have been told, could not ascertain
      whether the Austrians had crossed the Mincio in force.
    </p>
<p>
      What part both Cialdini and Garibaldi will play in the great struggle
      nobody can tell. It is certain, however, that these two popular leaders
      will not be idle, and that a battle, if fought, will assume the
      proportions of an almost unheard of slaughter.
    </p>
<p>
      GENERAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE ITALIAN ARMY, TORRE MALIMBERTI, July 7, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      Whilst the Austrian emperor throws himself at the feet of the ruler of
      France—I was almost going to write the arbiter of Europe—Italy
      and its brave army seem to reject disdainfully the idea of getting Venetia
      as a gift of a neutral power. There cannot be any doubt as to the feeling
      in existence since the announcement of the Austrian proposal by the
      Moniteur being one of astonishment, and even indignation so far as Italy
      herself is concerned. One hears nothing but expressions of this kind in
      whatever Italian town he may be, and the Italian army is naturally anxious
      that she should not be said to relinquish her task when Austrians speak of
      having beaten her, without proving that she can beat them too. There are
      high considerations of honour which no soldier or general would ever think
      of putting aside for humanitarian or political reasons, and with these
      considerations the Italian army is fully in accord since the 24th June.
      The way, too, in which the Kaiser chose to give up the long-contested
      point, by ignoring Italy and recognising France as a party to the Venetian
      question, created great indignation amongst the Italians, whose papers
      declare, one and all, that a fresh insult has been offered to the country.
      This is the state of public opinion here, and unless the greatest
      advantages are obtained by a premature armistice and a hurried treaty of
      peace, it is likely to continue the same, not to the entire security of
      public order in Italy. As a matter of course, all eyes are turned towards
      Villa Pallavicini, two miles from here, where the king is to decide upon
      either accepting or rejecting the French emperor’s advice, both of which
      decisions are fraught with considerable difficulties and no little danger.
      The king will have sought the advice of his ministers, besides which that
      of Prussia will have been asked and probably given. The matter may be
      decided one way or the other in a very short time, or may linger on for
      days to give time for public anxiety and fears to be allayed and to calm
      down. In the meantime, it looks as if the king and his generals had made
      up their mind not to accept the gift. An attack on the Borgoforte
      tete-de-pont on the right side of the Po, began on 5th at half-past three
      in the morning, under the immediate direction of General Cialdini. The
      attacking corps was the Duke of Mignano’s. All the day yesterday the gun
      was heard at Torre Malamberti, as it was also this morning between ten and
      eleven o’clock. Borgoforte is a fortress on the left side of the Po,
      throwing a bridge across this river, the right end of which is headed by a
      strong tete-de-pont, the object of the present attack. This work may be
      said to belong to the quadrilateral, as it is only an advanced part of the
      fortress of Mantua, which, resting upon its rear, is connected to
      Borgoforte by a military road supported on the Mantua side by the Pietolo
      fortress. The distance between Mantua and Borgoforte is only eleven
      kilometres. The fete-de-poet is thrown upon the Po; its structure is of
      recent date, and it consists of a central part and of two wings, called
      Rocchetta and Bocca di Ganda respectively. The lock here existing is
      enclosed in the Rocchetta work.
    </p>
<p>
      Since I wrote you my last letter Garibaldi has been obliged to desist from
      the idea of getting possession of Bagolino, Sant’ Antonio, and Monte
      Suello, after a fight which lasted four hours, seeing that he had to deal
      with an entire Austrian brigade, supported by uhlans, sharp-shooters
      (almost a battalion) and twelve pieces of artillery. These positions were
      subsequently abandoned by the enemy, and occupied by Garibaldi’s
      volunteers. In this affair the general received a slight wound in his left
      leg, the nature of which, however, is so very trifling, that a few days
      will be enough to enable him to resume active duties. It seems that the
      arms of the Austrians proved to be much superior to those of the
      Garibaldians, whose guns did very bad service. The loss of the latter
      amounted to about 100 killed and 200 wounded, figures in which the
      officers appear in great proportion, owing to their having been always at
      the head of their men, fighting, charging, and encouraging their comrades
      throughout. Captain Adjutant-Major Battino, formerly of the regular army,
      died, struck by three bullets, while rushing on the Austrians with the
      first regiment. On abandoning the Caffaro line, which they had reoccupied
      after the Lodrone encounter—in consequence of which the Garibaldians
      had to fall back because of the concentration following the battle of
      Custozza—the Austrians have retired to the Lardara fortress, between
      the Stabolfes and Tenara mountains, covering the route to Tione and
      Trento, in the Italian Tyrol. The third regiment of volunteers suffered
      most, as two of their companies had to bear the brunt of the terrible
      Austrian fire kept up from formidable positions. Another fight was taking
      place almost at the same time in the Val Camonico, i.e., north of the
      Caffaro, and of Rocca d’Anfo, Garibaldi’s point d’appui. This encounter
      was sustained in the same proportions, the Italians losing one of their
      bravest and best officers in the person of Major Castellini, a Milanese,
      commander of the second battalion of Lombardian bersaglieri. Although
      these and Major Caldesi’s battalion had to fall back from Vezza, a strong
      position was taken near Edalo, while in the rear a regiment kept Breno
      safe.
    </p>
<p>
      Although still at headquarters only two days ago, Baron Ricasoli has been
      suddenly summoned by telegram from Florence, and, as I hear, has just
      arrived. This is undoubtedly brought about by the new complications,
      especially as, at a council of ministers presided over by the baron, a
      vote, the nature of which is as yet unknown, was taken on the present
      state of affairs. As you know very well in England, Italy has great
      confidence in Ricasoli, whose conduct, always far from obsequious to the
      French emperor, has pleased the nation. He is thought to be at this moment
      the right man in the right place, and with the great acquaintance he
      possesses of Italy and the Italians, and with the co-operation of such an
      honest man as General Lamarmora, Italy may be pronounced safe, both
      against friends and enemies.
    </p>
<p>
      From what I saw this morning, coming back from the front, I presume that
      something, and that something new perhaps, will be attempted to-morrow. So
      far, the proposed armistice has had no effect upon the dispositions at
      general headquarters, and did not stay the cannon’s voice. In the middle
      of rumours, of hopes and fears, Italy’s wish to push on with the war has
      as yet been adhered to by her trusted leaders.

<h2>
      HEADQUARTERS OF THE FIRST ARMY CORPS,
    </h2>
<h3>
      PIADENA, July 8, 1866.
    </h3>
<p>
      As I begin writing you, no doubt can be entertained that some movement is
      not only in contemplation at headquarters, but is actually provided to
      take place to-day, and that it will probably prove to be against the
      Austrian positions at Borgoforte, on the left bank of the Po. Up to this
      time the tete-de-pout on the right side of the river had only been
      attacked by General the Duke of Mignano’s guns. It would now, on the
      contrary, be a matter of cutting the communications between Borgoforte and
      Mantua, by occupying the lower part of the country around the latter
      fortress, advancing upon the Valli Veronesi, and getting round the
      quadrilateral into Venetia. While, then, waiting for further news to tell
      us whether this plan has been carried into execution, and whether it will
      be pursued, mindless of the existence of Mantua and Borgoforte on its
      flanks, one great fact is already ascertained, that the armistice proposed
      by the Emperor Napoleon has not been accepted, and that the war is to be
      continued. The Austrians may shut themselves up in their strongholds, or
      may even be so obliging as to leave the king the uncontested possession of
      them by retreating in the same line as their opponents advance; the
      pursuit, if not the struggle, the war, if not the battle, will be carried
      on by the Italians. At Torre Malamberti, where the general headquarters
      are, no end of general officers were to be seen yesterday hurrying in all
      directions. I met the king, Generals Brignone, Gavone, Valfre, and
      Menabrea within a few minutes of one another, and Prince Amadeus, who has
      entirely recovered from his wound, had been telegraphed for, and will
      arrive in Cremona to-day. No precise information is to be obtained
      respecting the intentions of the Austrians, but it is to be hoped for the
      Italian army, and for the credit of its generals, that more will be known
      about them now than was known on the eve of the famous 24th of June, and
      on its very morning. The heroism of the Italians on that memorable day
      surpasses any possible idea that can be formed, as it did also surpass all
      expectations of the country. Let me relate you a few out of many heroic
      facts which only come to light when an occasion is had of speaking with
      those who have been eyewitnesses of them, as they are no object of
      magnified regimental—orders or, as yet, of well-deserved honours.
      Italian soldiers seem to think that the army only did its duty, and that,
      wherever Italians may fight, they will always show equal valour and
      firmness. Captain Biraghi, of Milan, belonging to the general staff,
      having in the midst of the battle received an order from General Lamarmora
      for General Durando, was proceeding with all possible speed towards the
      first army corps, which was slowly retreating before the superior forces
      of the enemy and before the greatly superior number of his guns, when,
      while under a perfect shower of grape and canister, he was all of a sudden
      confronted by, an Austrian officer of cavalry who had been lying in wait
      for the Italian orderly. The Austrian fires his revolver at Biraghi; and
      wounds him in the arm. Nothing daunted, Biraghi assails him and makes him
      turn tail; then, following in pursuit, unsaddles him, but has his own
      horse shot down under him. Biraghi disentangles himself, kills his
      antagonist, and jumps upon the latter’s horse. This, however, is thrown
      down also in a moment by a cannon ball, so that the gallant captain has to
      go back on foot, bleeding, and almost unable to walk. Talking of heroism,
      of inimitable endurance, and strength of soul, what do you think of a man
      who has his arm entirely carried away by a grenade, and yet keeps on his
      horse, firm as a rock, and still directs his battery until hemorrhage—and
      hemorrhage alone—strikes him down at last, dead! Such was the case
      with a Neapolitan—Major Abate, of the artillery—and his name
      is worth the glory of a whole army, of a whole war; and may only find a
      fit companion in that of an officer of the eighteenth battalion of
      bersaglieri, who, dashing at an Austrian flag-bearer, wrenches the
      standard out of his hands with his left one, has it clean cut away by an
      Austrian officer standing near, and immediately grapples it with his
      right, until his own soldiers carry him away with his trophy! Does not
      this sound like Greek history repeated—does it not look as if the
      brave men of old had been born again, and the old facts renewed to tell of
      Italian heroism? Another bersagliere—a Tuscan, by name Orlandi
      Matteo, belonging to that heroic fifth battalion which fought against
      entire brigades, regiments, and battalions, losing 11 out of its 16
      officers, and about 300 out of its 600 men—Orlandi, was wounded
      already, when, perceiving an Austrian flag, he makes a great effort,
      dashes at the officer, kills him, takes the flag, and, almost dying, gives
      it over to his lieutenant. He is now in a ward of the San Domenico
      Hospital in Brescia, and all who have learnt of his bravery will earnestly
      hope that he may survive to be pointed out as one of the many who covered
      themselves with fame on that day. If it is sad to read of death
      encountered in the field by so many a patriotic and brave soldiers, it is
      sadder still to learn that not a few of them were barbarously killed by
      the enemy, and killed, too, when they were harmless, for they lay wounded
      on the ground. The Sicilian colonel, Stalella, a son-in-law of Senator
      Castagnetto, and a courageous man amongst the most courageous of men; was
      struck in the leg by a bullet, and thrown down from his horse while
      exciting his men to repulse the Austrians, which in great masses were
      pressing on his thinned column. Although retreating, the regiment sent
      some of his men to take him away, but as soon as he had been put on a
      stretcher [he] had to be put down, as ten or twelve uhlans were galloping
      down, obliging the men to hide themselves in a bush. When the uhlans got
      near the colonel, and when they had seen him lying down in agony, they all
      planted their lances in his body.
    </p>
<p>
      Is not this wanton cruelty—cruelty even unheard of cruelty that no
      savage possesses? Still these are facts, and no one will ever dare to deny
      them from Verona and Vienna, for they are known as much as it was known
      and seen that the uhlans and many of the Austrian soldiers were drunk when
      they began fighting, and that alighting from the trains they were provided
      with their rations and with rum, and that they fought without their
      haversacks. This is the truth, and nothing beyond it has to the honour of
      the Italians been asserted, whether to the disgrace or credit of their
      enemies; so that while denying that they ill-treat Austrian prisoners,
      they are ready to state that theirs are well treated in Verona, without
      thinking of slandering and calumniating as the Vienna papers have done.
    </p>
<p>
      This morning Prince Amadeus arrived in Cremona, where a most spontaneous
      and hearty reception was given him by the population and the National
      Guard. He proceeded at once by the shortest way to the headquarters, so
      that his wish to be again at the front when something should be done has
      been accomplished. This brave young man, and his worthy brother, Prince
      Humbert, have won the applause of all Italy, which is justly proud of
      counting her king and her princes amongst the foremost in the field.
    </p>
<p>
      I have just learned from a most reliable source that the Austrians have
      mined the bridge of Borghetto on the Mincio, so that, should it be blown
      up, the only two, those of Goito and Borghetto, would be destroyed, and
      the Italians obliged to make provisional ones instead. I also hear that
      the Venetian towns are without any garrison, and that most probably all
      the forces are massed on two lines, one from Peschiera to Custozza and the
      other behind the Adige.
    </p>
<p>
      You will probably know by this time that the garrison of Vienna had on the
      3rd been directed to Prague. The news we receive from Prussia is on the
      whole encouraging, inasmuch as the greatly feared armistice has been
      repulsed by King William. Some people here think that France will not be
      too hard upon Italy for keeping her word with her ally, and that the brunt
      of French anger or disapproval will have to be borne by Prussia. This is
      the least she can expect, as you know!
    </p>
<p>
      It is probable that by to-morrow I shall be able to write you more about
      the Italo-Austrian war of 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      GONZAGA, July 9, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      I write you from a villa, only a mile distant from Gonzaga, belonging to
      the family of the Counts Arrivabene of Mantua. The owners have never
      reentered it since 1848, and it is only the fortune of war which has
      brought them to see their beautiful seat of the Aldegatta, never, it is to
      be hoped for them, to be abandoned again. It is, as you see, ‘Mutatum ab
      illo.’ Onward have gone, then, the exiled patriots! onward will go the
      nation that owns them! The wish of every one who is compelled to remain
      behind is that the army, that the volunteers, that the fleet, should all
      cooperate, and that they should, one and all, land on Venetian ground, to
      seek for a great battle, to give the army back the fame it deserves, and
      to the country the honour it possesses. The king is called upon to
      maintain the word nobly given to avenge Novara, and with it the new
      Austrian insulting proposal. All, it is said, is ready. The army has been
      said to be numerous; if to be numerous and brave, means to deserve
      victory, let the Italian generals prove what Italian soldiers are worthy
      of. If they will fight, the country will support them with the boldest of
      resolutions—the country will accept a discussion whenever the
      Government, having dispersed all fears, will proclaim that the war is to
      be continued till victory is inscribed on Italy’s shield.
    </p>
<p>
      As I am not far from Borgoforte, I am able to learn more than the mere
      cannon’s voice can tell me, and so will give you some details of the
      action against the tete-de-pont, which began, as I told you in one of my
      former letters, on the 4th. In Gorgoforte there were about 1500 Austrians,
      and, on the night from the 5th to the 6th, they kept up from their four
      fortified works a sufficiently well-sustained fire, the object of which
      was to prevent the enemy from posting his guns. This fire, however, did
      not cause any damage, and the Italians were able to plant their batteries.
      Early on the 6th, the firing began all along the line, the Italian
      16-pounders having been the first to open fire. The Italian right was
      commanded by Colonel Mattei, the left by Colonel Bangoni, who did
      excellent work, while the other wing was not so successful. The heaviest
      guns had not yet arrived owing to one of those incidents always sure to
      happen when least expected, so that the 40-pounders could not be brought
      to bear against the forts until later in the day. The damage done to the
      works was not great for the moment, but still the advantage had been
      gained of feeling the strength of the enemy’s positions and finding the
      right way to attack them. The artillerymen worked with great vigour, and
      were only obliged to desist by an unexpected order which arrived about two
      p.m. from General Cialdini. The attack was, however, resumed on the
      following day, and the condition of the Monteggiana and Rochetta forts may
      be pronounced precarious. As a sign of the times, and more especially of
      the just impatience which prevails in Italy about the general direction of
      the army movements, it may not be without importance to notice that the
      Italian press has begun to cry out against the darkness in which
      everything is enveloped, while the time already passed since the 24th June
      tells plainly of inaction. It is remarked that the bitter gift made by
      Austria of the Venetian provinces, and the suspicious offer of mediation
      by France, ought to have found Italy in greatly different condition, both
      as regards her political and military position. Italy is, on the contrary,
      in exactly the same state as when the Archduke Albert telegraphed to
      Vienna that a great success had been obtained over the Italian army. These
      are facts, and, however strong and worthy of respect may be the reasons,
      there is no doubt that an extraordinary delay in the resumption of
      hostilities has occurred, and that at the present moment operations
      projected are perfectly mysterious. Something is let out from time to time
      which only serves to make the subsequent absence of news more and more
      puzzling. For the present the first official relation of the unhappy fight
      of the 24th June is published, and is accordingly anxiously scanned and
      closely studied. It is a matter of general remark that no great military
      knowledge is required to perceive that too great a reliance was placed
      upon supposed facts, and that the indulgence of speculations and ideas
      caused the waste of so much precious blood. The prudence characterising
      the subsequent moves of the Austrians may have been caused by the effects
      of their opponents’ arrangements, but the Italian commanders ought to have
      avoided the responsibility of giving the enemy the option to move.
    </p>
<p>
      It is clear that to mend things the utterance of generous and patriotic
      cries is not sufficient, and that it must be shown that the vigour of the
      body is not at all surpassed by the vigour of the mind. It is also clear
      that many lives might have been spared if there had been greater proofs of
      intelligence on the part of those who directed the movement.
    </p>
<p>
      The situation is still very serious. Such an armistice as General von
      Gablenz could humiliate himself enough to ask from the Prussians has been
      refused, but another which the Emperor of the French has advised them to
      accept might ultimately become a fact. For Italy, the purely Venetian
      question could then also be settled, while the Italian, the national
      question, the question of right and honour which the army prizes so much,
      would still remain to be solved.

      GONZAGA, July 12, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      Travelling is generally said to be troublesome, but travelling with and
      through brigades, divisions, and army corps, I can certify to be more so
      than is usually agreeable. It is not that Italian officers or Italian
      soldiers are in any way disposed to throw obstacles in your way; but they,
      unhappily for you, have with them the inevitable cars with the inevitable
      carmen, both of which are enough to make your blood freeze, though the
      barometer stands very high. What with their indolence, what with their
      number and the dust they made, I really thought they would drive me mad
      before I should reach Casalmaggiore on my way from Torre Malamberti. I
      started from the former place at three a.m., with beautiful weather,
      which, true to tradition, accompanied me all through my journey. Passing
      through San Giovanni in Croce, to which the headquarters of General
      Pianell had been transferred, I turned to the right in the direction of
      the Po, and began to have an idea of the wearisome sort of journey which I
      would have to make up to Casalmaggiore. On both sides of the way some
      regiments belonging to the rear division were still camped, and as I
      passed it was most interesting to see how busy they were cooking their
      ‘rancio,’ polishing their arms, and making the best of their time. The
      officers stood leisurely about gazing and staring at me, supposing, as I
      thought, that I was travelling with some part in the destiny of their
      country. Here and there some soldiers who had just left the hospitals of
      Brescia and Milan made their way to their corps and shook hands with their
      comrades, from whom only illness or the fortune of war had made them part.
      They seemed glad to see their old tent, their old drum, their old
      colour-sergeant, and also the flag they had carried to the battle and had
      not at any price allowed to be taken. I may state here, en passant, that
      as many as six flags were taken from the enemy in the first part of the
      day of Custozza, and were subsequently abandoned in the retreat, while of
      the Italians only one was lost to a regiment for a few minutes, when it
      was quickly retaken. This fact ought to be sufficient by itself to
      establish the bravery with which the soldiers fought on the 24th, and the
      bravery with which they will fight if, as they ardently wish; a new
      occasion is given to them.
    </p>
<p>
      As long as I had only met troops, either marching or camping on the road,
      all went well, but I soon found myself mixed with an interminable line of
      cars and the like, forming the military and the civil train of the moving
      army. Then it was that it needed as much patience to keep from jumping out
      of one’s carriage and from chastising the carrettieri, as they would
      persist in not making room for one, and being as dumb to one’s entreaties
      as a stone. When you had finished with one you had to deal with another,
      and you find them all as obstinate and as egotistical as they are from one
      end of the world to the other, whether it be on the Casalmaggiore road or
      in High Holborn. From time to time things seemed to proceed all right, and
      you thought yourself free from further trouble, but you soon found out
      your mistake, as an enormous ammunition car went smack into your path, as
      one wheel got entangled with another, and as imperturbable Signor
      Carrettiere evidently took delight at a fresh opportunity for stoppage,
      inaction, indolence, and sleep. I soon came to the conclusion that Italy
      would not be free when the Austrians had been driven away, for that
      another and a more formidable foe—an enemy to society and comfort,
      to men and horses, to mankind in general would have still to be beaten,
      expelled, annihilated, in the shape of the carrettiere. If you employ him,
      he robs you fifty times over; if you want him to drive quickly, he is sure
      to keep the animal from going at all; if, worse than all, you never think
      of him, or have just been plundered by him, he will not move an inch to
      oblige you. Surely the cholera is not the only pestilence a country may be
      visited with; and, should Cialdini ever go to Vienna, he might revenge
      Novara and the Spielberg by taking with him the carrettieri of the whole
      army.
    </p>
<p>
      At last Casalmaggiore hove in sight, and, when good fortune and the carmen
      permitted, I reached it. It was time! No iron-plated Jacob could ever have
      resisted another two miles’ journey in such company. At Casalmaggiore I
      branched off. There were, happily, two roads, and not the slightest reason
      or smallest argument were needed to make me choose that which my cauchemar
      had not chosen. They were passing the river at Casalmaggiore. I went, of
      course, for the same purpose, somewhere else. Any place was good enough—so
      I thought, at least, then. New adventures, new miseries awaited me—some
      carrettiere, or other, guessing that I was no friend of his, nor of the
      whole set of them, had thrown the jattatura on me.
    </p>
<p>
      I alighted at the Colombina, after four hours’ ride, to give the horses
      time to rest a little. The Albergo della Colombina was a great
      disappointment, for there was nothing there that could be eaten. I decided
      upon waiting most patiently, but most unlike a few cavalry officers, who,
      all covered with dust, and evidently as hungry and as thirsty as they
      could be, began to swear to their hearts’ content. In an hour some eggs
      and some salame, a kind of sausage, were brought up, and quickly disposed
      of. A young lieutenant of the thirtieth infantry regiment of the Pisa
      brigade took his place opposite, and we were soon engaged in conversation.
      He had been in the midst and worst part of the battle of Custozza, and had
      escaped being taken prisoner by what seemed a miracle. He told me how,
      when his regiment advanced on the Monte Croce position, which he
      practically described to me as having the form of an English pudding, they
      were fired upon by batteries both on their flanks and front. The
      lieutenant added, however, rather contemptuously, that they did not even
      bow before them, as the custom appears to be—that is, to lie down,
      as the Austrians were firing very badly. The cross-fire got, however, so
      tremendous that an order had to be given to keep down by the road to avoid
      being annihilated. The assault was given, the whole range of positions was
      taken, and kept too for hours, until the infallible rule of three to one,
      backed by batteries, grape, and canister, compelled them to retreat, which
      they did slowly and in order. It was then that their brigade commander,
      Major General Rey de Villarey, who, though a native of Mentone, had
      preferred remaining with his king from going over to the French after the
      cession, turning to his son, who was also his aide-de-camp, said in his
      dialect, ‘Now, my son, we must die both of us,’ and with a touch of the
      spurs was soon in front of the line and on the hill, where three bullets
      struck him almost at once dead. The horse of his son falling while
      following, his life was spared. My lieutenant at this moment was so
      overcome with hunger and fatigue that he fell down, and was thought to be
      dead. He was not so, however, and had enough life to hear, after the fight
      was over, the Austrian Jagers pass by, and again retire to their original
      positions, where their infantry was lying down, not dreaming for one
      moment of pursuing the Italians. Four of his soldiers—all
      Neapolitans he heard coming in search of him, while the bullets still
      hissed all round; and, as soon as he made a sign to them, they approached,
      and took him on their shoulders back to where was what remained of the
      regiment. It is highly creditable to Italian unity to hear an old
      Piedmontese officer praise the levies of the new provinces, and the
      lieutenant took delight in relating that another Neapolitan was in the
      fight standing by him, and firing as fast as he could, when a shell having
      burst near him, he disdainfully gave it a look, and did not even seek to
      save himself from the jattatura.
    </p>
<p>
      The gallant lieutenant had unfortunately to leave at last, and I was
      deprived of many an interesting tale and of a brave man’s company. I
      started, therefore, for Viadana, where I purposed passing the Po, the left
      bank of which the road was now following parallel with the stream. At
      Viadana, however, I found no bridge, as the military had demolished what
      existed only the day before, and so had to look out for in formation. As I
      was going about under the porticoes which one meets in almost all the
      villages in this neighbourhood, I was struck by the sight of an ancient
      and beautiful piece of art—for so it was—a Venetian mirror of
      Murano. It hung on the wall inside the village draper’s shop, and was
      readily shown me by the owner, who did not conceal the pride he had in
      possessing it. It was one of those mirrors one rarely meets with now,
      which were once so abundant in the old princes’ castles and palaces. It
      looked so deep and true, and the gilt frame was so light, and of such a
      purity and elegance, that it needed all my resolution to keep from buying
      it, though a bargain would not have been effected very easily. The mirror,
      however, had to be abandoned, as Dosalo, the nearest point for crossing
      the Po, was still seven miles distant. By this time the sun was out in all
      its force, and the heat was by no means agreeable. Then there was dust,
      too, as if the carrettieri had been passing in hundreds, so that the heat
      was almost unbearable. At last the Dosalo ferry was reached, the road
      leading to it was entered, and the carriage was, I thought, to be at once
      embarked, when a drove of oxen were discovered to have the precedence; and
      so I had to wait. This under such a sun, on a shadeless beach, and with
      the prospect of having to stay there for two hours at least, was by no
      means pleasant. It took three-quarters of an hour to put the oxen in the
      boat, it took half an hour to get them on the other shore, and another
      hour to have the ferry boat back. The panorama from the beach was
      splendid, the Po appeared in all the mighty power of his waters, and as
      you looked with the glass at oxen and trees on the other shore, they
      appeared to be clothed in all the colours of the rainbow, and as if
      belonging to another world. Several peasants were waiting for the boat
      near me, talking about the war and the Austrians, and swearing they would,
      if possible, annihilate some of the latter. I gave them the glass to look
      with, and I imagined that they had never seen one before, for they thought
      it highly wonderful to make out what the time was at the Luzzara Tower,
      three miles in a straight line on the other side. The revolver, too, was a
      subject of great admiration, and they kept turning, feeling, and staring
      at it, as if they could not make out which way the cartridges were put in.
      One of these peasants, however, was doing the grand with the others, and
      once on the subject of history related to all who would hear how he had
      been to St. Helena, which was right in the middle of Moscow, where it was
      so very cold that his nose had got to be as large as his head. The poor
      man was evidently mixing one night’s tale with that of the next one, a
      tale probably heard from the old Sindaco, who is at the same time the
      schoolmaster, the notary, and the highest municipal authority in the
      place.
    </p>
<p>
      I started in the ferry boat with them at last. While crossing they got to
      speak of the priests, and were all agreed, to put it in the mildest way,
      in thinking extremely little of them, and only differed as to what
      punishment they should like them to suffer.
    </p>
<p>
      On the side where we landed lay heaps of ammunition casks for the corps
      besieging Borgoforte. Others were conveyed upon cars by my friends the
      carrettieri, of whom it was decreed I should not be quit for some time to
      come. Entering Guastalla I found only a few artillery officers, evidently
      in charge of what we had seen carried along the route. Guastalla is a neat
      little town very proud of its statue of Duke Ferrante Gonzaga, and the
      Croce Rossa is a neat little inn, which may be proud of a smart young
      waiter, who actually discovered that, as I wanted to proceed to Luzzara, a
      few miles on, I had better stop till next morning, I did not take his
      advice, and was soon under the gate of Luzzara, a very neat little place,
      once one of the many possessions where the Gonzagas had a court, a palace,
      and a castle. The arms over the archway may still be seen, and would not
      be worth any notice but for a remarkable work of terracotta representing a
      crown of pines and pine leaves in a wonderful state of preservation. The
      whole is so artistically arranged and so natural, that one might believe
      it to be one of Luca della Robbia’s works. Luzzara has also a great tower,
      which I had seen in the distance from Dosalo, and the only albergo in the
      place gives you an excellent Italian dinner. The wine might please one of
      the greatest admirers of sherry, and if you are not given feather beds,
      the beds are at least clean like the rooms themselves. Here, as it was
      getting too dark, I decided upon stopping, a decision which gave me
      occasion to see one of the finest sunsets I ever saw. As I looked from the
      albergo I could see a gradation of colours, from the purple red to the
      deepest of sea blue, rising like an immense tent from the dark green of
      the trees and the fields, here and there dotted with little white houses,
      with their red roofs, while in front the Luzzara Tower rose majestically
      in the twilight. As the hour got later the colours deepened, and the lower
      end of the immense curtain gradually disappeared, while the stars and the
      planets began shining high above. A peasant was singing in a field near
      by, and the bells of a church were chiming in the distance. Both seemed to
      harmonise wonderfully. It was a scene of great loveliness.
    </p>
<p>
      At four a.m. I was up, and soon after on the road to Reggiolo, and then to
      Gonzaga. Here the vegetation gets to be more luxuriant, and every inch of
      ground contributes to the immense vastness of the whole. Nature is here in
      full perfection, and as even the telegraphic wire hangs leisurely down
      from tree to tree, instead of being stuck upon poles, you feel that the
      romantic aspect of the place is too beautiful to be encroached upon. All
      is peace, beauty, and happiness, all reveals to you that you are in Italy.
    </p>
<p>
      In Gonzaga, which only a few days ago belonged to the Austrians, the
      Italian tricolour is out of every window. As the former masters retired
      the new advanced; and when a detachment of Monferrato lancers entered the
      old castle town the joy of the inhabitants seemed to be almost bordering
      on delirium. The lancers soon left, however. The flag only remains.
    </p>
<p>
      July 11.
    </p>
<p>
      Cialdini began passing the Po on the 8th, and crossed at three points,
      i.e., Carbonara, Carbonarola, and Follonica. Beginning at three o’clock in
      the morning, he had finished crossing upon the two first pontoon bridges
      towards midnight on the 9th. The bridge thrown up at Follonica was still
      intact up to seven in the morning on the 10th, but the troops and the
      military and the civil train that remained followed the Po without
      crossing to Stellata, in the supposed direction of Ponte Lagoscura.
    </p>
<p>
      Yesterday guns were heard here at seven o’clock in the morning, and up to
      eleven o’clock, in the direction of Legnano, towards, I think, the Adige.
      The firing was lively, and of such a nature as to make one surmise that
      battle had been given. Perhaps the Austrians have awaited Cialdini under
      Legnano, or they have disputed the crossing of the Adige. Rovigo was
      abandoned by the Austrians in the night of the 9th and 10th. They have
      blown up the Rovigo and Boara fortresses, have destroyed the tete-de-pont
      on the Adige, and burnt all bridges. They may now seek to keep by the left
      side of this river up to Legnano, so as to get under the protection of the
      quadrilateral, in which case, if Cialdini can cross the river in time, the
      shock would be almost inevitable, and would be a reason for yesterday’s
      firing. They may also go by rail to Padua, when they would have Cialdini
      between them and the quadrilateral. In any case, if this general is quick,
      or if they are not too quick for him, according to possible instructions,
      a collision is difficult to be avoided.
    </p>
<p>
      Baron Ricasoli has left Florence for the camp, and all sorts of rumours
      are afloat as to the present state of negotiations as they appear
      unmistakably to exist. The opinions are, I think, divided in the high
      councils of the Crown, and the country is still anxious to know the result
      of this state of affairs. A splendid victory by Cialdini might at this
      moment solve many a difficulty. As it is, the war is prosecuted everywhere
      except by sea, for Garibaldi’s forces are slowly advancing in the Italian
      Tyrol, while the Austrians wait for them behind the walls of Landaro and
      Ampola. The Garibaldians’ advanced posts were, by the latest news, near
      Darso.
    </p>
<p>
      The news from Prussia is still contradictory; while the Italian press is
      unanimous in asking with the country that Cialdini should advance, meet
      the enemy, fight him, and rout him if possible. Italy’s wishes are
      entirely with him.
    </p>
<p>
      NOALE, NEAR TREVISO, July 17, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      From Lusia I followed General Medici’s division to Motta, where I left it,
      not without regret, however, as better companions could not easily be
      found, so kind were the officers and jovial the men. They are now encamped
      around Padua, and will to-morrow march on Treviso, where the Italian Light
      Horse have already arrived, if I judge so from their having left Noale on
      the 15th. From the right I hear that the advanced posts have proceeded as
      far as Mira on the Brenta, twenty kilometres from Venice itself, and that
      the first army corps is to concentrate opposite Chioggia. This corps has
      marched from Ferrara straight on to Rovigo, which the forward movement of
      the fourth, or Cialdini’s corps d’armee, had left empty of soldiers.
      General Pianell has still charge of it, and Major-General Cadalini,
      formerly at the head of the Siena brigade, replaces him in the command of
      his former division. General Pianell has under him the gallant Prince
      Amadeus, who has entirely recovered from his chest wound, and of whom the
      brigade of Lombardian grenadiers is as proud as ever. They could not wish
      for a more skilled commander, a better superior officer, and a more
      valiant soldier. Thus the troops who fought on the 24th June are kept in
      the second line, while the still fresh divisions under Cialdini march
      first, as fast as they can. This, however, is of no avail. The Italian
      outposts on the Piave have not yet crossed it, for the reason that they
      must keep distances with their regiments, but will do so as soon as these
      get nearer to the river. If it was not that this is always done in regular
      warfare, they could beat the country beyond the Piave for a good many
      miles without even seeing the shadow of an Austrian. To the simple
      private, who does not know of diplomatic imbroglios and of political
      considerations, this sudden retreat means an almost as sudden retracing of
      steps, because he remembers that this manoeuvre preceded both the attacks
      on Solferino and on Custozza by the Austrians. To the officer, however, it
      means nothing else than a fixed desire not to face the Italian army any
      more, and so it is to him a source of disappointment and despondency. He
      cannot bear to think that another battle is improbable, and may be excused
      if he is not in the best of humour when on this subject. This is the case
      not only with the officers but with the volunteers, who have left their
      homes and the comfort of their domestic life, not to be paraded at
      reviews, but to be sent against the enemy. There are hundreds of these in
      the regular army-in the cavalry especially, and the Aosta Lancers and the
      regiment of Guides are half composed of them. If you listen to them, there
      ought not to be the slightest doubt or hesitation as to crossing the
      Isongo and marching upon Vienna. May Heaven see their wishes accomplished,
      for, unless crushed by sheer force, Italy is quite decided to carry war
      into the enemy’s country.
    </p>
<p>
      The decisions of the French government are looked for here with great
      anxiety, and not a few men are found who predict them to be unfavourable
      to Italy. Still, it is hard for every one to believe that the French
      emperor will carry things to extremities, and increase the many
      difficulties Europe has already to contend with.
    </p>
<p>
      To-day there was a rumour at the mess table that the Austrians had
      abandoned Legnano, one of the four fortresses of the quadrilateral. I do
      not put much faith in it at present, but it is not improbable, as we may
      expect many strange things from the Vienna government. It would have been
      much better for them, since Archduke Albert spoke in eulogistic terms of
      the king, of his sons, and of his soldiers, while relating the action of
      the 24th, to have treated with Italy direct, thus securing peace, and
      perhaps friendship, from her. But the men who have ruled so despotically
      for years over Italian subjects cannot reconcile themselves to the idea
      that Italy has at last risen to be a nation, and they even take slyly an
      opportunity to throw new insult into her face. You can easily see that the
      old spirit is still struggling for empire; that the old contempt is still
      trying to make light of Italians; and that the old Metternich ideas are
      still fondly clung to. Does not this deserve another lesson? Does not this
      need another Sadowa to quiet down for ever? Yes; and it devolves upon
      Italy to do it. If so, let only Cialdini’s army alone, and the day may be
      nigh at hand when the king may tell the country that the task has been
      accomplished.
    </p>
<p>
      A talk on the present state of political affairs, and on the peculiar
      position of Italy, is the only subject worth notice in a letter from the
      camp. Everything else is at a standstill, and the movements of the fine
      army Cialdini now disposes of, about 150,000 men, are no longer full of
      interest. They may, perhaps, have some as regards an attack on Venice,
      because Austrian soldiers are still garrisoning it, and will be obliged to
      fight if they are assailed. It is hoped, if such is the case, that the
      beautiful queen of the Adriatic will be spared a scene of devastation, and
      that no new Haynau will be found to renew the deeds of Brescia and
      Vicenza.

<p>
      The king has not yet arrived, and it seems probable he will not come for
      some time, until indeed the day comes for Italian troops to make their
      triumphal entry into the city of the Doges.
    </p>
<p>
      The heat continues intense, and this explains the slowness in advancing.
      As yet no sickness has appeared, and it must be hoped that the troops will
      be healthy, as sickness tries the morale much more than half-a-dozen
      Custozzas.
    </p>
<p>
      P.S.—I had finished writing when an officer came rushing into the
      inn where I am staying and told me that he had just heard that an Italian
      patrol had met an Austrian one on the road out of the village, and routed
      it. This may or may not be true, but it was must curious to see how
      delighted every one was at the idea that they had found ‘them’ at last.
      They did not care much about the result of the engagement, which, as I
      said, was reported to have been favourable. All that they cared about was
      that they were close to the enemy. One cannot despair of an army which is
      animated with such spirits. You would think, from the joy which brightens
      the face of the soldiers you meet now about, that a victory had been
      announced for the Italian arms.

<p>
      DOLO, NEAR VENICE, July 20, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      I returned from Noale to Padua last evening, and late in the night I
      received the intimation at my quarters that cannon was heard in the
      direction of Venice. It was then black as in Dante’s hell, and raining and
      blowing with violence—one of those Italian storms which seem to
      awake all the earthly and heavenly elements of creation. There was no
      choice for it but to take to the saddle, and try to make for the front. No
      one who has not tried it can fancy what work it is to find one’s way along
      a road on which a whole corps d’amee is marching with an enormous materiel
      of war in a pitch dark night. This, however, is what your special
      correspondent was obliged to do. Fortunately enough, I had scarcely
      proceeded as far as Ponte di Brenta when I fell in with an officer of
      Cialdini’s staff, who was bound to the same destination, namely, Dolo. As
      we proceeded along the road under a continuous shower of rain, our eyes
      now and then dazzled by the bright serpent-like flashes of the lightning,
      we fell in with some battalion or squadron, which advanced carefully, as
      it was impossible for them as well as for us to discriminate between the
      road and the ditches which flank it, for all the landmarks, so familiar to
      our guides in the daytime, were in one dead level of blackness. So it was
      that my companion and myself, after stumbling into ditches and out of
      them, after knocking our horses’ heads against an ammunition car, or a
      party of soldiers sheltered under some big tree, found ourselves, after
      three hours’ ride, in this village of Dolo. By this time the storm had
      greatly abated in its violence, and the thunder was but faintly heard now
      and then at such a distance as to enable us distinctly to hear the roar of
      the guns. Our horses could scarcely get through the sticky black mud, into
      which the white suffocating dust of the previous days had been turned by
      one night’s rain. We, however, made our way to the parsonage of the
      village, for we had already made up our minds to ascend the steeple of the
      church to get a view of the surrounding country and a better hearing of
      the guns if possible. After a few words exchanged with the sexton—a
      staunch Italian, as he told us he was—we went up the ladder of the
      church spire. Once on the wooden platform, we could hear more distinctly
      the boom of the guns, which sounded like the broadsides of a big vessel.
      Were they the guns of Persano’s long inactive fleet attacking some of
      Brondolo’s or Chioggia’s advanced forts? Were the guns those of some
      Austrian man-of-war which had engaged an Italian ironclad; or were they
      the ‘Affondatore,’ which left the Thames only a month ago, pitching into
      Trieste? To tell the truth, although we patiently waited two long hours on
      Dolo church spire, when both I and my companion descended we were not in a
      position to solve either of these problems. We, however, thought then, and
      still think, they were the guns of the Italian fleet which had attacked an
      Austrian fort.

      CIVITA VECCHIA, July 22, 1866.
    </p>
<p>
      Since the departure from this port of the old hospital ship ‘Gregeois’ 
      about a year ago, no French ship of war had been stationed at Civita
      Vecchia; but on Wednesday morning the steam-sloop ‘Catinat,’ 180 men, cast
      anchor in the harbour, and the commandant immediately on disembarking took
      the train for Rome and placed himself in communication with the French
      ambassador. I am not aware whether the Pontifical government had applied
      for this vessel, or whether the sending it was a spontaneous attention on
      the part of the French emperor, but, at any rate, its arrival has proved a
      source of pleasure to His Holiness, as there is no knowing what may happen
      In troublous times like the present, and it is always good to have a
      retreat insured.
    </p>
<p>
      Yesterday it was notified in this port, as well as at Naples, that
      arrivals from Marseilles would be, until further notice, subjected to a
      quarantine of fifteen days in consequence of cholera having made its
      appearance at the latter place. A sailing vessel which arrived from
      Marseilles in the course of the day had to disembark the merchandise it
      brought for Civita Vecchia into barges off the lazaretto, where the yellow
      flag was hoisted over them. This vessel left Marseilles five days before
      the announcement of the quarantine, while the ‘Prince Napoleon’ of
      Valery’s Company, passenger and merchandise steamer, which left Marseilles
      only one day before its announcement, was admitted this morning to free
      pratique. Few travellers will come here by sea now.
    </p>
<p>
      MARSEILLES, July 24.
    </p>
<p>
      Accustomed as we have been of late in Italy to almost hourly bulletins of
      the progress of hostilities, it is a trying condition to be suddenly
      debarred of all intelligence by finding oneself on board a steamer for
      thirty-six hours without touching at any port, as was my case in coming
      here from Civita Vecchia on board the ‘Prince Napoleon.’ But, although
      telegrams were wanting, discussions on the course of events were rife on
      board among the passengers who had embarked at Naples and Civita Vecchia,
      comprising a strong batch of French and Belgian priests returning from a
      pilgrimage to Rome, well supplied with rosaries and chaplets blessed by
      the Pope and facsimiles of the chains of St. Peter. Not much sympathy for
      the Italian cause was shown by these gentlemen or the few French and
      German travellers who, with three or four Neapolitans, formed the
      quarterdeck society; and our Corsican captain took no pains to hide his
      contempt at the dilatory proceedings of the Italian fleet at Ancona. We
      know that the Prussian minister, M. d’Usedom, has been recently making
      strenuous remonstrances at Ferrara against the slowness with which the
      Italian naval and military forces were proceeding, while their allies, the
      Prussians, were already near the gates of Vienna; and the conversation of
      a Prussian gentleman on board our steamer, who was connected with that
      embassy, plainly indicated the disappointment felt at Berlin at the rather
      inefficacious nature of the diversion made in Venetia, and on the coast of
      Istria by the army and navy of Victor Emmanuel. He even attributed to his
      minister an expression not very flattering either to the future prospects
      of Italy as resulting from her alliance with Prussia, or to the fidelity
      of the latter in carrying out the terms of it. I do not know whether this
      gentleman intended his anecdote to be taken cum grano salis, but I
      certainly understood him to say that he had deplored to the minister the
      want of vigour and the absence of success accompanying the operations of
      the Italian allies of Prussia, when His Excellency replied: ‘C’est bien
      vrai. Ils nous ont tromps; mais que voulez-vous y faire maintenant? Nous
      aurons le temps de les faire egorger apres.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      It is difficult to suppose that there should exist a preconceived
      intention on the part of Prussia to repay the sacrifices hitherto made,
      although without a very brilliant accompaniment of success, by the Italian
      government in support of the alliance, by making her own separate terms
      with Austria and leaving Italy subsequently exposed to the vengeance of
      the latter, but such would certainly be the inference to be drawn from the
      conversation just quoted.
    </p>
<p>
      It was only on arriving in the port of Marseilles, however, that the full
      enmity of most of my travelling companions towards Italy and the Italians
      was manifested. A sailor, the first man who came on board before we
      disembarked, was immediately pounced upon for news, and he gave it as
      indeed nothing less than the destruction, more or less complete, of the
      Italian fleet by that of the Austrians. At this astounding intelligence
      the Prussian burst into a yell of indignation. ‘Fools! blockheads!
      miserables! Beaten at sea by an inferior force! Is that the way they mean
      to reconquer Venice by dint of arms? If ever they do regain Venetia it
      will be through the blood of our Brandenburghers and Pomeranians, and not
      their own.’ During this tirade a little old Belgian in black, with the
      chain of St. Peter at his buttonhole by way of watchguard, capered off to
      communicate the grateful news to a group of his ecclesiastical
      fellow-travellers, shrieking out in ecstasy:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rosses, Messieurs! Ces blagueurs d’Italiens ont ete rosses par mer, comme
      ils avaient ete rosses par terre.’ Whereupon the reverend gentlemen
      congratulated each other with nods, and winks, and smiles, and sundry
      fervent squeezes of the hand. The same demonstrations would doubtless have
      been made by the Neapolitan passengers had they belonged to the Bourbonic
      faction, but they happened to be honest traders with cases of coral and
      lava for the Paris market, and therefore they merely stood silent and
      aghast at the fatal news, with their eyes and mouths as wide open as
      possible. I had no sooner got to my hotel than I inquired for the latest
      Paris journal, when the France was handed me, and I obtained confirmation
      in a certain degree of the disaster to the Italian fleet narrated by the
      sailor, although not quite in the same formidable proportions.
    </p>
<p>
      Before quitting the subject of my fellow-passengers on board the ‘Prince
      Napoleon’ I must mention an anecdote related to me, respecting the state
      of brigandage, by a Russian or German gentleman, who told me he was
      established at Naples. He was complaining of the dangers he had
      occasionally encountered in crossing in a diligence from Naples to Foggia
      on business; and then, speaking of the audacity of brigands in general, he
      told me that last year he saw with his own eyes; in broad daylight, two
      brigands walking about the streets of Naples with messages from captured
      individuals to their relations, mentioning the sums which had been
      demanded for their ransoms. They were unarmed, and in the common peasants’ 
      dresses, and whenever they arrived at one of the houses to which they were
      addressed for this purpose, they stopped and opened a handkerchief which
      one of them carried in his hand, and took out an ear, examining whether
      the ticket on it corresponded with the address of the house or the name of
      the resident. There were six ears, all ticketed with the names of the
      original owners in the handkerchief, which were gradually dispensed to
      their families in Naples to stimulate: prompt payment of the required
      ransoms. On my inquiring how it was that the police took no notice of such
      barefaced operations, my informant told me that, previous to the arrival
      of these brigand emissaries in town, the chief always wrote to the police
      authorities warning them against interfering with them, as the messengers
      were always followed by spies in plain clothes belonging to the band who
      would immediately report any molestation they might encounter in the
      discharge of their delicate mission, and the infallible result of such
      molestation would be first the putting to death of all the hostages held
      for ransom; and next, the summary execution of several members of
      gendarmery and police force captured in various skirmishes by the
      brigands, and held as prisoners of war.
    </p>
<p>
      Such audacity would seem incredible if we had not heard and read of so
      many similar instances of late.

<h2>
      ON THE IDEA OF COMEDY AND OF THE USES OF THE COMIC SPIRIT {1}
    </h2>
<p>
      [This etext was prepared from the 1897 Archibald Constable and Company
      edition by David Price]
    </p>
<p>
      Good Comedies are such rare productions, that notwithstanding the wealth
      of our literature in the Comic element, it would not occupy us long to run
      over the English list. If they are brought to the test I shall propose,
      very reputable Comedies will be found unworthy of their station, like the
      ladies of Arthur’s Court when they were reduced to the ordeal of the
      mantle.
    </p>
<p>
      There are plain reasons why the Comic poet is not a frequent apparition;
      and why the great Comic poet remains without a fellow. A society of
      cultivated men and women is required, wherein ideas are current and the
      perceptions quick, that he may be supplied with matter and an audience.
      The semi-barbarism of merely giddy communities, and feverish emotional
      periods, repel him; and also a state of marked social inequality of the
      sexes; nor can he whose business is to address the mind be understood
      where there is not a moderate degree of intellectual activity.
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, to touch and kindle the mind through laughter, demands more than
      sprightliness, a most subtle delicacy. That must be a natal gift in the
      Comic poet. The substance he deals with will show him a startling
      exhibition of the dyer’s hand, if he is without it. People are ready to
      surrender themselves to witty thumps on the back, breast, and sides; all
      except the head: and it is there that he aims. He must be subtle to
      penetrate. A corresponding acuteness must exist to welcome him. The
      necessity for the two conditions will explain how it is that we count him
      during centuries in the singular number.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘C’est une etrange entreprise que celle de faire rire les honnetes gens,’ 
      Moliere says; and the difficulty of the undertaking cannot be
      over-estimated.
    </p>
<p>
      Then again, he is beset with foes to right and left, of a character
      unknown to the tragic and the lyric poet, or even to philosophers.
    </p>
<p>
      We have in this world men whom Rabelais would call agelasts; that is to
      say, non-laughers; men who are in that respect as dead bodies, which if
      you prick them do not bleed. The old grey boulder-stone that has finished
      its peregrination from the rock to the valley, is as easily to be set
      rolling up again as these men laughing. No collision of circumstances in
      our mortal career strikes a light for them. It is but one step from being
      agelastic to misogelastic, and the [Greek text which cannot be
      reproduced], the laughter-hating, soon learns to dignify his dislike as an
      objection in morality.
    </p>
<p>
      We have another class of men, who are pleased to consider themselves
      antagonists of the foregoing, and whom we may term hypergelasts; the
      excessive laughers, ever-laughing, who are as clappers of a bell, that may
      be rung by a breeze, a grimace; who are so loosely put together that a
      wink will shake them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘... C’est n’estimer rien qu’estioner tout le monde,’ 
    </p>
<p>
      and to laugh at everything is to have no appreciation of the Comic of
      Comedy.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither of these distinct divisions of non-laughers and over-laughers
      would be entertained by reading The Rape of the Lock, or seeing a
      performance of Le Tartuffe. In relation to the stage, they have taken in
      our land the form and title of Puritan and Bacchanalian. For though the
      stage is no longer a public offender, and Shakespeare has been revived on
      it, to give it nobility, we have not yet entirely raised it above the
      contention of these two parties. Our speaking on the theme of Comedy will
      appear almost a libertine proceeding to one, while the other will think
      that the speaking of it seriously brings us into violent contrast with the
      subject.
    </p>
<p>
      Comedy, we have to admit, was never one of the most honoured of the Muses.
      She was in her origin, short of slaughter, the loudest expression of the
      little civilization of men. The light of Athene over the head of Achilles
      illuminates the birth of Greek Tragedy. But Comedy rolled in shouting
      under the divine protection of the Son of the Wine-jar, as Dionysus is
      made to proclaim himself by Aristophanes. Our second Charles was the
      patron, of like benignity, of our Comedy of Manners, which began similarly
      as a combative performance, under a licence to deride and outrage the
      Puritan, and was here and there Bacchanalian beyond the Aristophanic
      example: worse, inasmuch as a cynical licentiousness is more abominable
      than frank filth. An eminent Frenchman judges from the quality of some of
      the stuff dredged up for the laughter of men and women who sat through an
      Athenian Comic play, that they could have had small delicacy in other
      affairs when they had so little in their choice of entertainment. Perhaps
      he does not make sufficient allowance for the regulated licence of plain
      speaking proper to the festival of the god, and claimed by the Comic poet
      as his inalienable right, or for the fact that it was a festival in a
      season of licence, in a city accustomed to give ear to the boldest
      utterance of both sides of a case. However that may be, there can be no
      question that the men and women who sat through the acting of Wycherley’s
      Country Wife were past blushing. Our tenacity of national impressions has
      caused the word theatre since then to prod the Puritan nervous system like
      a satanic instrument; just as one has known Anti-Papists, for whom
      Smithfield was redolent of a sinister smoke, as though they had a later
      recollection of the place than the lowing herds. Hereditary Puritanism,
      regarding the stage, is met, to this day, in many families quite
      undistinguished by arrogant piety. It has subsided altogether as a power
      in the profession of morality; but it is an error to suppose it extinct,
      and unjust also to forget that it had once good reason to hate, shun, and
      rebuke our public shows.
    </p>
<p>
      We shall find ourselves about where the Comic spirit would place us, if we
      stand at middle distance between the inveterate opponents and the
      drum-and-fife supporters of Comedy: ‘Comme un point fixe fait remarquer
      l’emportement des autres,’ as Pascal says. And were there more in this
      position, Comic genius would flourish.
    </p>
<p>
      Our English idea of a Comedy of Manners might be imaged in the person of a
      blowsy country girl—say Hoyden, the daughter of Sir Tunbelly Clumsy,
      who, when at home, ‘never disobeyed her father except in the eating of
      green gooseberries’—transforming to a varnished City madam; with a
      loud laugh and a mincing step; the crazy ancestress of an accountably
      fallen descendant. She bustles prodigiously and is punctually smart in her
      speech, always in a fluster to escape from Dulness, as they say the dogs
      on the Nile-banks drink at the river running to avoid the crocodile. If
      the monster catches her, as at times he does, she whips him to a froth, so
      that those who know Dulness only as a thing of ponderousness, shall fail
      to recognise him in that light and airy shape.
    </p>
<p>
      When she has frolicked through her five Acts to surprise you with the
      information that Mr. Aimwell is converted by a sudden death in the world
      outside the scenes into Lord Aimwell, and can marry the lady in the light
      of day, it is to the credit of her vivacious nature that she does not
      anticipate your calling her Farce. Five is dignity with a trailing robe;
      whereas one, two, or three Acts would be short skirts, and degrading.
      Advice has been given to householders, that they should follow up the shot
      at a burglar in the dark by hurling the pistol after it, so that if the
      bullet misses, the weapon may strike and assure the rascal he has it. The
      point of her wit is in this fashion supplemented by the rattle of her
      tongue, and effectively, according to the testimony of her admirers. Her
      wit is at once, like steam in an engine, the motive force and the warning
      whistle of her headlong course; and it vanishes like the track of steam
      when she has reached her terminus, never troubling the brains afterwards;
      a merit that it shares with good wine, to the joy of the Bacchanalians. As
      to this wit, it is warlike. In the neatest hands it is like the sword of
      the cavalier in the Mall, quick to flash out upon slight provocation, and
      for a similar office—to wound. Commonly its attitude is entirely
      pugilistic; two blunt fists rallying and countering. When harmless, as
      when the word ‘fool’ occurs, or allusions to the state of husband, it has
      the sound of the smack of harlequin’s wand upon clown, and is to the same
      extent exhilarating. Believe that idle empty laughter is the most
      desirable of recreations, and significant Comedy will seem pale and
      shallow in comparison. Our popular idea would be hit by the sculptured
      group of Laughter holding both his sides, while Comedy pummels, by way of
      tickling him. As to a meaning, she holds that it does not conduce to
      making merry: you might as well carry cannon on a racing-yacht. Morality
      is a duenna to be circumvented. This was the view of English Comedy of a
      sagacious essayist, who said that the end of a Comedy would often be the
      commencement of a Tragedy, were the curtain to rise again on the
      performers. In those old days female modesty was protected by a fan,
      behind which, and it was of a convenient semicircular breadth, the ladies
      present in the theatre retired at a signal of decorum, to peep, covertly
      askant, or with the option of so peeping, through a prettily fringed
      eyelet-hole in the eclipsing arch.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ego limis specto sic per flabellum clanculum.’-TERENCE.
    </p>
<p>
      That fan is the flag and symbol of the society giving us our so-called
      Comedy of Manners, or Comedy of the manners of South-sea Islanders under
      city veneer; and as to Comic idea, vacuous as the mask without the face
      behind it.

      Elia, whose humour delighted in floating a galleon paradox and wafting it
      as far as it would go, bewails the extinction of our artificial Comedy,
      like a poet sighing over the vanished splendour of Cleopatra’s Nile-barge;
      and the sedateness of his plea for a cause condemned even in his time to
      the penitentiary, is a novel effect of the ludicrous. When the realism of
      those ‘fictitious half-believed personages,’ as he calls them, had ceased
      to strike, they were objectionable company, uncaressable as puppets. Their
      artifices are staringly naked, and have now the effect of a painted face
      viewed, after warm hours of dancing, in the morning light. How could the
      Lurewells and the Plyants ever have been praised for ingenuity in
      wickedness? Critics, apparently sober, and of high reputation, held up
      their shallow knaveries for the world to admire. These Lurewells, Plyants,
      Pinchwifes, Fondlewifes, Miss Prue, Peggy, Hoyden, all of them save
      charming Milamant, are dead as last year’s clothes in a fashionable fine
      lady’s wardrobe, and it must be an exceptionably abandoned Abigail of our
      period that would look on them with the wish to appear in their likeness.
      Whether the puppet show of Punch and Judy inspires our street-urchins to
      have instant recourse to their fists in a dispute, after the fashion of
      every one of the actors in that public entertainment who gets possession
      of the cudgel, is open to question: it has been hinted; and angry
      moralists have traced the national taste for tales of crime to the smell
      of blood in our nursery-songs. It will at any rate hardly be questioned
      that it is unwholesome for men and women to see themselves as they are, if
      they are no better than they should be: and they will not, when they have
      improved in manners, care much to see themselves as they once were. That
      comes of realism in the Comic art; and it is not public caprice, but the
      consequence of a bettering state. {2} The same of an immoral may be said
      of realistic exhibitions of a vulgar society.
    </p>
<p>
      The French make a critical distinction in ce qui remue from ce qui emeut—that
      which agitates from that which touches with emotion. In the realistic
      comedy it is an incessant remuage—no calm, merely bustling figures,
      and no thought. Excepting Congreve’s Way of the World, which failed on the
      stage, there was nothing to keep our comedy alive on its merits; neither,
      with all its realism, true portraiture, nor much quotable fun, nor idea;
      neither salt nor soul.
    </p>
<p>
      The French have a school of stately comedy to which they can fly for
      renovation whenever they have fallen away from it; and their having such a
      school is mainly the reason why, as John Stuart Mill pointed out, they
      know men and women more accurately than we do. Moliere followed the
      Horatian precept, to observe the manners of his age and give his
      characters the colour befitting them at the time. He did not paint in raw
      realism. He seized his characters firmly for the central purpose of the
      play, stamped them in the idea, and by slightly raising and softening the
      object of study (as in the case of the ex-Huguenot, Duke de Montausier,
      {3} for the study of the Misanthrope, and, according to St. Simon, the
      Abbe Roquette for Tartuffe), generalized upon it so as to make it
      permanently human. Concede that it is natural for human creatures to live
      in society, and Alceste is an imperishable mark of one, though he is drawn
      in light outline, without any forcible human colouring. Our English school
      has not clearly imagined society; and of the mind hovering above
      congregated men and women, it has imagined nothing. The critics who praise
      it for its downrightness, and for bringing the situations home to us, as
      they admiringly say, cannot but disapprove of Moliere’s comedy, which
      appeals to the individual mind to perceive and participate in the social.
      We have splendid tragedies, we have the most beautiful of poetic plays,
      and we have literary comedies passingly pleasant to read, and occasionally
      to see acted. By literary comedies, I mean comedies of classic
      inspiration, drawn chiefly from Menander and the Greek New Comedy through
      Terence; or else comedies of the poet’s personal conception, that have had
      no model in life, and are humorous exaggerations, happy or otherwise.
      These are the comedies of Ben Jonson, Massinger, and Fletcher. Massinger’s
      Justice Greedy we can all of us refer to a type, ‘with fat capon lined’ 
      that has been and will be; and he would be comic, as Panurge is comic, but
      only a Rabelais could set him moving with real animation. Probably Justice
      Greedy would be comic to the audience of a country booth and to some of
      our friends. If we have lost our youthful relish for the presentation of
      characters put together to fit a type, we find it hard to put together the
      mechanism of a civil smile at his enumeration of his dishes. Something of
      the same is to be said of Bobadil, swearing ‘by the foot of Pharaoh’; with
      a reservation, for he is made to move faster, and to act. The comic of
      Jonson is a scholar’s excogitation of the comic; that of Massinger a
      moralist’s.
    </p>
<p>
      Shakespeare is a well-spring of characters which are saturated with the
      comic spirit; with more of what we will call blood-life than is to be
      found anywhere out of Shakespeare; and they are of this world, but they
      are of the world enlarged to our embrace by imagination, and by great
      poetic imagination. They are, as it were—I put it to suit my present
      comparison—creatures of the woods and wilds, not in walled towns,
      not grouped and toned to pursue a comic exhibition of the narrower world
      of society. Jaques, Falstaff and his regiment, the varied troop of Clowns,
      Malvolio, Sir Hugh Evans and Fluellen—marvellous Welshmen!—Benedict
      and Beatrice, Dogberry, and the rest, are subjects of a special study in
      the poetically comic.
    </p>
<p>
      His Comedy of incredible imbroglio belongs to the literary section. One
      may conceive that there was a natural resemblance between him and
      Menander, both in the scheme and style of his lighter plays. Had
      Shakespeare lived in a later and less emotional, less heroical period of
      our history, he might have turned to the painting of manners as well as
      humanity. Euripides would probably, in the time of Menander, when Athens
      was enslaved but prosperous, have lent his hand to the composition of
      romantic comedy. He certainly inspired that fine genius.
    </p>
<p>
      Politically it is accounted a misfortune for France that her nobles
      thronged to the Court of Louis Quatorze. It was a boon to the comic poet.
      He had that lively quicksilver world of the animalcule passions, the huge
      pretensions, the placid absurdities, under his eyes in full activity;
      vociferous quacks and snapping dupes, hypocrites, posturers, extravagants,
      pedants, rose-pink ladies and mad grammarians, sonneteering marquises,
      high-flying mistresses, plain-minded maids, inter-threading as in a loom,
      noisy as at a fair. A simply bourgeois circle will not furnish it, for the
      middle class must have the brilliant, flippant, independent upper for a
      spur and a pattern; otherwise it is likely to be inwardly dull as well as
      outwardly correct. Yet, though the King was benevolent toward Moliere, it
      is not to the French Court that we are indebted for his unrivalled studies
      of mankind in society. For the amusement of the Court the ballets and
      farces were written, which are dearer to the rabble upper, as to the
      rabble lower, class than intellectual comedy. The French bourgeoisie of
      Paris were sufficiently quick-witted and enlightened by education to
      welcome great works like Le Tartuffe, Les Femmes Savantes, and Le
      Misanthrope, works that were perilous ventures on the popular
      intelligence, big vessels to launch on streams running to shallows. The
      Tartuffe hove into view as an enemy’s vessel; it offended, not Dieu mais
      les devots, as the Prince de Conde explained the cabal raised against it
      to the King.
    </p>
<p>
      The Femmes Savantes is a capital instance of the uses of comedy in
      teaching the world to understand what ails it. The farce of the Precieuses
      ridiculed and put a stop to the monstrous romantic jargon made popular by
      certain famous novels. The comedy of the Femmes Savantes exposed the later
      and less apparent but more finely comic absurdity of an excessive purism
      in grammar and diction, and the tendency to be idiotic in precision. The
      French had felt the burden of this new nonsense; but they had to see the
      comedy several times before they were consoled in their suffering by
      seeing the cause of it exposed.
    </p>
<p>
      The Misanthrope was yet more frigidly received. Moliere thought it dead.
      ‘I cannot improve on it, and assuredly never shall,’ he said. It is one of
      the French titles to honour that this quintessential comedy of the
      opposition of Alceste and Celimene was ultimately understood and
      applauded. In all countries the middle class presents the public which,
      fighting the world, and with a good footing in the fight, knows the world
      best. It may be the most selfish, but that is a question leading us into
      sophistries. Cultivated men and women, who do not skim the cream of life,
      and are attached to the duties, yet escape the harsher blows, make acute
      and balanced observers. Moliere is their poet.
    </p>
<p>
      Of this class in England, a large body, neither Puritan nor Bacchanalian,
      have a sentimental objection to face the study of the actual world. They
      take up disdain of it, when its truths appear humiliating: when the facts
      are not immediately forced on them, they take up the pride of incredulity.
      They live in a hazy atmosphere that they suppose an ideal one. Humorous
      writing they will endure, perhaps approve, if it mingles with pathos to
      shake and elevate the feelings. They approve of Satire, because, like the
      beak of the vulture, it smells of carrion, which they are not. But of
      Comedy they have a shivering dread, for Comedy enfolds them with the
      wretched host of the world, huddles them with us all in an ignoble
      assimilation, and cannot be used by any exalted variety as a scourge and a
      broom. Nay, to be an exalted variety is to come under the calm curious eye
      of the Comic spirit, and be probed for what you are. Men are seen among
      them, and very many cultivated women. You may distinguish them by a
      favourite phrase: ‘Surely we are not so bad!’ and the remark: ‘If that is
      human nature, save us from it!’ as if it could be done: but in the
      peculiar Paradise of the wilful people who will not see, the exclamation
      assumes the saving grace.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet should you ask them whether they dislike sound sense, they vow they do
      not. And question cultivated women whether it pleases them to be shown
      moving on an intellectual level with men, they will answer that it does;
      numbers of them claim the situation. Now, Comedy is the fountain of sound
      sense; not the less perfectly sound on account of the sparkle: and Comedy
      lifts women to a station offering them free play for their wit, as they
      usually show it, when they have it, on the side of sound sense. The higher
      the Comedy, the more prominent the part they enjoy in it. Dorine in the
      Tartuffe is common-sense incarnate, though palpably a waiting-maid.
      Celimene is undisputed mistress of the same attribute in the Misanthrope;
      wiser as a woman than Alceste as man. In Congreve’s Way of the World,
      Millamant overshadows Mirabel, the sprightliest male figure of English
      comedy.
    </p>
<p>
      But those two ravishing women, so copious and so choice of speech, who
      fence with men and pass their guard, are heartless! Is it not preferable
      to be the pretty idiot, the passive beauty, the adorable bundle of
      caprices, very feminine, very sympathetic, of romantic and sentimental
      fiction? Our women are taught to think so. The Agnes of the Ecole des
      Femmes should be a lesson for men. The heroines of Comedy are like women
      of the world, not necessarily heartless from being clear-sighted: they
      seem so to the sentimentally-reared only for the reason that they use
      their wits, and are not wandering vessels crying for a captain or a pilot.
      Comedy is an exhibition of their battle with men, and that of men with
      them: and as the two, however divergent, both look on one object, namely,
      Life, the gradual similarity of their impressions must bring them to some
      resemblance. The Comic poet dares to show us men and women coming to this
      mutual likeness; he is for saying that when they draw together in social
      life their minds grow liker; just as the philosopher discerns the
      similarity of boy and girl, until the girl is marched away to the nursery.
      Philosopher and Comic poet are of a cousinship in the eye they cast on
      life: and they are equally unpopular with our wilful English of the hazy
      region and the ideal that is not to be disturbed.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, for want of instruction in the Comic idea, we lose a large audience
      among our cultivated middle class that we should expect to support Comedy.
      The sentimentalist is as averse as the Puritan and as the Bacchanalian.
    </p>
<p>
      Our traditions are unfortunate. The public taste is with the idle
      laughers, and still inclines to follow them. It may be shown by an
      analysis of Wycherley’s Plain Dealer, a coarse prose adaption of the
      Misanthrope, stuffed with lumps of realism in a vulgarized theme to hit
      the mark of English appetite, that we have in it the keynote of the Comedy
      of our stage. It is Moliere travestied, with the hoof to his foot and hair
      on the pointed tip of his ear. And how difficult it is for writers to
      disentangle themselves from bad traditions is noticeable when we find
      Goldsmith, who had grave command of the Comic in narrative, producing an
      elegant farce for a Comedy; and Fielding, who was a master of the Comic
      both in narrative and in dialogue, not even approaching to the presentable
      in farce.
    </p>
<p>
      These bad traditions of Comedy affect us not only on the stage, but in our
      literature, and may be tracked into our social life. They are the ground
      of the heavy moralizings by which we are outwearied, about Life as a
      Comedy, and Comedy as a jade, {4} when popular writers, conscious of
      fatigue in creativeness, desire to be cogent in a modish cynicism:
      perversions of the idea of life, and of the proper esteem for the society
      we have wrested from brutishness, and would carry higher. Stock images of
      this description are accepted by the timid and the sensitive, as well as
      by the saturnine, quite seriously; for not many look abroad with their own
      eyes, fewer still have the habit of thinking for themselves. Life, we know
      too well, is not a Comedy, but something strangely mixed; nor is Comedy a
      vile mask. The corrupted importation from France was noxious; a noble
      entertainment spoilt to suit the wretched taste of a villanous age; and
      the later imitations of it, partly drained of its poison and made
      decorous, became tiresome, notwithstanding their fun, in the perpetual
      recurring of the same situations, owing to the absence of original study
      and vigour of conception. Scene v. Act 2 of the Misanthrope, owing, no
      doubt, to the fact of our not producing matter for original study, is
      repeated in succession by Wycherley, Congreve, and Sheridan, and as it is
      at second hand, we have it done cynically—or such is the tone; in
      the manner of ‘below stairs.’ Comedy thus treated may be accepted as a
      version of the ordinary worldly understanding of our social life; at
      least, in accord with the current dicta concerning it. The epigrams can be
      made; but it is uninstructive, rather tending to do disservice. Comedy
      justly treated, as you find it in Moliere, whom we so clownishly
      mishandled, the Comedy of Moliere throws no infamous reflection upon life.
      It is deeply conceived, in the first place, and therefore it cannot be
      impure. Meditate on that statement. Never did man wield so shrieking a
      scourge upon vice, but his consummate self-mastery is not shaken while
      administering it. Tartuffe and Harpagon, in fact, are made each to whip
      himself and his class, the false pietists, and the insanely covetous.
      Moliere has only set them in motion. He strips Folly to the skin, displays
      the imposture of the creature, and is content to offer her better
      clothing, with the lesson Chrysale reads to Philaminte and Belise. He
      conceives purely, and he writes purely, in the simplest language, the
      simplest of French verse. The source of his wit is clear reason: it is a
      fountain of that soil; and it springs to vindicate reason, common-sense,
      rightness and justice; for no vain purpose ever. The wit is of such
      pervading spirit that it inspires a pun with meaning and interest. {5} His
      moral does not hang like a tail, or preach from one character incessantly
      cocking an eye at the audience, as in recent realistic French Plays: but
      is in the heart of his work, throbbing with every pulsation of an organic
      structure. If Life is likened to the comedy of Moliere, there is no
      scandal in the comparison.
    </p>
<p>
      Congreve’s Way of the World is an exception to our other comedies, his own
      among them, by virtue of the remarkable brilliancy of the writing, and the
      figure of Millamant. The comedy has no idea in it, beyond the stale one,
      that so the world goes; and it concludes with the jaded discovery of a
      document at a convenient season for the descent of the curtain. A plot was
      an afterthought with Congreve. By the help of a wooden villain (Maskwell)
      marked Gallows to the flattest eye, he gets a sort of plot in The Double
      Dealer. {6} His Way of the World might be called The Conquest of a Town
      Coquette, and Millamant is a perfect portrait of a coquette, both in her
      resistance to Mirabel and the manner of her surrender, and also in her
      tongue. The wit here is not so salient as in certain passages of Love for
      Love, where Valentine feigns madness or retorts on his father, or Mrs.
      Frail rejoices in the harmlessness of wounds to a woman’s virtue, if she
      ‘keeps them from air.’ In The Way of the World, it appears less prepared
      in the smartness, and is more diffused in the more characteristic style of
      the speakers. Here, however, as elsewhere, his famous wit is like a
      bully-fencer, not ashamed to lay traps for its exhibition, transparently
      petulant for the train between certain ordinary words and the
      powder-magazine of the improprieties to be fired. Contrast the wit of
      Congreve with Moliere’s. That of the first is a Toledo blade, sharp, and
      wonderfully supple for steel; cast for duelling, restless in the scabbard,
      being so pretty when out of it. To shine, it must have an adversary.
      Moliere’s wit is like a running brook, with innumerable fresh lights on it
      at every turn of the wood through which its business is to find a way. It
      does not run in search of obstructions, to be noisy over them; but when
      dead leaves and viler substances are heaped along the course, its natural
      song is heightened. Without effort, and with no dazzling flashes of
      achievement, it is full of healing, the wit of good breeding, the wit of
      wisdom.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Genuine humour and true wit,’ says Landor, {7} ‘require a sound and
      capacious mind, which is always a grave one. Rabelais and La Fontaine are
      recorded by their countrymen to have been reveurs. Few men have been
      graver than Pascal. Few men have been wittier.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      To apply the citation of so great a brain as Pascal’s to our countryman
      would be unfair. Congreve had a certain soundness of mind; of capacity, in
      the sense intended by Landor, he had little. Judging him by his wit, he
      performed some happy thrusts, and taking it for genuine, it is a surface
      wit, neither rising from a depth nor flowing from a spring.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On voit qu’il se travaille e dire de bons mots.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      He drives the poor hack word, ‘fool,’ as cruelly to the market for wit as
      any of his competitors. Here is an example, that has been held up for
      eulogy:
    </p>
<p>
      WITWOUD: He has brought me a letter from the fool my brother, etc. etc.
    </p>
<p>
      MIRABEL: A fool, and your brother, Witwoud?
    </p>
<p>
      WITWOUD: Ay, ay, my half-brother. My half-brother he is; no nearer, upon
      my honour.
    </p>
<p>
      MIRABEL: Then ‘tis possible he may be but half a fool.
    </p>
<p>
      By evident preparation. This is a sort of wit one remembers to have heard
      at school, of a brilliant outsider; perhaps to have been guilty of
      oneself, a trifle later. It was, no doubt, a blaze of intellectual
      fireworks to the bumpkin squire, who came to London to go to the theatre
      and learn manners.
    </p>
<p>
      Where Congreve excels all his English rivals is in his literary force, and
      a succinctness of style peculiar to him. He had correct judgement, a
      correct ear, readiness of illustration within a narrow range, in snapshots
      of the obvious at the obvious, and copious language. He hits the mean of a
      fine style and a natural in dialogue. He is at once precise and voluble.
      If you have ever thought upon style you will acknowledge it to be a signal
      accomplishment. In this he is a classic, and is worthy of treading a
      measure with Moliere. The Way of the World may be read out currently at a
      first glance, so sure are the accents of the emphatic meaning to strike
      the eye, perforce of the crispness and cunning polish of the sentences.
      You have not to look over them before you confide yourself to him; he will
      carry you safe. Sheridan imitated, but was far from surpassing him. The
      flow of boudoir Billingsgate in Lady Wishfort is unmatched for the vigour
      and pointedness of the tongue. It spins along with a final ring, like the
      voice of Nature in a fury, and is, indeed, racy eloquence of the elevated
      fishwife.
    </p>
<p>
      Millamant is an admirable, almost a lovable heroine. It is a piece of
      genius in a writer to make a woman’s manner of speech portray her. You
      feel sensible of her presence in every line of her speaking. The
      stipulations with her lover in view of marriage, her fine lady’s delicacy,
      and fine lady’s easy evasions of indelicacy, coquettish airs, and playing
      with irresolution, which in a common maid would be bashfulness, until she
      submits to ‘dwindle into a wife,’ as she says, form a picture that lives
      in the frame, and is in harmony with Mirabel’s description of her:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Here she comes, i’ faith, full sail, with her fan spread, and her
      streamers out, and a shoal of fools for tenders.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And, after an interview:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Think of you! To think of a whirlwind, though ‘twere in a whirlwind, were
      a case of more steady contemplation, a very tranquillity of mind and
      mansion.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      There is a picturesqueness, as of Millamant and no other, in her voice,
      when she is encouraged to take Mirabel by Mrs. Fainall, who is ‘sure she
      has a mind to him’:
    </p>
<p>
      MILLAMANT: Are you? I think I have—and the horrid man looks as if he
      thought so too, etc. etc.
    </p>
<p>
      One hears the tones, and sees the sketch and colour of the whole scene in
      reading it.
    </p>
<p>
      Celimene is behind Millamant in vividness. An air of bewitching
      whimsicality hovers over the graces of this Comic heroine, like the lively
      conversational play of a beautiful mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      But in wit she is no rival of Celimene. What she utters adds to her
      personal witchery, and is not further memorable. She is a flashing
      portrait, and a type of the superior ladies who do not think, not of those
      who do. In representing a class, therefore, it is a lower class, in the
      proportion that one of Gainsborough’s full-length aristocratic women is
      below the permanent impressiveness of a fair Venetian head.
    </p>
<p>
      Millamant side by side with Celimene is an example of how far the
      realistic painting of a character can be carried to win our favour; and of
      where it falls short. Celimene is a woman’s mind in movement, armed with
      an ungovernable wit; with perspicacious clear eyes for the world, and a
      very distinct knowledge that she belongs to the world, and is most at home
      in it. She is attracted to Alceste by her esteem for his honesty; she
      cannot avoid seeing where the good sense of the man is diseased.
    </p>
<p>
      Rousseau, in his letter to D’Alembert on the subject of the Misanthrope,
      discusses the character of Alceste, as though Moliere had put him forth
      for an absolute example of misanthropy; whereas Alceste is only a
      misanthrope of the circle he finds himself placed in: he has a touching
      faith in the virtue residing in the country, and a critical love of sweet
      simpleness. Nor is he the principal person of the comedy to which he gives
      a name. He is only passively comic. Celimene is the active spirit. While
      he is denouncing and railing, the trial is imposed upon her to make the
      best of him, and control herself, as much as a witty woman, eagerly
      courted, can do. By appreciating him she practically confesses her
      faultiness, and she is better disposed to meet him half.way than he is to
      bend an inch: only she is une ame de vingt ans, the world is pleasant, and
      if the gilded flies of the Court are silly, uncompromising fanatics have
      their ridiculous features as well. Can she abandon the life they make
      agreeable to her, for a man who will not be guided by the common sense of
      his class; and who insists on plunging into one extreme—equal to
      suicide in her eyes—to avoid another? That is the comic question of
      the Misanthrope. Why will he not continue to mix with the world smoothly,
      appeased by the flattery of her secret and really sincere preference of
      him, and taking his revenge in satire of it, as she does from her own not
      very lofty standard, and will by and by do from his more exalted one?
    </p>
<p>
      Celimene is worldliness: Alceste is unworldliness. It does not quite imply
      unselfishness; and that is perceived by her shrewd head. Still he is a
      very uncommon figure in her circle, and she esteems him, l’homme aux
      rubans verts, ‘who sometimes diverts but more often horribly vexes her,’ 
      as she can say of him when her satirical tongue is on the run. Unhappily
      the soul of truth in him, which wins her esteem, refuses to be tamed, or
      silent, or unsuspicious, and is the perpetual obstacle to their good
      accord. He is that melancholy person, the critic of everybody save
      himself; intensely sensitive to the faults of others, wounded by them; in
      love with his own indubitable honesty, and with his ideal of the simpler
      form of life befitting it: qualities which constitute the satirist. He is
      a Jean Jacques of the Court. His proposal to Celimene when he pardons her,
      that she should follow him in flying humankind, and his frenzy of
      detestation of her at her refusal, are thoroughly in the mood of Jean
      Jacques. He is an impracticable creature of a priceless virtue; but
      Celimene may feel that to fly with him to the desert: that is from the
      Court to the country
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ou d’etre homme d’honneur on ait la liberte,’ 
    </p>
<p>
      she is likely to find herself the companion of a starving satirist, like
      that poor princess who ran away with the waiting-man, and when both were
      hungry in the forest, was ordered to give him flesh. She is a fieffee
      coquette, rejoicing in her wit and her attractions, and distinguished by
      her inclination for Alceste in the midst of her many other lovers; only
      she finds it hard to cut them off—what woman with a train does not?—and
      when the exposure of her naughty wit has laid her under their rebuke, she
      will do the utmost she can: she will give her hand to honesty, but she
      cannot quite abandon worldliness. She would be unwise if she did.
    </p>
<p>
      The fable is thin. Our pungent contrivers of plots would see no indication
      of life in the outlines. The life of the comedy is in the idea. As with
      the singing of the sky-lark out of sight, you must love the bird to be
      attentive to the song, so in this highest flight of the Comic Muse, you
      must love pure Comedy warmly to understand the Misanthrope: you must be
      receptive of the idea of Comedy. And to love Comedy you must know the real
      world, and know men and women well enough not to expect too much of them,
      though you may still hope for good.
    </p>
<p>
      Menander wrote a comedy called Misogynes, said to have been the most
      celebrated of his works. This misogynist is a married man, according to
      the fragment surviving, and is a hater of women through hatred of his
      wife. He generalizes upon them from the example of this lamentable adjunct
      of his fortunes, and seems to have got the worst of it in the contest with
      her, which is like the issue in reality, in the polite world. He seems
      also to have deserved it, which may be as true to the copy. But we are
      unable to say whether the wife was a good voice of her sex: or how far
      Menander in this instance raised the idea of woman from the mire it was
      plunged into by the comic poets, or rather satiric dramatists, of the
      middle period of Greek Comedy preceding him and the New Comedy, who
      devoted their wit chiefly to the abuse, and for a diversity, to the eulogy
      of extra-mural ladies of conspicuous fame. Menander idealized them without
      purposely elevating. He satirized a certain Thais, and his Thais of the
      Eunuchus of Terence is neither professionally attractive nor repulsive;
      his picture of the two Andrians, Chrysis and her sister, is nowhere to be
      matched for tenderness. But the condition of honest women in his day did
      not permit of the freedom of action and fencing dialectic of a Celimene,
      and consequently it is below our mark of pure Comedy.
    </p>
<p>
      Sainte-Beuve conjures up the ghost of Menander, saying: For the love of me
      love Terence. It is through love of Terence that moderns are able to love
      Menander; and what is preserved of Terence has not apparently given us the
      best of the friend of Epicurus. [Greek text which cannot be reproduced]
      the lover taken in horror, and [Greek text] the damsel shorn of her locks,
      have a promising sound for scenes of jealousy and a too masterful display
      of lordly authority, leading to regrets, of the kind known to intemperate
      men who imagined they were fighting with the weaker, as the fragments
      indicate.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the six comedies of Terence, four are derived from Menander; two, the
      Hecyra and the Phormio, from Apollodorus. These two are inferior in comic
      action and the peculiar sweetness of Menander to the Andria, the Adelphi,
      the Heautontimorumenus, and the Eunuchus: but Phormio is a more dashing
      and amusing convivial parasite than the Gnatho of the last-named comedy.
      There were numerous rivals of whom we know next to nothing—except by
      the quotations of Athenaeus and Plutarch, and the Greek grammarians who
      cited them to support a dictum—in this as in the preceding periods
      of comedy in Athens, for Menander’s plays are counted by many scores, and
      they were crowned by the prize only eight times. The favourite poet with
      critics, in Greece as in Rome, was Menander; and if some of his rivals
      here and there surpassed him in comic force, and out-stripped him in
      competition by an appositeness to the occasion that had previously in the
      same way deprived the genius of Aristophanes of its due reward in Clouds
      and Birds, his position as chief of the comic poets of his age was
      unchallenged. Plutarch very unnecessarily drags Aristophanes into a
      comparison with him, to the confusion of the older poet. Their aims, the
      matter they dealt in, and the times, were quite dissimilar. But it is no
      wonder that Plutarch, writing when Athenian beauty of style was the
      delight of his patrons, should rank Menander at the highest. In what
      degree of faithfulness Terence copied Menander, whether, as he states of
      the passage in the Adelphi taken from Diphilus, verbum de verbo in the
      lovelier scenes—the description of the last words of the dying
      Andrian, and of her funeral, for instance—remains conjectural. For
      us Terence shares with his master the praise of an amenity that is like
      Elysian speech, equable and ever gracious; like the face of the Andrian’s
      young sister:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Adeo modesto, adeo venusto, ut nihil supra.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The celebrated ‘flens quam familiariter,’ of which the closest rendering
      grounds hopelessly on harsh prose, to express the sorrowful confidingness
      of a young girl who has lost her sister and dearest friend, and has but
      her lover left to her; ‘she turned and flung herself on his bosom, weeping
      as though at home there’: this our instinct tells us must be Greek, though
      hardly finer in Greek. Certain lines of Terence, compared with the
      original fragments, show that he embellished them; but his taste was too
      exquisite for him to do other than devote his genius to the honest
      translation of such pieces as the above. Menander, then; with him, through
      the affinity of sympathy, Terence; and Shakespeare and Moliere have this
      beautiful translucency of language: and the study of the comic poets might
      be recommended, if for that only.
    </p>
<p>
      A singular ill fate befell the writings of Menander. What we have of him
      in Terence was chosen probably to please the cultivated Romans; {8} and is
      a romantic play with a comic intrigue, obtained in two instances, the
      Andria and the Eunuchus, by rolling a couple of his originals into one.
      The titles of certain of the lost plays indicate the comic illumining
      character; a Self-pitier, a Self-chastiser, an Ill-tempered man, a
      Superstitious, an Incredulous, etc., point to suggestive domestic themes.
    </p>
<p>
      Terence forwarded manuscript translations from Greece, that suffered
      shipwreck; he, who could have restored the treasure, died on the way home.
      The zealots of Byzantium completed the work of destruction. So we have the
      four comedies of Terence, numbering six of Menander, with a few sketches
      of plots—one of them, the Thesaurus, introduces a miser, whom we
      should have liked to contrast with Harpagon—and a multitude of small
      fragments of a sententious cast, fitted for quotation. Enough remains to
      make his greatness felt.
    </p>
<p>
      Without undervaluing other writers of Comedy, I think it may be said that
      Menander and Moliere stand alone specially as comic poets of the feelings
      and the idea. In each of them there is a conception of the Comic that
      refines even to pain, as in the Menedemus of the Heautontimorumenus, and
      in the Misanthrope. Menander and Moliere have given the principal types to
      Comedy hitherto. The Micio and Demea of the Adelphi, with their opposing
      views of the proper management of youth, are still alive; the Sganarelles
      and Arnolphes of the Ecole des Maris and the Ecole des Femmes, are not all
      buried. Tartuffe is the father of the hypocrites; Orgon of the dupes;
      Thraso, of the braggadocios; Alceste of the ‘Manlys’; Davus and Syrus of
      the intriguing valets, the Scapins and Figaros. Ladies that soar in the
      realms of Rose-Pink, whose language wears the nodding plumes of
      intellectual conceit, are traceable to Philaminte and Belise of the Femmes
      Savantes: and the mordant witty women have the tongue of Celimene. The
      reason is, that these two poets idealized upon life: the foundation of
      their types is real and in the quick, but they painted with spiritual
      strength, which is the solid in Art.
    </p>
<p>
      The idealistic conceptions of Comedy gives breadth and opportunities of
      daring to Comic genius, and helps to solve the difficulties it creates.
      How, for example, shall an audience be assured that an evident and
      monstrous dupe is actually deceived without being an absolute fool? In Le
      Tartuffe the note of high Comedy strikes when Orgon on his return home
      hears of his idol’s excellent appetite. ‘Le pauvre homme!’ he exclaims. He
      is told that the wife of his bosom has been unwell. ‘Et Tartuffe?’ he
      asks, impatient to hear him spoken of, his mind suffused with the thought
      of Tartuffe, crazy with tenderness, and again he croons, ‘Le pauvre
      homme!’ It is the mother’s cry of pitying delight at a nurse’s recital of
      the feats in young animal gluttony of her cherished infant. After this
      masterstroke of the Comic, you not only put faith in Orgon’s roseate
      prepossession, you share it with him by comic sympathy, and can listen
      with no more than a tremble of the laughing muscles to the instance he
      gives of the sublime humanity of Tartuffe:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Un rien presque suffit pour le scandaliser, Jusque-le, qu’il se vint
      l’autre jour accuser D’avoir pris une puce en faisant sa priere, Et de
      l’avoir tuee avec trop de colere.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      And to have killed it too wrathfully! Translating Moliere is like humming
      an air one has heard performed by an accomplished violinist of the pure
      tones without flourish.
    </p>
<p>
      Orgon, awakening to find another dupe in Madame Pernelle, incredulous of
      the revelations which have at last opened his own besotted eyes, is a
      scene of the double Comic, vivified by the spell previously cast on the
      mind. There we feel the power of the poet’s creation; and in the sharp
      light of that sudden turn the humanity is livelier than any realistic work
      can make it.
    </p>
<p>
      Italian Comedy gives many hints for a Tartuffe; but they may be found in
      Boccaccio, as well as in Machiavelli’s Mandragola. The Frate Timoteo of
      this piece is only a very oily friar, compliantly assisting an intrigue
      with ecclesiastical sophisms (to use the mildest word) for payment. Frate
      Timoteo has a fine Italian priestly pose.
    </p>
<p>
      DONNA: Credete voi, che’l Turco passi questo anno in Italia?
    </p>
<p>
      F. TIM.: Se voi non fate orazione, si.
    </p>
<p>
      Priestly arrogance and unctuousness, and trickeries and casuistries,
      cannot be painted without our discovering a likeness in the long Italian
      gallery. Goldoni sketched the Venetian manners of the decadence of the
      Republic with a French pencil, and was an Italian Scribe in style.
    </p>
<p>
      The Spanish stage is richer in such Comedies as that which furnished the
      idea of the Menteur to Corneille. But you must force yourself to believe
      that this liar is not forcing his vein when he piles lie upon lie. There
      is no preceding touch to win the mind to credulity. Spanish Comedy is
      generally in sharp outline, as of skeletons; in quick movement, as of
      marionnettes. The Comedy might be performed by a troop of the corps de
      ballet; and in the recollection of the reading it resolves to an animated
      shuffle of feet. It is, in fact, something other than the true idea of
      Comedy. Where the sexes are separated, men and women grow, as the
      Portuguese call it, affaimados of one another, famine-stricken; and all
      the tragic elements are on the stage. Don Juan is a comic character that
      sends souls flying: nor does the humour of the breaking of a dozen women’s
      hearts conciliate the Comic Muse with the drawing of blood.
    </p>
<p>
      German attempts at Comedy remind one vividly of Heine’s image of his
      country in the dancing of Atta Troll. Lessing tried his hand at it, with a
      sobering effect upon readers. The intention to produce the reverse effect
      is just visible, and therein, like the portly graces of the poor old
      Pyrenean Bear poising and twirling on his right hind-leg and his left,
      consists the fun. Jean Paul Richter gives the best edition of the German
      Comic in the contrast of Siebenkas with his Lenette. A light of the Comic
      is in Goethe; enough to complete the splendid figure of the man, but no
      more.
    </p>
<p>
      The German literary laugh, like the timed awakenings of their Barbarossa
      in the hollows of the Untersberg, is infrequent, and rather monstrous—never
      a laugh of men and women in concert. It comes of unrefined abstract fancy,
      grotesque or grim, or gross, like the peculiar humours of their little
      earthmen. Spiritual laughter they have not yet attained to: sentimentalism
      waylays them in the flight. Here and there a Volkslied or Marchen shows a
      national aptitude for stout animal laughter; and we see that the
      literature is built on it, which is hopeful so far; but to enjoy it, to
      enter into the philosophy of the Broad Grin, that seems to hesitate
      between the skull and the embryo, and reaches its perfection in breadth
      from the pulling of two square fingers at the corners of the mouth, one
      must have aid of ‘the good Rhine wine,’ and be of German blood unmixed
      besides. This treble-Dutch lumbersomeness of the Comic spirit is of itself
      exclusive of the idea of Comedy, and the poor voice allowed to women in
      German domestic life will account for the absence of comic dialogues
      reflecting upon life in that land. I shall speak of it again in the second
      section of this lecture.
    </p>
<p>
      Eastward you have total silence of Comedy among a people intensely
      susceptible to laughter, as the Arabian Nights will testify. Where the
      veil is over women’s-faces, you cannot have society, without which the
      senses are barbarous and the Comic spirit is driven to the gutters of
      grossness to slake its thirst. Arabs in this respect are worse than
      Italians—much worse than Germans; just in the degree that their
      system of treating women is worse.
    </p>
<p>
      M. Saint-Marc Girardin, the excellent French essayist and master of
      critical style, tells of a conversation he had once with an Arab gentleman
      on the topic of the different management of these difficult creatures in
      Orient and in Occident: and the Arab spoke in praise of many good results
      of the greater freedom enjoyed by Western ladies, and the charm of
      conversing with them. He was questioned why his countrymen took no
      measures to grant them something of that kind of liberty. He jumped out of
      his individuality in a twinkling, and entered into the sentiments of his
      race, replying, from the pinnacle of a splendid conceit, with affected
      humility of manner: ‘YOU can look on them without perturbation—but
      WE!’... And after this profoundly comic interjection, he added, in deep
      tones, ‘The very face of a woman!’ Our representative of temperate notions
      demurely consented that the Arab’s pride of inflammability should insist
      on the prudery of the veil as the civilizing medium of his race.
    </p>
<p>
      There has been fun in Bagdad. But there never will be civilization where
      Comedy is not possible; and that comes of some degree of social equality
      of the sexes. I am not quoting the Arab to exhort and disturb the
      somnolent East; rather for cultivated women to recognize that the Comic
      Muse is one of their best friends. They are blind to their interests in
      swelling the ranks of the sentimentalists. Let them look with their
      clearest vision abroad and at home. They will see that where they have no
      social freedom, Comedy is absent: where they are household drudges, the
      form of Comedy is primitive: where they are tolerably independent, but
      uncultivated, exciting melodrama takes its place and a sentimental version
      of them. Yet the Comic will out, as they would know if they listened to
      some of the private conversations of men whose minds are undirected by the
      Comic Muse: as the sentimental man, to his astonishment, would know
      likewise, if he in similar fashion could receive a lesson. But where women
      are on the road to an equal footing with men, in attainments and in
      liberty—in what they have won for themselves, and what has been
      granted them by a fair civilization—there, and only waiting to be
      transplanted from life to the stage, or the novel, or the poem, pure
      Comedy flourishes, and is, as it would help them to be, the sweetest of
      diversions, the wisest of delightful companions.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, to look about us in the present time, I think it will be acknowledged
      that in neglecting the cultivation of the Comic idea, we are losing the
      aid of a powerful auxiliar. You see Folly perpetually sliding into new
      shapes in a society possessed of wealth and leisure, with many whims, many
      strange ailments and strange doctors. Plenty of common-sense is in the
      world to thrust her back when she pretends to empire. But the first-born
      of common-sense, the vigilant Comic, which is the genius of thoughtful
      laughter, which would readily extinguish her at the outset, is not serving
      as a public advocate.
    </p>
<p>
      You will have noticed the disposition of common-sense, under pressure of
      some pertinacious piece of light-headedness, to grow impatient and angry.
      That is a sign of the absence, or at least of the dormancy, of the Comic
      idea. For Folly is the natural prey of the Comic, known to it in all her
      transformations, in every disguise; and it is with the springing delight
      of hawk over heron, hound after fox, that it gives her chase, never
      fretting, never tiring, sure of having her, allowing her no rest.
    </p>
<p>
      Contempt is a sentiment that cannot be entertained by comic intelligence.
      What is it but an excuse to be idly minded, or personally lofty, or
      comfortably narrow, not perfectly humane? If we do not feign when we say
      that we despise Folly, we shut the brain. There is a disdainful attitude
      in the presence of Folly, partaking of the foolishness to Comic
      perception: and anger is not much less foolish than disdain. The struggle
      we have to conduct is essence against essence. Let no one doubt of the
      sequel when this emanation of what is firmest in us is launched to strike
      down the daughter of Unreason and Sentimentalism: such being Folly’s
      parentage, when it is respectable.
    </p>
<p>
      Our modern system of combating her is too long defensive, and carried on
      too ploddingly with concrete engines of war in the attack. She has time to
      get behind entrenchments. She is ready to stand a siege, before the
      heavily armed man of science and the writer of the leading article or
      elaborate essay have primed their big guns. It should be remembered that
      she has charms for the multitude; and an English multitude seeing her make
      a gallant fight of it will be half in love with her, certainly willing to
      lend her a cheer. Benevolent subscriptions assist her to hire her own man
      of science, her own organ in the Press. If ultimately she is cast out and
      overthrown, she can stretch a finger at gaps in our ranks. She can say
      that she commanded an army and seduced men, whom we thought sober men and
      safe, to act as her lieutenants. We learn rather gloomily, after she has
      flashed her lantern, that we have in our midst able men and men with minds
      for whom there is no pole-star in intellectual navigation. Comedy, or the
      Comic element, is the specific for the poison of delusion while Folly is
      passing from the state of vapour to substantial form.
    </p>
<p>
      O for a breath of Aristophanes, Rabelais, Voltaire, Cervantes, Fielding,
      Moliere! These are spirits that, if you know them well, will come when you
      do call. You will find the very invocation of them act on you like a
      renovating air—the South-west coming off the sea, or a cry in the
      Alps.
    </p>
<p>
      No one would presume to say that we are deficient in jokers. They abound,
      and the organisation directing their machinery to shoot them in the wake
      of the leading article and the popular sentiment is good.
    </p>
<p>
      But the Comic differs from them in addressing the wits for laughter; and
      the sluggish wits want some training to respond to it, whether in public
      life or private, and particularly when the feelings are excited.
    </p>
<p>
      The sense of the Comic is much blunted by habits of punning and of using
      humouristic phrase: the trick of employing Johnsonian polysyllables to
      treat of the infinitely little. And it really may be humorous, of a kind,
      yet it will miss the point by going too much round about it.
    </p>
<p>
      A certain French Duke Pasquier died, some years back, at a very advanced
      age. He had been the venerable Duke Pasquier in his later years up to the
      period of his death. There was a report of Duke Pasquier that he was a man
      of profound egoism. Hence an argument arose, and was warmly sustained,
      upon the excessive selfishness of those who, in a world of troubles, and
      calls to action, and innumerable duties, husband their strength for the
      sake of living on. Can it be possible, the argument ran, for a truly
      generous heart to continue beating up to the age of a hundred? Duke
      Pasquier was not without his defenders, who likened him to the oak of the
      forest—a venerable comparison.
    </p>
<p>
      The argument was conducted on both sides with spirit and earnestness,
      lightened here and there by frisky touches of the polysyllabic playful,
      reminding one of the serious pursuit of their fun by truant boys, that are
      assured they are out of the eye of their master, and now and then indulge
      in an imitation of him. And well might it be supposed that the Comic idea
      was asleep, not overlooking them! It resolved at last to this, that either
      Duke Pasquier was a scandal on our humanity in clinging to life so long,
      or that he honoured it by so sturdy a resistance to the enemy. As one who
      has entangled himself in a labyrinth is glad to get out again at the
      entrance, the argument ran about to conclude with its commencement.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, imagine a master of the Comic treating this theme, and particularly
      the argument on it. Imagine an Aristophanic comedy of THE CENTENARIAN,
      with choric praises of heroical early death, and the same of a stubborn
      vitality, and the poet laughing at the chorus; and the grand question for
      contention in dialogue, as to the exact age when a man should die, to the
      identical minute, that he may preserve the respect of his fellows,
      followed by a systematic attempt to make an accurate measurement in
      parallel lines, with a tough rope-yarn by one party, and a string of yawns
      by the other, of the veteran’s power of enduring life, and our capacity
      for enduring HIM, with tremendous pulling on both sides.
    </p>
<p>
      Would not the Comic view of the discussion illumine it and the disputants
      like very lightning? There are questions, as well as persons, that only
      the Comic can fitly touch.
    </p>
<p>
      Aristophanes would probably have crowned the ancient tree, with the
      consolatory observation to the haggard line of long-expectant heirs of the
      Centenarian, that they live to see the blessedness of coming of a strong
      stock. The shafts of his ridicule would mainly have been aimed at the
      disputants. For the sole ground of the argument was the old man’s
      character, and sophists are not needed to demonstrate that we can very
      soon have too much of a bad thing. A Centenarian does not necessarily
      provoke the Comic idea, nor does the corpse of a duke. It is not provoked
      in the order of nature, until we draw its penetrating attentiveness to
      some circumstance with which we have been mixing our private interests, or
      our speculative obfuscation. Dulness, insensible to the Comic, has the
      privilege of arousing it; and the laying of a dull finger on matters of
      human life is the surest method of establishing electrical communications
      with a battery of laughter—where the Comic idea is prevalent.
    </p>
<p>
      But if the Comic idea prevailed with us, and we had an Aristophanes to
      barb and wing it, we should be breathing air of Athens. Prosers now
      pouring forth on us like public fountains would be cut short in the street
      and left blinking, dumb as pillar-posts, with letters thrust into their
      mouths. We should throw off incubus, our dreadful familiar—by some
      called boredom—whom it is our present humiliation to be just alive
      enough to loathe, never quick enough to foil. There would be a bright and
      positive, clear Hellenic perception of facts. The vapours of Unreason and
      Sentimentalism would be blown away before they were productive. Where
      would Pessimist and Optimist be? They would in any case have a diminished
      audience. Yet possibly the change of despots, from good-natured old
      obtuseness to keen-edged intelligence, which is by nature merciless, would
      be more than we could bear. The rupture of the link between dull people,
      consisting in the fraternal agreement that something is too clever for
      them, and a shot beyond them, is not to be thought of lightly; for,
      slender though the link may seem, it is equivalent to a cement forming a
      concrete of dense cohesion, very desirable in the estimation of the
      statesman.
    </p>
<p>
      A political Aristophanes, taking advantage of his lyrical Bacchic licence,
      was found too much for political Athens. I would not ask to have him
      revived, but that the sharp light of such a spirit as his might be with us
      to strike now and then on public affairs, public themes, to make them spin
      along more briskly.
    </p>
<p>
      He hated with the politician’s fervour the sophist who corrupted
      simplicity of thought, the poet who destroyed purity of style, the
      demagogue, ‘the saw-toothed monster,’ who, as he conceived, chicaned the
      mob, and he held his own against them by strength of laughter, until
      fines, the curtailing of his Comic licence in the chorus, and ultimately
      the ruin of Athens, which could no longer support the expense of the
      chorus, threw him altogether on dialogue, and brought him under the law.
      After the catastrophe, the poet, who had ever been gazing back at the men
      of Marathon and Salamis, must have felt that he had foreseen it; and that
      he was wise when he pleaded for peace, and derided military coxcombry, and
      the captious old creature Demus, we can admit. He had the Comic poet’s
      gift of common-sense—which does not always include political
      intelligence; yet his political tendency raised him above the Old Comedy
      turn for uproarious farce. He abused Socrates, but Xenophon, the disciple
      of Socrates, by his trained rhetoric saved the Ten Thousand. Aristophanes
      might say that if his warnings had been followed there would have been no
      such thing as a mercenary Greek expedition under Cyrus. Athens, however,
      was on a landslip, falling; none could arrest it. To gaze back, to uphold
      the old times, was a most natural conservatism, and fruitless. The aloe
      had bloomed. Whether right or wrong in his politics and his criticisms,
      and bearing in mind the instruments he played on and the audience he had
      to win, there is an idea in his comedies: it is the Idea of Good
      Citizenship.
    </p>
<p>
      He is not likely to be revived. He stands, like Shakespeare, an
      unapproachable. Swift says of him, with a loving chuckle:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But as for Comic Aristophanes, The dog too witty and too profane is.’ 
    </p>
<p>
      Aristophanes was ‘profane,’ under satiric direction, unlike his rivals
      Cratinus, Phrynichus, Ameipsias, Eupolis, and others, if we are to believe
      him, who in their extraordinary Donnybrook Fair of the day of Comedy,
      thumped one another and everybody else with absolute heartiness, as he
      did, but aimed at small game, and dragged forth particular women, which he
      did not. He is an aggregate of many men, all of a certain greatness. We
      may build up a conception of his powers if we mount Rabelais upon
      Hudibras, lift him with the songfulness of Shelley, give him a vein of
      Heinrich Heine, and cover him with the mantle of the Anti-Jacobin, adding
      (that there may be some Irish in him) a dash of Grattan, before he is in
      motion.
    </p>
<p>
      But such efforts at conceiving one great one by incorporation of minors
      are vain, and cry for excuse. Supposing Wilkes for leading man in a
      country constantly plunging into war under some plumed Lamachus, with
      enemies periodically firing the land up to the gates of London, and a
      Samuel Foote, of prodigious genius, attacking him with ridicule, I think
      it gives a notion of the conflict engaged in by Aristophanes. This
      laughing bald-pate, as he calls himself, was a Titanic pamphleteer, using
      laughter for his political weapon; a laughter without scruple, the
      laughter of Hercules. He was primed with wit, as with the garlic he speaks
      of giving to the game-cocks, to make them fight the better. And he was a
      lyric poet of aerial delicacy, with the homely song of a jolly national
      poet, and a poet of such feeling that the comic mask is at times no
      broader than a cloth on a face to show the serious features of our common
      likeness. He is not to be revived; but if his method were studied, some of
      the fire in him would come to us, and we might be revived.
    </p>
<p>
      Taking them generally, the English public are most in sympathy with this
      primitive Aristophanic comedy, wherein the comic is capped by the
      grotesque, irony tips the wit, and satire is a naked sword. They have the
      basis of the Comic in them: an esteem for common-sense. They cordially
      dislike the reverse of it. They have a rich laugh, though it is not the
      gros rire of the Gaul tossing gros sel, nor the polished Frenchman’s
      mentally digestive laugh. And if they have now, like a monarch with a
      troop of dwarfs, too many jesters kicking the dictionary about, to let
      them reflect that they are dull, occasionally, like the pensive monarch
      surprising himself with an idea of an idea of his own, they look so. And
      they are given to looking in the glass. They must see that something ails
      them. How much even the better order of them will endure, without a
      thought of the defensive, when the person afflicting them is protected
      from satire, we read in Memoirs of a Preceding Age, where the vulgarly
      tyrannous hostess of a great house of reception shuffled the guests and
      played them like a pack of cards, with her exact estimate of the strength
      of each one printed on them: and still this house continued to be the most
      popular in England; nor did the lady ever appear in print or on the boards
      as the comic type that she was.
    </p>
<p>
      It has been suggested that they have not yet spiritually comprehended the
      signification of living in society; for who are cheerfuller, brisker of
      wit, in the fields, and as explorers, colonisers, backwoodsmen? They are
      happy in rough exercise, and also in complete repose. The intermediate
      condition, when they are called upon to talk to one another, upon other
      than affairs of business or their hobbies, reveals them wearing a curious
      look of vacancy, as it were the socket of an eye wanting. The Comic is
      perpetually springing up in social life, and, it oppresses them from not
      being perceived.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, at a dinner-party, one of the guests, who happens to have enrolled
      himself in a Burial Company, politely entreats the others to inscribe
      their names as shareholders, expatiating on the advantages accruing to
      them in the event of their very possible speedy death, the salubrity of
      the site, the aptitude of the soil for a quick consumption of their
      remains, etc.; and they drink sadness from the incongruous man, and
      conceive indigestion, not seeing him in a sharply defined light, that
      would bid them taste the comic of him. Or it is mentioned that a newly
      elected member of our Parliament celebrates his arrival at eminence by the
      publication of a book on cab-fares, dedicated to a beloved female relative
      deceased, and the comment on it is the word ‘Indeed.’ But, merely for a
      contrast, turn to a not uncommon scene of yesterday in the hunting-field,
      where a brilliant young rider, having broken his collar-bone, trots away
      very soon after, against medical interdict, half put together in
      splinters, to the most distant meet of his neighbourhood, sure of escaping
      his doctor, who is the first person he encounters. ‘I came here purposely
      to avoid you,’ says the patient. ‘I came here purposely to take care of
      you,’ says the doctor. Off they go, and come to a swollen brook. The
      patient clears it handsomely: the doctor tumbles in. All the field are
      alive with the heartiest relish of every incident and every cross-light on
      it; and dull would the man have been thought who had not his word to say
      about it when riding home.
    </p>
<p>
      In our prose literature we have had delightful Comic writers. Besides
      Fielding and Goldsmith, there is Miss Austen, whose Emma and Mr. Elton
      might walk straight into a comedy, were the plot arranged for them. Galt’s
      neglected novels have some characters and strokes of shrewd comedy. In our
      poetic literature the comic is delicate and graceful above the touch of
      Italian and French. Generally, however, the English elect excel in satire,
      and they are noble humourists. The national disposition is for
      hard-hitting, with a moral purpose to sanction it; or for a rosy,
      sometimes a larmoyant, geniality, not unmanly in its verging upon
      tenderness, and with a singular attraction for thick-headedness, to
      decorate it with asses’ ears and the most beautiful sylvan haloes. But the
      Comic is a different spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      You may estimate your capacity for Comic perception by being able to
      detect the ridicule of them you love, without loving them less: and more
      by being able to see yourself somewhat ridiculous in dear eyes, and
      accepting the correction their image of you proposes.
    </p>
<p>
      Each one of an affectionate couple may be willing, as we say, to die for
      the other, yet unwilling to utter the agreeable word at the right moment;
      but if the wits were sufficiently quick for them to perceive that they are
      in a comic situation, as affectionate couples must be when they quarrel,
      they would not wait for the moon or the almanac, or a Dorine, to bring
      back the flood-tide of tender feelings, that they should join hands and
      lips.
    </p>
<p>
      If you detect the ridicule, and your kindliness is chilled by it, you are
      slipping into the grasp of Satire.
    </p>
<p>
      If instead of falling foul of the ridiculous person with a satiric rod, to
      make him writhe and shriek aloud, you prefer to sting him under a
      semi-caress, by which he shall in his anguish be rendered dubious whether
      indeed anything has hurt him, you are an engine of Irony.
    </p>
<p>
      If you laugh all round him, tumble him, roll him about, deal him a smack,
      and drop a tear on him, own his likeness to you and yours to your
      neighbour, spare him as little as you shun, pity him as much as you
      expose, it is a spirit of Humour that is moving you.
    </p>
<p>
      The Comic, which is the perceptive, is the governing spirit, awakening and
      giving aim to these powers of laughter, but it is not to be confounded
      with them: it enfolds a thinner form of them, differing from satire, in
      not sharply driving into the quivering sensibilities, and from humour, in
      not comforting them and tucking them up, or indicating a broader than the
      range of this bustling world to them.
    </p>
<p>
      Fielding’s Jonathan Wild presents a case of this peculiar distinction,
      when that man of eminent greatness remarks upon the unfairness of a trial
      in which the condemnation has been brought about by twelve men of the
      opposite party; for it is not satiric, it is not humorous; yet it is
      immensely comic to hear a guilty villain protesting that his own ‘party’ 
      should have a voice in the Law. It opens an avenue into villains’ 
      ratiocination. {9} And the Comic is not cancelled though we should suppose
      Jonathan to be giving play to his humour. I may have dreamed this or had
      it suggested to me, for on referring to Jonathan Wild, I do not find it.
    </p>
<p>
      Apply the case to the man of deep wit, who is ever certain of his
      condemnation by the opposite party, and then it ceases to be comic, and
      will be satiric.
    </p>
<p>
      The look of Fielding upon Richardson is essentially comic. His method of
      correcting the sentimental writer is a mixture of the comic and the
      humorous. Parson Adams is a creation of humour. But both the conception
      and the presentation of Alceste and of Tartuffe, of Celimene and
      Philaminte, are purely comic, addressed to the intellect: there is no
      humour in them, and they refresh the intellect they quicken to detect
      their comedy, by force of the contrast they offer between themselves and
      the wiser world about them; that is to say, society, or that assemblage of
      minds whereof the Comic spirit has its origin.
    </p>
<p>
      Byron had splendid powers of humour, and the most poetic satire that we
      have example of, fusing at times to hard irony. He had no strong comic
      sense, or he would not have taken an anti-social position, which is
      directly opposed to the Comic; and in his philosophy, judged by
      philosophers, he is a comic figure, by reason of this deficiency. ‘So bald
      er philosophirt ist er ein Kind,’ Goethe says of him. Carlyle sees him in
      this comic light, treats him in the humorous manner.
    </p>
<p>
      The Satirist is a moral agent, often a social scavenger, working on a
      storage of bile.
    </p>
<p>
      The Ironeist is one thing or another, according to his caprice. Irony is
      the humour of satire; it may be savage as in Swift, with a moral object,
      or sedate, as in Gibbon, with a malicious. The foppish irony fretting to
      be seen, and the irony which leers, that you shall not mistake its
      intention, are failures in satiric effort pretending to the treasures of
      ambiguity.
    </p>
<p>
      The Humourist of mean order is a refreshing laugher, giving tone to the
      feelings and sometimes allowing the feelings to be too much for him. But
      the humourist of high has an embrace of contrasts beyond the scope of the
      Comic poet.
    </p>
<p>
      Heart and mind laugh out at Don Quixote, and still you brood on him. The
      juxtaposition of the knight and squire is a Comic conception, the
      opposition of their natures most humorous. They are as different as the
      two hemispheres in the time of Columbus, yet they touch and are bound in
      one by laughter. The knight’s great aims and constant mishaps, his
      chivalrous valiancy exercised on absurd objects, his good sense along the
      highroad of the craziest of expeditions; the compassion he plucks out of
      derision, and the admirable figure he preserves while stalking through the
      frantically grotesque and burlesque assailing him, are in the loftiest
      moods of humour, fusing the Tragic sentiment with the Comic narrative.
    </p>
<p>
      The stroke of the great humourist is world-wide, with lights of Tragedy in
      his laughter.
    </p>
<p>
      Taking a living great, though not creative, humourist to guide our
      description: the skull of Yorick is in his hands in our seasons of
      festival; he sees visions of primitive man capering preposterously under
      the gorgeous robes of ceremonial. Our souls must be on fire when we wear
      solemnity, if we would not press upon his shrewdest nerve. Finite and
      infinite flash from one to the other with him, lending him a two-edged
      thought that peeps out of his peacefullest lines by fits, like the lantern
      of the fire-watcher at windows, going the rounds at night. The comportment
      and performances of men in society are to him, by the vivid comparison
      with their mortality, more grotesque than respectable. But ask yourself,
      Is he always to be relied on for justness? He will fly straight as the
      emissary eagle back to Jove at the true Hero. He will also make as
      determined a swift descent upon the man of his wilful choice, whom we
      cannot distinguish as a true one. This vast power of his, built up of the
      feelings and the intellect in union, is often wanting in proportion and in
      discretion. Humourists touching upon History or Society are given to be
      capricious. They are, as in the case of Sterne, given to be sentimental;
      for with them the feelings are primary, as with singers. Comedy, on the
      other hand, is an interpretation of the general mind, and is for that
      reason of necessity kept in restraint. The French lay marked stress on
      mesure et gout, and they own how much they owe to Moliere for leading them
      in simple justness and taste. We can teach them many things; they can
      teach us in this.
    </p>
<p>
      The Comic poet is in the narrow field, or enclosed square, of the society
      he depicts; and he addresses the still narrower enclosure of men’s
      intellects, with reference to the operation of the social world upon their
      characters. He is not concerned with beginnings or endings or
      surroundings, but with what you are now weaving. To understand his work
      and value it, you must have a sober liking of your kind and a sober
      estimate of our civilized qualities. The aim and business of the Comic
      poet are misunderstood, his meaning is not seized nor his point of view
      taken, when he is accused of dishonouring our nature and being hostile to
      sentiment, tending to spitefulness and making an unfair use of laughter.
      Those who detect irony in Comedy do so because they choose to see it in
      life. Poverty, says the satirist, has nothing harder in itself than that
      it makes men ridiculous. But poverty is never ridiculous to Comic
      perception until it attempts to make its rags conceal its bareness in a
      forlorn attempt at decency, or foolishly to rival ostentation. Caleb
      Balderstone, in his endeavour to keep up the honour of a noble household
      in a state of beggary, is an exquisitely comic character. In the case of
      ‘poor relatives,’ on the other hand, it is the rich, whom they perplex,
      that are really comic; and to laugh at the former, not seeing the comedy
      of the latter, is to betray dulness of vision. Humourist and Satirist
      frequently hunt together as Ironeists in pursuit of the grotesque, to the
      exclusion of the Comic. That was an affecting moment in the history of the
      Prince Regent, when the First Gentleman of Europe burst into tears at a
      sarcastic remark of Beau Brummell’s on the cut of his coat. Humour,
      Satire, Irony, pounce on it altogether as their common prey. The Comic
      spirit eyes but does not touch it. Put into action, it would be farcical.
      It is too gross for Comedy.
    </p>
<p>
      Incidents of a kind casting ridicule on our unfortunate nature instead of
      our conventional life, provoke derisive laughter, which thwarts the Comic
      idea. But derision is foiled by the play of the intellect. Most of
      doubtful causes in contest are open to Comic interpretation, and any
      intellectual pleading of a doubtful cause contains germs of an Idea of
      Comedy.
    </p>
<p>
      The laughter of satire is a blow in the back or the face. The laughter of
      Comedy is impersonal and of unrivalled politeness, nearer a smile; often
      no more than a smile. It laughs through the mind, for the mind directs it;
      and it might be called the humour of the mind.
    </p>
<p>
      One excellent test of the civilization of a country, as I have said, I
      take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy; and the test of
      true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter.
    </p>
<p>
      If you believe that our civilization is founded in common-sense (and it is
      the first condition of sanity to believe it), you will, when contemplating
      men, discern a Spirit overhead; not more heavenly than the light flashed
      upward from glassy surfaces, but luminous and watchful; never shooting
      beyond them, nor lagging in the rear; so closely attached to them that it
      may be taken for a slavish reflex, until its features are studied. It has
      the sage’s brows, and the sunny malice of a faun lurks at the corners of
      the half-closed lips drawn in an idle wariness of half tension. That slim
      feasting smile, shaped like the long-bow, was once a big round satyr’s
      laugh, that flung up the brows like a fortress lifted by gunpowder. The
      laugh will come again, but it will be of the order of the smile, finely
      tempered, showing sunlight of the mind, mental richness rather than noisy
      enormity. Its common aspect is one of unsolicitous observation, as if
      surveying a full field and having leisure to dart on its chosen morsels,
      without any fluttering eagerness. Men’s future upon earth does not attract
      it; their honesty and shapeliness in the present does; and whenever they
      wax out of proportion, overblown, affected, pretentious, bombastical,
      hypocritical, pedantic, fantastically delicate; whenever it sees them
      self-deceived or hoodwinked, given to run riot in idolatries, drifting
      into vanities, congregating in absurdities, planning short-sightedly,
      plotting dementedly; whenever they are at variance with their professions,
      and violate the unwritten but perceptible laws binding them in
      consideration one to another; whenever they offend sound reason, fair
      justice; are false in humility or mined with conceit, individually, or in
      the bulk—the Spirit overhead will look humanely malign and cast an
      oblique light on them, followed by volleys of silvery laughter. That is
      the Comic Spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      Not to distinguish it is to be bull-blind to the spiritual, and to deny
      the existence of a mind of man where minds of men are in working
      conjunction.
    </p>
<p>
      You must, as I have said, believe that our state of society is founded in
      common-sense, otherwise you will not be struck by the contrasts the Comic
      Spirit perceives, or have it to look to for your consolation. You will, in
      fact, be standing in that peculiar oblique beam of light, yourself
      illuminated to the general eye as the very object of chase and doomed
      quarry of the thing obscure to you. But to feel its presence and to see it
      is your assurance that many sane and solid minds are with you in what you
      are experiencing: and this of itself spares you the pain of satirical
      heat, and the bitter craving to strike heavy blows. You share the sublime
      of wrath, that would not have hurt the foolish, but merely demonstrate
      their foolishness. Moliere was contented to revenge himself on the critics
      of the Ecole des Femmes, by writing the Critique de l’Ecole des Femmes,
      one of the wisest as well as the playfullest of studies in criticism. A
      perception of the comic spirit gives high fellowship. You become a citizen
      of the selecter world, the highest we know of in connection with our old
      world, which is not supermundane. Look there for your unchallengeable
      upper class! You feel that you are one of this our civilized community,
      that you cannot escape from it, and would not if you could. Good hope
      sustains you; weariness does not overwhelm you; in isolation you see no
      charms for vanity; personal pride is greatly moderated. Nor shall your
      title of citizenship exclude you from worlds of imagination or of
      devotion. The Comic spirit is not hostile to the sweetest songfully
      poetic. Chaucer bubbles with it: Shakespeare overflows: there is a mild
      moon’s ray of it (pale with super-refinement through distance from our
      flesh and blood planet) in Comus. Pope has it, and it is the daylight side
      of the night half obscuring Cowper. It is only hostile to the priestly
      element, when that, by baleful swelling, transcends and overlaps the
      bounds of its office: and then, in extreme cases, it is too true to itself
      to speak, and veils the lamp: as, for example, the spectacle of Bossuet
      over the dead body of Moliere: at which the dark angels may, but men do
      not laugh.
    </p>
<p>
      We have had comic pulpits, for a sign that the laughter-moving and the
      worshipful may be in alliance: I know not how far comic, or how much
      assisted in seeming so by the unexpectedness and the relief of its
      appearance: at least they are popular, they are said to win the ear.
      Laughter is open to perversion, like other good things; the scornful and
      the brutal sorts are not unknown to us; but the laughter directed by the
      Comic spirit is a harmless wine, conducing to sobriety in the degree that
      it enlivens. It enters you like fresh air into a study; as when one of the
      sudden contrasts of the comic idea floods the brain like reassuring
      daylight. You are cognizant of the true kind by feeling that you take it
      in, savour it, and have what flowers live on, natural air for food. That
      which you give out—the joyful roar—is not the better part; let
      that go to good fellowship and the benefit of the lungs. Aristophanes
      promises his auditors that if they will retain the ideas of the comic poet
      carefully, as they keep dried fruits in boxes, their garments shall smell
      odoriferous of wisdom throughout the year. The boast will not be thought
      an empty one by those who have choice friends that have stocked themselves
      according to his directions. Such treasuries of sparkling laughter are
      wells in our desert. Sensitiveness to the comic laugh is a step in
      civilization. To shrink from being an object of it is a step in
      cultivation. We know the degree of refinement in men by the matter they
      will laugh at, and the ring of the laugh; but we know likewise that the
      larger natures are distinguished by the great breadth of their power of
      laughter, and no one really loving Moliere is refined by that love to
      despise or be dense to Aristophanes, though it may be that the lover of
      Aristophanes will not have risen to the height of Moliere. Embrace them
      both, and you have the whole scale of laughter in your breast. Nothing in
      the world surpasses in stormy fun the scene in The Frogs, when Bacchus and
      Xanthias receive their thrashings from the hands of businesslike OEacus,
      to discover which is the divinity of the two, by his imperviousness to the
      mortal condition of pain, and each, under the obligation of not crying
      out, makes believe that his horrible bellow—the god’s iou—iou
      being the lustier—means only the stopping of a sneeze, or horseman
      sighted, or the prelude to an invocation to some deity: and the slave
      contrives that the god shall get the bigger lot of blows. Passages of
      Rabelais, one or two in Don Quixote, and the Supper in the Manner of the
      Ancients, in Peregrine Pickle, are of a similar cataract of laughter. But
      it is not illuminating; it is not the laughter of the mind. Moliere’s
      laughter, in his purest comedies, is ethereal, as light to our nature, as
      colour to our thoughts. The Misanthrope and the Tartuffe have no audible
      laughter; but the characters are steeped in the comic spirit. They quicken
      the mind through laughter, from coming out of the mind; and the mind
      accepts them because they are clear interpretations of certain chapters of
      the Book lying open before us all. Between these two stand Shakespeare and
      Cervantes, with the richer laugh of heart and mind in one; with much of
      the Aristophanic robustness, something of Moliere’s delicacy.
    </p>
<p>
      The laughter heard in circles not pervaded by the Comic idea, will sound
      harsh and soulless, like versified prose, if you step into them with a
      sense of the distinction. You will fancy you have changed your habitation
      to a planet remoter from the sun. You may be among powerful brains too.
      You will not find poets—or but a stray one, over-worshipped. You
      will find learned men undoubtedly, professors, reputed philosophers, and
      illustrious dilettanti. They have in them, perhaps, every element
      composing light, except the Comic. They read verse, they discourse of art;
      but their eminent faculties are not under that vigilant sense of a
      collective supervision, spiritual and present, which we have taken note
      of. They build a temple of arrogance; they speak much in the voice of
      oracles; their hilarity, if it does not dip in grossness, is usually a
      form of pugnacity.
    </p>
<p>
      Insufficiency of sight in the eye looking outward has deprived them of the
      eye that should look inward. They have never weighed themselves in the
      delicate balance of the Comic idea so as to obtain a suspicion of the
      rights and dues of the world; and they have, in consequence, an irritable
      personality. A very learned English professor crushed an argument in a
      political discussion, by asking his adversary angrily: ‘Are you aware,
      sir, that I am a philologer?’ 
    </p>
<p>
      The practice of polite society will help in training them, and the
      professor on a sofa with beautiful ladies on each side of him, may become
      their pupil and a scholar in manners without knowing it: he is at least a
      fair and pleasing spectacle to the Comic Muse. But the society named
      polite is volatile in its adorations, and to-morrow will be petting a
      bronzed soldier, or a black African, or a prince, or a spiritualist: ideas
      cannot take root in its ever-shifting soil. It is besides addicted in
      self-defence to gabble exclusively of the affairs of its rapidly revolving
      world, as children on a whirligoround bestow their attention on the wooden
      horse or cradle ahead of them, to escape from giddiness and preserve a
      notion of identity. The professor is better out of a circle that often
      confounds by lionizing, sometimes annoys by abandoning, and always
      confuses. The school that teaches gently what peril there is lest a
      cultivated head should still be coxcomb’s, and the collisions which may
      befall high-soaring minds, empty or full, is more to be recommended than
      the sphere of incessant motion supplying it with material.
    </p>
<p>
      Lands where the Comic spirit is obscure overhead are rank with raw crops
      of matter. The traveller accustomed to smooth highways and people not
      covered with burrs and prickles is amazed, amid so much that is fair and
      cherishable, to come upon such curious barbarism. An Englishman paid a
      visit of admiration to a professor in the Land of Culture, and was
      introduced by him to another distinguished professor, to whom he took so
      cordially as to walk out with him alone one afternoon. The first
      professor, an erudite entirely worthy of the sentiment of scholarly esteem
      prompting the visit, behaved (if we exclude the dagger) with the
      vindictive jealousy of an injured Spanish beauty. After a short prelude of
      gloom and obscure explosions, he discharged upon his faithless admirer the
      bolts of passionate logic familiar to the ears of flighty caballeros:—‘Either
      I am a fit object of your admiration, or I am not. Of these things one—either
      you are competent to judge, in which case I stand condemned by you; or you
      are incompetent, and therefore impertinent, and you may betake yourself to
      your country again, hypocrite!’ The admirer was for persuading the wounded
      scholar that it is given to us to be able to admire two professors at a
      time. He was driven forth.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps this might have occurred in any country, and a comedy of The
      Pedant, discovering the greedy humanity within the dusty scholar, would
      not bring it home to one in particular. I am mindful that it was in
      Germany, when I observe that the Germans have gone through no comic
      training to warn them of the sly, wise emanation eyeing them from aloft,
      nor much of satirical. Heinrich Heine has not been enough to cause them to
      smart and meditate. Nationally, as well as individually, when they are
      excited they are in danger of the grotesque, as when, for instance, they
      decline to listen to evidence, and raise a national outcry because one of
      German blood has been convicted of crime in a foreign country. They are
      acute critics, yet they still wield clubs in controversy. Compare them in
      this respect with the people schooled in La Bruyere, La Fontaine, Moliere;
      with the people who have the figures of a Trissotin and a Vadius before
      them for a comic warning of the personal vanities of the caressed
      professor. It is more than difference of race. It is the difference of
      traditions, temper, and style, which comes of schooling.
    </p>
<p>
      The French controversialist is a polished swordsman, to be dreaded in his
      graces and courtesies. The German is Orson, or the mob, or a marching
      army, in defence of a good case or a bad—a big or a little. His
      irony is a missile of terrific tonnage: sarcasm he emits like a blast from
      a dragon’s mouth. He must and will be Titan. He stamps his foe underfoot,
      and is astonished that the creature is not dead, but stinging; for, in
      truth, the Titan is contending, by comparison, with a god.
    </p>
<p>
      When the Germans lie on their arms, looking across the Alsatian frontier
      at the crowds of Frenchmen rushing to applaud L’ami Fritz at the Theatre
      Francais, looking and considering the meaning of that applause, which is
      grimly comic in its political response to the domestic moral of the play—when
      the Germans watch and are silent, their force of character tells. They are
      kings in music, we may say princes in poetry, good speculators in
      philosophy, and our leaders in scholarship. That so gifted a race,
      possessed moreover of the stern good sense which collects the waters of
      laughter to make the wells, should show at a disadvantage, I hold for a
      proof, instructive to us, that the discipline of the comic spirit is
      needful to their growth. We see what they can reach to in that great
      figure of modern manhood, Goethe. They are a growing people; they are
      conversable as well; and when their men, as in France, and at intervals at
      Berlin tea-tables, consent to talk on equal terms with their women, and to
      listen to them, their growth will be accelerated and be shapelier. Comedy,
      or in any form the Comic spirit, will then come to them to cut some
      figures out of the block, show them the mirror, enliven and irradiate the
      social intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      Modern French comedy is commendable for the directness of the study of
      actual life, as far as that, which is but the early step in such a
      scholarship, can be of service in composing and colouring the picture. A
      consequence of this crude, though well-meant, realism is the collision of
      the writers in their scenes and incidents, and in their characters. The
      Muse of most of them is an Aventuriere. She is clever, and a certain
      diversion exists in the united scheme for confounding her. The object of
      this person is to reinstate herself in the decorous world; and either,
      having accomplished this purpose through deceit, she has a nostalgie de la
      boue, that eventually casts her back into it, or she is exposed in her
      course of deception when she is about to gain her end. A very good,
      innocent young man is her victim, or a very astute, goodish young man
      obstructs her path. This latter is enabled to be the champion of the
      decorous world by knowing the indecorous well. He has assisted in the
      progress of Aventurieres downward; he will not help them to ascend. The
      world is with him; and certainly it is not much of an ascension they
      aspire to; but what sort of a figure is he? The triumph of a candid
      realism is to show him no hero. You are to admire him (for it must be
      supposed that realism pretends to waken some admiration) as a credibly
      living young man; no better, only a little firmer and shrewder, than the
      rest. If, however, you think at all, after the curtain has fallen, you are
      likely to think that the Aventurieres have a case to plead against him.
      True, and the author has not said anything to the contrary; he has but
      painted from the life; he leaves his audience to the reflections of
      unphilosophic minds upon life, from the specimen he has presented in the
      bright and narrow circle of a spy-glass.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not know that the fly in amber is of any particular use, but the
      Comic idea enclosed in a comedy makes it more generally perceptible and
      portable, and that is an advantage. There is a benefit to men in taking
      the lessons of Comedy in congregations, for it enlivens the wits; and to
      writers it is beneficial, for they must have a clear scheme, and even if
      they have no idea to present, they must prove that they have made the
      public sit to them before the sitting to see the picture. And writing for
      the stage would be a corrective of a too-incrusted scholarly style, into
      which some great ones fall at times. It keeps minor writers to a definite
      plan, and to English. Many of them now swelling a plethoric market, in the
      composition of novels, in pun-manufactories and in journalism; attached to
      the machinery forcing perishable matter on a public that swallows
      voraciously and groans; might, with encouragement, be attending to the
      study of art in literature. Our critics appear to be fascinated by the
      quaintness of our public, as the world is when our beast-garden has a new
      importation of magnitude, and the creatures appetite is reverently
      consulted. They stipulate for a writer’s popularity before they will do
      much more than take the position of umpires to record his failure or
      success. Now the pig supplies the most popular of dishes, but it is not
      accounted the most honoured of animals, unless it be by the cottager. Our
      public might surely be led to try other, perhaps finer, meat. It has good
      taste in song. It might be taught as justly, on the whole, and the sooner
      when the cottager’s view of the feast shall cease to be the humble one of
      our literary critics, to extend this capacity for delicate choosing in the
      direction of the matter arousing laughter.

     The mildness of assured dictatorship
     Their idol pitched before them on the floor
     They miss their pleasure in pursuing it
     This mania of young people for pleasure, eternal pleasure
     Tossed him from repulsion to incredulity, and so back
     Two principal roads by which poor sinners come to a conscience
     Utterance of generous and patriotic cries is not sufficient
     We grew accustomed to periods of Irish fever
     We like well whatso we have done good work for
     We trust them or we crush them
     Weak reeds who are easily vanquished and never overcome
     Weak stomach is certainly more carnally virtuous than a full one
     Were I chained, For liberty I would sell liberty
     When we see our veterans tottering to their fall
     When you have done laughing with her, you can laugh at her
     Wins everywhere back a reflection of its own kindliness
     Wits, which are ordinarily less productive than land
     Woman descending from her ideal to the gross reality of man
     Your devotion craves an enormous exchange

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works

</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
