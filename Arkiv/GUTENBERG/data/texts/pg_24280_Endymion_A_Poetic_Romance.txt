PREFACE.
</h2>
<p>
Knowing within myself the manner in
which this Poem has been produced, it
is not without a feeling of regret that I
make it public.
</p>
<p>
What manner I mean, will be quite
clear to the reader, who must soon perceive
great inexperience, immaturity,
and every error denoting a feverish attempt,
rather than a deed accomplished.
The two first books, and indeed the two
last, I feel sensible are not of such completion
as to warrant their passing the
press; nor should they if I thought a
<!-- Page 6 -->
year's castigation would do them any
good;–it will not: the foundations are
too sandy. It is just that this youngster
should die away: a sad thought for me,
if I had not some hope that while it is
dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting
myself for verses fit to live.
</p>
<p>
This may be speaking too presumptuously,
and may deserve a punishment:
but no feeling man will be forward to
inflict it: he will leave me alone, with
the conviction that there is not a fiercer
hell than the failure in a great object.
This is not written with the least atom of
purpose to forestall criticisms of course,
but from the desire I have to conciliate
men who are competent to look, and who
do look with a zealous eye, to the honour
of English literature.
<!-- Page 7 -->
</p>
<p>
The imagination of a boy is healthy,
and the mature imagination of a man is
healthy; but there is a space of life between,
in which the soul is in a ferment,
the character undecided, the way of life
uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted:
thence proceeds mawkishness, and all
the thousand bitters which those men
I speak of must necessarily taste in going
over the following pages.
</p>
<p>
I hope I have not in too late a
day touched the beautiful mythology of
Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I
wish to try once more, before I bid it
farewel.
</p>

April 10, 1818.</i><br>

ENDYMION.

<p class="h2a">
BOOK I.
</p>
<p>
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:<br>
Its loveliness increases; it will never<br>
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br>
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep<br>
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.<br>
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing<br>
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,<br>
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth<br>
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,<br>
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways<span class="rmn">10</span><br>
<!-- Page 12 -->
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,<br>
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall<br>
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,<br>
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon<br>
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils<br>
With the green world they live in; and clear rills<br>
That for themselves a cooling covert make<br>
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,<br>
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:<br>
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms<span class="rmn">20</span><br>
We have imagined for the mighty dead;<br>
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:<br>
An endless fountain of immortal drink,<br>
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Nor do we merely feel these essences</span><br>
For one short hour; no, even as the trees<br>
That whisper round a temple become soon<br>
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,<br>
The passion poesy, glories infinite,<br>
Haunt us till they become a cheering light<span class="rmn">30</span><br>
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,<br>
<!-- Page 13 -->
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,<br>
They alway must be with us, or we die.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I</span><br>
Will trace the story of Endymion.<br>
The very music of the name has gone<br>
Into my being, and each pleasant scene<br>
Is growing fresh before me as the green<br>
Of our own vallies: so I will begin<br>
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;<span class="rmn">40</span><br>
Now while the early budders are just new,<br>
And run in mazes of the youngest hue<br>
About old forests; while the willow trails<br>
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails<br>
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year<br>
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer<br>
My little boat, for many quiet hours,<br>
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.<br>
Many and many a verse I hope to write,<br>
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,<span class="rmn">50</span><br>
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees<br>
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,<br>
<!-- Page 14 -->
I must be near the middle of my story.<br>
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,<br>
See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,<br>
With universal tinge of sober gold,<br>
Be all about me when I make an end.<br>
And now at once, adventuresome, I send<br>
My herald thought into a wilderness:<br>
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress<span class="rmn">60</span><br>
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed<br>
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread</span><br>
A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed<br>
So plenteously all weed-hidden roots<br>
Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.<br>
And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,<br>
Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep<br>
A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,<br>
Never again saw he the happy pens<span class="rmn">70</span><br>
Whither his brethren, bleating with content,<br>
Over the hills at every nightfall went.<br>
Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,<br>
<!-- Page 15 -->
That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever<br>
From the white flock, but pass'd unworried<br>
By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,<br>
Until it came to some unfooted plains<br>
Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains<br>
Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,<br>
Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,<span class="rmn">80</span><br>
And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly<br>
To a wide lawn, whence one could only see<br>
Stems thronging all around between the swell<br>
Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell<br>
The freshness of the space of heaven above,<br>
Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove<br>
Would often beat its wings, and often too<br>
A little cloud would move across the blue.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Full in the middle of this pleasantness</span><br>
There stood a marble altar, with a tress<span class="rmn">90</span><br>
Of flowers budded newly; and the dew<br>
Had taken fairy phantasies to strew<br>
Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,<br>
And so the dawned light in pomp receive.<br>
<!-- Page 16 -->
For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire<br>
Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre<br>
Of brightness so unsullied, that therein<br>
A melancholy spirit well might win<br>
Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine<br>
Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine<span class="rmn">100</span><br>
Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;<br>
The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run<br>
To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;<br>
Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass<br>
Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,<br>
To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Now while the silent workings of the dawn</span><br>
Were busiest, into that self-same lawn<br>
All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped<br>
A troop of little children garlanded;<span class="rmn">110</span><br>
Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry<br>
Earnestly round as wishing to espy<br>
Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited<br>
For many moments, ere their ears were sated<br>
With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then<br>
<!-- Page 17 -->
Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.<br>
Within a little space again it gave<br>
Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,<br>
To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking<br>
Through copse-clad vallies,–ere their death, o'ertaking<br>
The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.<span class="rmn">121</span><br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">And now, as deep into the wood as we</span><br>
Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light<br>
Fair faces and a rush of garments white,<br>
Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last<br>
Into the widest alley they all past,<br>
Making directly for the woodland altar.<br>
O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter<br>
In telling of this goodly company,<br>
Of their old piety, and of their glee:<span class="rmn">130</span><br>
But let a portion of ethereal dew<br>
Fall on my head, and presently unmew<br>
My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,<br>
To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Leading the way, young damsels danced along,</span><br>
<!-- Page 18 -->
Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;<br>
Each having a white wicker over brimm'd<br>
With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,<br>
A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks<br>
As may be read of in Arcadian books;<span class="rmn">140</span><br>
Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,<br>
When the great deity, for earth too ripe,<br>
Let his divinity o'er-flowing die<br>
In music, through the vales of Thessaly:<br>
Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,<br>
And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound<br>
With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,<br>
Now coming from beneath the forest trees,<br>
A venerable priest full soberly,<br>
Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye<span class="rmn">150</span><br>
Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,<br>
And after him his sacred vestments swept.<br>
From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,<br>
Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;<br>
And in his left he held a basket full<br>
Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:<br>
Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still<br>
<!-- Page 19 -->
Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.<br>
His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,<br>
Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth<span class="rmn">160</span><br>
Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd<br>
Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud<br>
Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,<br>
Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd<br>
Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,<br>
Easily rolling so as scarce to mar<br>
The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:<br>
Who stood therein did seem of great renown<br>
Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,<br>
Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;<span class="rmn">170</span><br>
And, for those simple times, his garments were<br>
A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,<br>
Was hung a silver bugle, and between<br>
His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.<br>
A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,<br>
To common lookers on, like one who dream'd<br>
Of idleness in groves Elysian:<br>
But there were some who feelingly could scan<br>
A lurking trouble in his nether lip,<br>
<!-- Page 20 -->
And see that oftentimes the reins would slip<span class="rmn">180</span><br>
Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,<br>
And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,<br>
Of logs piled solemnly.–Ah, well-a-day,<br>
Why should our young Endymion pine away!<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,</span><br>
Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd<br>
To sudden veneration: women meek<br>
Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek<br>
Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.<br>
Endymion too, without a forest peer,<span class="rmn">190</span><br>
Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,<br>
Among his brothers of the mountain chase.<br>
In midst of all, the venerable priest<br>
Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,<br>
And, after lifting up his aged hands,<br>
Thus spake he: "Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!<br>
Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:<br>
Whether descended from beneath the rocks<br>
That overtop your mountains; whether come<br>
From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;<span class="rmn">200</span><br>
<!-- Page 21 -->
Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs<br>
Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze<br>
Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge<br>
Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,<br>
Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn<br>
By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:<br>
Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare<br>
The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;<br>
And all ye gentle girls who foster up<br>
Udderless lambs, and in a little cup<span class="rmn">210</span><br>
Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:<br>
Yea, every one attend! for in good truth<br>
Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.<br>
Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than<br>
Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains<br>
Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains<br>
Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad<br>
Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had<br>
Great bounty from Endymion our lord.<br>
The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd<span class="rmn">220</span><br>
His early song against yon breezy sky,<br>
That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."<br>
<!-- Page 22 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire</span><br>
Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;<br>
Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod<br>
With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.<br>
Now while the earth was drinking it, and while<br>
Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,<br>
And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright<br>
'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light<span class="rmn">230</span><br>
Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"<span class="smcap">O thou</span>, whose mighty palace roof doth hang</span><br>
From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth<br>
Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death<br>
Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;<br>
Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress<br>
Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;<br>
And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken<br>
The dreary melody of bedded reeds–<br>
In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds<span class="rmn">240</span><br>
The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;<br>
Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth<br>
<!-- Page 23 -->
Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx–do thou now,<br>
By thy love's milky brow!<br>
By all the trembling mazes that she ran,<br>
Hear us, great Pan!<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles</span><br>
Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,<br>
What time thou wanderest at eventide<br>
Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side<span class="rmn">250</span><br>
Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom<br>
Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom<br>
Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees<br>
Their golden honeycombs; our village leas<br>
Their fairest blossom'd beans and poppied corn;<br>
The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,<br>
To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries<br>
Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies<br>
Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year<br>
All its completions–be quickly near,<span class="rmn">260</span><br>
By every wind that nods the mountain pine,<br>
O forester divine!<br>
<!-- Page 24 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies</span><br>
For willing service; whether to surprise<br>
The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;<br>
Or upward ragged precipices flit<br>
To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;<br>
Or by mysterious enticement draw<br>
Bewildered shepherds to their path again;<br>
Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,<span class="rmn">270</span><br>
And gather up all fancifullest shells<br>
For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,<br>
And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;<br>
Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,<br>

To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:<br>
Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,<br>
That come a swooning over hollow grounds,<br>
And wither drearily on barren moors:<br>
Dread opener of the mysterious doors<br>

Conception to the very bourne of heaven,<br>

Gives it a touch ethereal–a new birth:<br>

An element filling the space between;<br>

Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.<br>
Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,<br>
Young companies nimbly began dancing<br>
To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.<br>
Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly<br>
To tunes forgotten–out of memory:<br>
Fair creatures! whose young childrens' children bred<br>
Thermopylæ its heroes–not yet dead,<br>
But in old marbles ever beautiful.<br>
High genitors, unconscious did they cull<span class="rmn">320</span><br>
Time's sweet first-fruits–they danc'd to weariness,<br>
And then in quiet circles did they press<br>
The hillock turf, and caught the latter end<br>
Of some strange history, potent to send<br>

A young mind from its bodily tenement.<br>
Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent<br>
On either side; pitying the sad death<br>
Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath<br>
Of Zephyr slew him,–Zephyr penitent,<br>
Who now, ere Phœbus mounts the firmament,<span class="rmn">330</span><br>
Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.<br>
The archers too, upon a wider plain,<br>
Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,<br>
And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft<br>
Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,<br>
Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope<br>
Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee<br>
And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,<br>
Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young<br>
Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue<span class="rmn">340</span><br>
Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,<br>
And very, very deadliness did nip<br>
Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood<br>
By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,<br>
Uplifting his strong bow into the air,<br>
Many might after brighter visions stare:<br>
<!-- Page 28 -->
After the Argonauts, in blind amaze<br>
Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,<br>
Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,<br>
There shot a golden splendour far and wide,<span class="rmn">350</span><br>
Spangling those million poutings of the brine<br>
With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine<br>
From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;<br>
A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.<br>
Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,<br>
Might turn their steps towards the sober ring<br>
Where sat Endymion and the aged priest<br>
'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd<br>
The silvery setting of their mortal star.<br>
There they discours'd upon the fragile bar<span class="rmn">360</span><br>
That keeps us from our homes ethereal;<br>
And what our duties there: to nightly call<br>
Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;<br>
To summon all the downiest clouds together<br>
For the sun's purple couch; to emulate<br>
In ministring the potent rule of fate<br>
With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;<br>
To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons<br>
<!-- Page 29 -->
Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,<br>
A world of other unguess'd offices.<span class="rmn">370</span><br>
Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,<br>
Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse<br>
Each one his own anticipated bliss.<br>
One felt heart-certain that he could not miss<br>
His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,<br>
Where every zephyr-sigh pouts, and endows<br>
Her lips with music for the welcoming.<br>
Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,<br>
To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,<br>
Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:<span class="rmn">380</span><br>
Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,<br>
And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;<br>
And, ever after, through those regions be<br>
His messenger, his little Mercury,<br>
Some were athirst in soul to see again<br>
Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign<br>
In times long past; to sit with them, and talk<br>
Of all the chances in their earthly walk;<br>
Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores<br>
Of happiness, to when upon the moors,<span class="rmn">390</span><br>
<!-- Page 30 -->
Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,<br>
And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told<br>
Their fond imaginations,–saving him<br>
Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,<br>
Endymion: yet hourly had he striven<br>
To hide the cankering venom, that had riven<br>
His fainting recollections. Now indeed<br>
His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed<br>
The sudden silence, or the whispers low,<br>
Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,<span class="rmn">400</span><br>
Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,<br>
Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:<br>
But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,<br>
Like one who on the earth had never slept.<br>
Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,<br>
Frozen in that old tale Arabian.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Who whispers him so pantingly and close?</span><br>
Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,<br>
His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,<br>
And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade<span class="rmn">410</span><br>
A yielding up, a cradling on her care.<br>
<!-- Page 31 -->
Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:<br>
She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse<br>
Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,<br>
Along a path between two little streams,–<br>
Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,<br>
From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow<br>
From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;<br>
Until they came to where these streamlets fall,<br>
With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,<span class="rmn">420</span><br>
Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush<br>
With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.<br>
A little shallop, floating there hard by,<br>
Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;<br>
And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,<br>
And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,–<br>
Peona guiding, through the water straight,<br>
Towards a bowery island opposite;<br>
Which gaining presently, she steered light<br>
Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,<span class="rmn">430</span><br>
Where nested was an arbour, overwove<br>
By many a summer's silent fingering;<br>
To whose cool bosom she was used to bring<br>
<!-- Page 32 -->
Her playmates, with their needle broidery,<br>
And minstrel memories of times gone by.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">So she was gently glad to see him laid</span><br>
Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,<br>
On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,<br>
Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves<br>
When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,<span class="rmn">440</span><br>
And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.<br>
Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:<br>
But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest<br>
Peona's busy hand against his lips,<br>
And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips<br>
In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps<br>
A patient watch over the stream that creeps<br>
Windingly by it, so the quiet maid<br>
Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade<br>
Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling<span class="rmn">450</span><br>
Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling<br>
Among sere leaves and twigs, might all be heard.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,</span><br>
<!-- Page 33 -->
That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind<br>
Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd<br>
Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key<br>
To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,<br>
Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,<br>
Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves<br>
And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world<span class="rmn">460</span><br>
Of silvery enchantment!–who, upfurl'd<br>
Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,<br>
But renovates and lives?–Thus, in the bower,<br>
Endymion was calm'd to life again.<br>
Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,<br>
He said: "I feel this thine endearing love<br>
All through my bosom: thou art as a dove<br>
Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings<br>
About me; and the pearliest dew not brings<br>
Such morning incense from the fields of May,<span class="rmn">470</span><br>
As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray<br>
From those kind eyes,–the very home and haunt<br>
Of sisterly affection. Can I want<br>
Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?<br>
Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears<br>
<!-- Page 34 -->
That, any longer, I will pass my days<br>
Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise<br>
My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more<br>
Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:<br>
Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll<span class="rmn">480</span><br>
Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll<br>
The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:<br>
And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,<br>
Again I'll linger in a sloping mead<br>
To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed<br>
Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,<br>
And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat<br>
My soul to keep in its resolved course."<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Hereat Peona, in their silver source,</span><br>
Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,<span class="rmn">490</span><br>
And took a lute, from which there pulsing came<br>
A lively prelude, fashioning the way<br>
In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay<br>
More subtle cadenced, more forest wild<br>
Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;<br>
And nothing since has floated in the air<br>
<!-- Page 35 -->
So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare<br>
Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;<br>
For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd<br>
The quick invisible strings, even though she saw<span class="rmn">500</span><br>
Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw<br>
Before the deep intoxication.<br>
But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon<br>
Her self-possession–swung the lute aside,<br>
And earnestly said: "Brother, 'tis vain to hide<br>
That thou dost know of things mysterious,<br>
Immortal, starry; such alone could thus<br>
Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught<br>
Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught<br>
A Paphian dove upon a message sent?<span class="rmn">510</span><br>
Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,<br>
Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen<br>
Her naked limbs among the alders green;<br>
And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace<br>
Something more high perplexing in thy face!"<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,</span><br>
And said, "Art thou so pale, who wast so bland<br>
<!-- Page 36 -->
And merry in our meadows? How is this?<br>
Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!–<br>
Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change<span class="rmn">520</span><br>
Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?<br>
Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?<br>
Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,<br>
That toiling years would put within my grasp,<br>
That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp<br>
No man e'er panted for a mortal love.<br>
So all have set my heavier grief above<br>
These things which happen. Rightly have they done:<br>
I, who still saw the horizontal sun<br>
Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,<span class="rmn">530</span><br>
Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd<br>
My spear aloft, as signal for the chace–<br>
I, who, for very sport of heart, would race<br>
With my own steed from Araby; pluck down<br>
A vulture from his towery perching; frown<br>
A lion into growling, loth retire–<br>
To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,<br>
And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast<br>
Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.<br>

<p>
<span class="indented">"This river does not see the naked sky,</span><span class="rmn">540</span><br>
Till it begins to progress silverly<br>
Around the western border of the wood,<br>
Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood<br>
Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:<br>
And in that nook, the very pride of June,<br>
Had I been used to pass my weary eves;<br>
The rather for the sun unwilling leaves<br>
So dear a picture of his sovereign power,<br>
And I could witness his most kingly hour,<br>
When he doth lighten up the golden reins,<span class="rmn">550</span><br>
And paces leisurely down amber plains<br>
His snorting four. Now when his chariot last<br>
Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,<br>
There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed<br>
Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:<br>
At which I wondered greatly, knowing well<br>
That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;<br>
And, sitting down close by, began to muse<br>
What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,<br>
In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;<span class="rmn">560</span><br>
Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook<br>
<!-- Page 38 -->
Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,<br>
Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth<br>
Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,<br>
Until my head was dizzy and distraught.<br>
Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole<br>
A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;<br>
And shaping visions all about my sight<br>
Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;<br>
The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,<br>
And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:<span class="rmn">571</span><br>
And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell<br>
The enchantment that afterwards befel?<br>
Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream<br>
That never tongue, although it overteem<br>
With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,<br>
Could figure out and to conception bring<br>
All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay<br>
Watching the zenith, where the milky way<br>
Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;<span class="rmn">580</span><br>
And travelling my eye, until the doors<br>
Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,<br>
I became loth and fearful to alight<br>
<!-- Page 39 -->
From such high soaring by a downward glance:<br>
So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,<br>
Spreading imaginary pinions wide.<br>
When, presently, the stars began to glide,<br>
And faint away, before my eager view:<br>
At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,<br>
And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;<span class="rmn">590</span><br>
And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge<br>
The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er<br>
A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar<br>
So passionately bright, my dazzled soul<br>
Commingling with her argent spheres did roll<br>
Through clear and cloudy, even when she went<br>
At last into a dark and vapoury tent–<br>
Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train<br>
Of planets all were in the blue again.<br>
To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd<span class="rmn">600</span><br>
My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed<br>
By a bright something, sailing down apace,<br>
Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:<br>
Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,<br>
Who from Olympus watch our destinies!<br>
<!-- Page 40 -->
Whence that completed form of all completeness?<br>
Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?<br>
Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O where<br>
Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?<br>
Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;<span class="rmn">610</span><br>
Not–thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun<br>
Such follying before thee–yet she had,<br>
Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;<br>
And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,<br>
Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,<br>
Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;<br>
The which were blended in, I know not how,<br>
With such a paradise of lips and eyes,<br>
Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,<br>
That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings<span class="rmn">620</span><br>
And plays about its fancy, till the stings<br>
Of human neighbourhood envenom all.<br>
Unto what awful power shall I call?<br>
To what high fane?–Ah! see her hovering feet,<br>
More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet<br>
Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose<br>
From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows<br>
<!-- Page 41 -->
Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;<br>
'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million<br>
Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,<span class="rmn">630</span><br>
Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,<br>
Handfuls of daisies."–"Endymion, how strange!<br>
Dream within dream!"–"She took an airy range,<br>
And then, towards me, like a very maid,<br>
Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,<br>
And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;<br>
Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,<br>
Yet held my recollection, even as one<br>
Who dives three fathoms where the waters run<br>
Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,<span class="rmn">640</span><br>
I felt upmounted in that region<br>
Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,<br>
And eagles struggle with the buffeting north<br>
That balances the heavy meteor-stone;–<br>
Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,<br>
But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.<br>
Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,<br>
And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;<br>
Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd<br>
<!-- Page 42 -->
Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:<span class="rmn">650</span><br>
There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd<br>
To faint once more by looking on my bliss–<br>
I was distracted; madly did I kiss<br>
The wooing arms which held me, and did give<br>
My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,<br>
To take in draughts of life from the gold fount<br>
Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count<br>
The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd<br>
A second self, that each might be redeem'd<br>
And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.<span class="rmn">660</span><br>
Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press<br>
Her very cheek against my crowned lip,<br>
And, at that moment, felt my body dip<br>
Into a warmer air: a moment more,<br>
Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store<br>
Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes<br>
A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,<br>
Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,<br>
Made delicate from all white-flower bells;<br>
And once, above the edges of our nest,<span class="rmn">670</span><br>
An arch face peep'd,–an Oread as I guess'd.<br>

<p>
<span class="indented">"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me</span><br>
In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,<br>
Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,<br>
And stare them from me? But no, like a spark<br>
That needs must die, although its little beam<br>
Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream<br>
Fell into nothing–into stupid sleep.<br>
And so it was, until a gentle creep,<br>
A careful moving caught my waking ears,<span class="rmn">680</span><br>
And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,<br>
My clenched hands;–for lo! the poppies hung<br>
Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung<br>
A heavy ditty, and the sullen day<br>
Had chidden herald Hesperus away,<br>
With leaden looks: the solitary breeze<br>
Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze<br>
With wayward melancholy; and I thought,<br>
Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought<br>
Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!–<span class="rmn">690</span><br>
Away I wander'd–all the pleasant hues<br>
Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades<br>
Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades<br>
<!-- Page 44 -->
Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills<br>
Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills<br>
Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown<br>
In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown<br>
Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird<br>
Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd<br>
In little journeys, I beheld in it<span class="rmn">700</span><br>
A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit<br>
My soul with under darkness; to entice<br>
My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:<br>
Therefore I eager followed, and did curse<br>
The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,<br>
Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!<br>
These things, with all their comfortings, are given<br>
To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,<br>
Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea<br>

Sat silent: for the maid was very loth<br>
To answer; feeling well that breathed words<br>
Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords<br>
<!-- Page 45 -->
Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps<br>
Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,<br>
And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;<br>
To put on such a look as would say, <i>Shame<br>
On this poor weakness!</i> but, for all her strife,<br>
She could as soon have crush'd away the life<span class="rmn">720</span><br>
From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,<br>
She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?<br>
This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!<br>
That one who through this middle earth should pass<br>
Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave<br>
His name upon the harp-string, should achieve<br>
No higher bard than simple maidenhood,<br>
Singing alone, and fearfully,–how the blood<br>
Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray<br>
He knew not where; and how he would say, <i>nay</i>,<span class="rmn">730</span><br>
If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;<br>
What could it be but love? How a ring-dove<br>
Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;<br>
And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,<br>
The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;<br>
And then the ballad of his sad life closes<br>
<!-- Page 46 -->
With sighs, and an alas!–Endymion!<br>
Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,–anon<br>
Among the winds at large–that all may hearken!<br>
Although, before the crystal heavens darken,<span class="rmn">740</span><br>
I watch and dote upon the silver lakes<br>
Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes<br>
The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,<br>
Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands<br>
With horses prancing o'er them, palaces<br>
And towers of amethyst,–would I so tease<br>
My pleasant days, because I could not mount<br>
Into those regions? The Morphean fount<br>
Of that fine element that visions, dreams,<br>
And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams<span class="rmn">750</span><br>
Into its airy channels with so subtle,<br>
So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,<br>
Circled a million times within the space<br>
Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,<br>
A tinting of its quality: how light<br>
Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight<br>
Than the mere nothing that engenders them!<br>
Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem<br>
<!-- Page 47 -->
Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?<br>
Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick<span class="rmn">760</span><br>
For nothing but a dream?" Hereat the youth<br>
Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth<br>
Was in his plaited brow: yet, his eyelids<br>
Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids<br>
A little breeze to creep between the fans<br>
Of careless butterflies: amid his pains<br>
He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,<br>
Full palatable; and a colour grew<br>
Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Peona! ever have I long'd to slake</span><span class="rmn">770</span><br>
My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,<br>
No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace<br>
The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd–<br>
Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd<br>
And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope<br>
Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,<br>
To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.<br>
Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks<br>
Our ready minds to fellowship divine,<br>
<!-- Page 48 -->
A fellowship with essence; till we shine,<span class="rmn">780</span><br>
Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold<br>
The clear religion of heaven! Fold<br>
A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,<br>
And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress<br>
Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,<br>
And with a sympathetic touch unbinds<br>
Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:<br>
Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;<br>
Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;<br>
Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave<span class="rmn">790</span><br>
Round every spot were trod Apollo's foot;<br>
Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,<br>
Where long ago a giant battle was;<br>
And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass<br>
In every place where infant Orpheus slept.<br>
Feel we these things?–that moment have we stept<br>
Into a sort of oneness, and our state<br>
Is like a floating spirit's. But there are<br>
Richer entanglements, enthralments far<br>
More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,<span class="rmn">800</span><br>
To the chief intensity: the crown of these<br>
<!-- Page 49 -->
Is made of love and friendship, and sits high<br>
Upon the forehead of humanity.<br>
All its more ponderous and bulky worth<br>
Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth<br>
A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,<br>
There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop<br>
Of light, and that is love: its influence,<br>
Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,<br>
At which we start and fret; till in the end,<span class="rmn">810</span><br>
Melting into its radiance, we blend,<br>
Mingle, and so become a part of it,–<br>
Nor with aught else can our souls interknit<br>
So wingedly: when we combine therewith,<br>
Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,<br>
And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.<br>
Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,<br>
That men, who might have tower'd in the van<br>
Of all the congregated world, to fan<br>
And winnow from the coming step of time<span class="rmn">820</span><br>
All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime<br>
Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,<br>
Have been content to let occasion die,<br>
<!-- Page 50 -->
Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.<br>
And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,<br>
Than speak against this ardent listlessness:<br>
For I have ever thought that it might bless<br>
The world with benefits unknowingly;<br>
As does the nightingale, upperched high,<br>
And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves–<span class="rmn">830</span><br>
She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives<br>
How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.<br>
Just so may love, although 'tis understood<br>
The mere commingling of passionate breath,<br>
Produce more than our searching witnesseth:<br>
What I know not: but who, of men, can tell<br>
That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell<br>
To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,<br>
The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,<br>
The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,<span class="rmn">840</span><br>
The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,<br>
Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,<br>
If human souls did never kiss and greet?<br>
<!-- Page 51 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Now, if this earthly love has power to make</span><br>
Men's being mortal, immortal; to shake<br>
Ambition from their memories, and brim<br>
Their measure of content; what merest whim,<br>
Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,<br>
To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim<br>
A love immortal, an immortal too.<span class="rmn">850</span><br>
Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,<br>
And never can be born of atomies<br>
That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,<br>
Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,<br>
My restless spirit never could endure<br>
To brood so long upon one luxury,<br>
Unless it did, though fearfully, espy<br>
A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.<br>
My sayings will the less obscured seem,<br>
When I have told thee how my waking sight<span class="rmn">860</span><br>
Has made me scruple whether that same night<br>
Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!<br>
Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,<br>
Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,<br>
Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows<br>
<!-- Page 52 -->
Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,<br>
And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,<br>
And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide<br>
Past them, but he must brush on every side.<br>
Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,<span class="rmn">870</span><br>
Far as the slabbed margin of a well,<br>
Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye<br>
Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.<br>
Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set<br>
Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet<br>
Edges them round, and they have golden pits:<br>
'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits<br>
In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,<br>
When all above was faint with mid-day heat.<br>
And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,<span class="rmn">880</span><br>
I'd bubble up the water through a reed;<br>
So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships<br>
Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,<br>
With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be<br>
Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,<br>
When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,<br>
I sat contemplating the figures wild<br>
<!-- Page 53 -->
Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.<br>
Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew<br>
A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;<span class="rmn">890</span><br>
So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver<br>
The happy chance: so happy, I was fain<br>
To follow it upon the open plain,<br>
And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!<br>
A wonder, fair as any I have told–<br>
The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,<br>
Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap<br>
Through the cool depth.–It moved as if to flee–<br>
I started up, when lo! refreshfully,<br>
There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,<span class="rmn">900</span><br>
Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,<br>
Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,<br>
Bathing my spirit in a new delight.<br>
Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss<br>
Alone preserved me from the drear abyss<br>
Of death, for the fair form had gone again.<br>
Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain<br>
Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth<br>
On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,<br>
<!-- Page 54 -->
'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.<span class="rmn">910</span><br>
How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure<br>
Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,<br>
By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!<br>
Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,<br>
Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:<br>
And a whole age of lingering moments crept<br>
Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept<br>
Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.<br>
Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;<br>
Once more been tortured with renewed life.<span class="rmn">920</span><br>
When last the wintry gusts gave over strife<br>
With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies<br>
Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes<br>
In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,–<br>
That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,<br>
My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,<br>
Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd<br>
All torment from my breast;–'twas even then,<br>
Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den<br>
Of helpless discontent,–hurling my lance<span class="rmn">930</span><br>
From place to place, and following at chance,<br>
<!-- Page 55 -->
At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,<br>
And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck<br>
In the middle of a brook,–whose silver ramble<br>
Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,<br>
Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,<br>
Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave<br>
The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,–<br>
'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock<br>
Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,<span class="rmn">940</span><br>
Hung a lush scene of drooping weeds, and spread<br>
Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.<br>
"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?"<br>
Said I, low voic'd: "Ah, whither! 'Tis the grot<br>
Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,<br>
Doth her resign; and where her tender hands<br>
She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:<br>
Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,<br>
And babbles thorough silence, till her wits<br>
Are gone in tender madness, and anon,<span class="rmn">950</span><br>
Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone<br>
Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,<br>
And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,<br>
<!-- Page 56 -->
To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,<br>
Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,<br>
And weave them dyingly–send honey-whispers<br>
Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers<br>
May sigh my love unto her pitying!<br>
O charitable echo! hear, and sing<br>
This ditty to her!–tell her"–so I stay'd<span class="rmn">960</span><br>
My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,<br>
Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,<br>
And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.<br>
Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name<br>
Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:<br>
"Endymion! the cave is secreter<br>
Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir<br>
No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise<br>
Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys<br>
And trembles through my labyrinthine hair."<span class="rmn">970</span><br>
At that oppress'd I hurried in.–Ah! where<br>
Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?<br>
I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed<br>
Sorrow the way to death; but patiently<br>
Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;<br>
<!-- Page 57 -->
And come instead demurest meditation,<br>
To occupy me wholly, and to fashion<br>
My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.<br>
No more will I count over, link by link,<br>
My chain of grief: no longer strive to find<span class="rmn">980</span><br>
A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind<br>
Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,<br>
Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;<br>
What a calm round of hours shall make my days.<br>
There is a paly flame of hope that plays<br>
Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught–<br>
And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,<br>
Already, a more healthy countenance?<br>
By this the sun is setting; we may chance<br>
Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."<span class="rmn">990</span><br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star</span><br>
Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:<br>
They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.<br>

BOOK II.

<p>
O sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!<br>
All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,<br>
And shadowy, through the mist of passed years:<br>
For others, good or bad, hatred and tears<br>
Have become indolent; but touching thine,<br>
One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,<br>
One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.<br>
The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,<br>
Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,<br>
Struggling, and blood, and shrieks–all dimly fades<span class="rmn">10</span><br>
<!-- Page 61 -->
Into some backward corner of the brain;<br>
Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain<br>
The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.<br>
Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!<br>
Swart planet in the universe of deeds!<br>
Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds<br>
Along the pebbled shore of memory!<br>
Many old rotten-timber'd boats there be<br>
Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified<br>
To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,<span class="rmn">20</span><br>
And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.<br>
But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly<br>
About the great Athenian admiral's mast?<br>
What care, though striding Alexander past<br>
The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?<br>
Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers<br>
The glutted Cyclops, what care?–Juliet leaning<br>
Amid her window-flowers,–sighing,–weaning<br>
Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,<br>
Doth more avail than these: the silver flow<span class="rmn">30</span><br>
Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,<br>
Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,<br>
<!-- Page 62 -->
Are things to brood on with more ardency<br>
Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully<br>
Must such conviction come upon his head,<br>
Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,<br>
Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,<br>
The path of love and poesy. But rest,<br>
In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear<br>
Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear<span class="rmn">40</span><br>
Love's standard on the battlements of song.<br>
So once more days and nights aid me along,<br>

What promise hast thou faithful guarded since<br>
The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows<br>
Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?<br>
Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,<br>
Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:<br>
Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;<span class="rmn">50</span><br>
Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes<br>
Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,<br>
Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.<br>
<!-- Page 63 -->
Now he is sitting by a shady spring,<br>
And elbow-deep with feverous fingering<br>
Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree<br>
Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see<br>
A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now<br>
He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!<br>
It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;<span class="rmn">60</span><br>
And, in the middle, there is softly pight<br>
A golden butterfly; upon whose wings<br>
There must be surely character'd strange things,<br>
For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Lightly this little herald flew aloft,</span><br>
Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:<br>
Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands<br>
His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies<br>
Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.<br>
It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;<span class="rmn">70</span><br>
And like a new-born spirit did he pass<br>
Through the green evening quiet in the sun,<br>
O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,<br>
<!-- Page 64 -->
Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams<br>
The summer time away. One track unseams<br>
A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue<br>
Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,<br>
He sinks adown a solitary glen,<br>
Where there was never sound of mortal men,<br>
Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences<span class="rmn">80</span><br>
Melting to silence, when upon the breeze<br>
Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,<br>
To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet<br>
Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,<br>
Until it reached a splashing fountain's side<br>
That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd<br>
Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,<br>
And, downward, suddenly began to dip,<br>
As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip<br>
The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch<span class="rmn">90</span><br>
Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch<br>
Even with mealy gold the waters clear.<br>
But, at that very touch, to disappear<br>
So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,<br>
Endymion sought around, and shook each bed<br>
<!-- Page 65 -->
Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung<br>
Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,<br>
What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?<br>
It was a nymph uprisen to the breast<br>
In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood<span class="rmn">100</span><br>
'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.<br>
To him her dripping hand she softly kist,<br>
And anxiously began to plait and twist<br>
Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: "Youth!<br>
Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,<br>
The bitterness of love: too long indeed,<br>
Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed<br>
Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer<br>
All the bright riches of my crystal coffer<br>
To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,<span class="rmn">110</span><br>
Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,<br>
Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;<br>
Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws<br>
A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands<br>
Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands<br>
By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,<br>
My charming rod, my potent river spells;<br>
<!-- Page 66 -->
Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup<br>
Meander gave me,–for I bubbled up<br>
To fainting creatures in a desert wild.<span class="rmn">120</span><br>
But woe is me, I am but as a child<br>
To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,<br>
Is, that I pity thee; that on this day<br>
I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far<br>
In other regions, past the scanty bar<br>
To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en<br>
From every wasting sigh, from every pain,<br>
Into the gentle bosom of thy love.<br>
Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:<br>
But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!<span class="rmn">130</span><br>
I have a ditty for my hollow cell."<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,</span><br>
Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:<br>
The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool<br>
Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,<br>
Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,<br>
And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill<br>
Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,<br>
<!-- Page 67 -->
Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr<br>
Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;<span class="rmn">140</span><br>
And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown<br>
Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,<br>
Thus breath'd he to himself: "Whoso encamps<br>
To take a fancied city of delight,<br>
O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,<br>
After long toil and travelling, to miss<br>
The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:<br>
Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;<br>
Another city doth he set about,<br>
Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt<span class="rmn">150</span><br>
That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:<br>
Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,<br>
And onward to another city speeds.<br>
But this is human life: the war, the deeds,<br>
The disappointment, the anxiety,<br>
Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,<br>
All human; bearing in themselves this good,<br>
That they are still the air, the subtle food,<br>
To make us feel existence, and to shew<br>
How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,<span class="rmn">160</span><br>
<!-- Page 68 -->
Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,<br>
There is no depth to strike in: I can see<br>
Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand<br>
Upon a misty, jutting head of land–<br>
Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,<br>
When mad Eurydice is listening to't;<br>
I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,<br>
With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,<br>
But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,<br>
Than be–I care not what. O meekest dove<span class="rmn">170</span><br>
Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!<br>
From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,<br>
Glance but one little beam of temper'd light<br>
Into my bosom, that the dreadful might<br>
And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!<br>
Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,<br>
Would give a pang to jealous misery,<br>
Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie<br>
Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out<br>
My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout<span class="rmn">180</span><br>
Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,<br>
Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow<br>
<!-- Page 69 -->
Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.<br>
O be propitious, nor severely deem<br>
My madness impious; for, by all the stars<br>
That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars<br>
That kept my spirit in are burst–that I<br>
Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!<br>
How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!<br>
How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep<span class="rmn">190</span><br>
Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,<br>
How lithe! When this thy chariot attains<br>
Its airy goal, haply some bower veils<br>
Those twilight eyes?–Those eyes!–my spirit fails–<br>
Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air<br>
Will gulph me–help!"–At this with madden'd stare,<br>
And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;<br>
Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,<br>
Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.<br>
And, but from the deep cavern there was borne<span class="rmn">200</span><br>
A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;<br>
Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan<br>
Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: "Descend,<br>
Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend<br>
<!-- Page 70 -->
Into the sparry hollows of the world!<br>
Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd<br>
As from thy threshold; day by day hast been<br>
A little lower than the chilly sheen<br>
Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms<br>
Into the deadening ether that still charms<span class="rmn">210</span><br>
Their marble being: now, as deep profound<br>
As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd<br>
With immortality, who fears to follow<br>
Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,<br>
The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">He heard but the last words, nor could contend</span><br>
One moment in reflection: for he fled<br>
Into the fearful deep, to hide his head<br>
From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;</span><br>
Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite<span class="rmn">221</span><br>
To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,<br>
The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,<br>
But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;<br>
<!-- Page 71 -->
A dusky empire and its diadems;<br>
One faint eternal eventide of gems.<br>
Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,<br>
Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,<br>
With all its lines abrupt and angular:<br>
Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,<span class="rmn">230</span><br>
Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,<br>
Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof<br>
Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,<br>
It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss<br>
Fancy into belief: anon it leads<br>
Through winding passages, where sameness breeds<br>
Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;<br>
Whether to silver grots, or giant range<br>
Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge<br>
Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge<span class="rmn">240</span><br>
Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath<br>
Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth<br>
A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come<br>
But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb<br>
His bosom grew, when first he, far away,<br>
Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray<br>
<!-- Page 72 -->
Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun<br>
Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun<br>
Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,<br>
He saw not fiercer wonders–past the wit<span class="rmn">250</span><br>
Of any spirit to tell, but one of those<br>
Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,<br>
Will be its high remembrancers: who they?<br>
The mighty ones who have made eternal day<br>
For Greece and England. While astonishment<br>
With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went<br>
Into a marble gallery, passing through<br>
A mimic temple, so complete and true<br>
In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd<br>
To search it inwards; whence far off appear'd,<span class="rmn">260</span><br>
Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,<br>
And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,<br>
A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,<br>
The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye<br>
Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.<br>
And when, more near against the marble cold<br>
He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread<br>
All courts and passages, where silence dead<br>
<!-- Page 73 -->
Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:<br>
And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint<span class="rmn">270</span><br>
Himself with every mystery, and awe;<br>
Till, weary, he sat down before the maw<br>
Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim<br>
To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.<br>
There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,<br>
And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore<br>
The journey homeward to habitual self!<br>
A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,<br>
Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,<br>
Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,<span class="rmn">280</span><br>
Into the bosom of a hated thing.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">What misery most drowningly doth sing</span><br>
In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught<br>
The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,<br>
The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!<br>
He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow<br>
Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild<br>
In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,<br>
The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,<br>
<!-- Page 74 -->
Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest<span class="rmn">290</span><br>
Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;<br>
But far from such companionship to wear<br>
An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,<br>
Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,<br>
Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?<br>
"No!" exclaimed he, "why should I tarry here?"<br>
No! loudly echoed times innumerable.<br>
At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell<br>
His paces back into the temple's chief;<br>
Warming and growing strong in the belief<span class="rmn">300</span><br>
Of help from Dian: so that when again<br>
He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,<br>
Moving more near the while. "O Haunter chaste<br>
Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,<br>
Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen<br>
Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,<br>
What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?<br>
Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos<br>
Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree<br>
Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,<span class="rmn">310</span><br>
'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste<br>
<!-- Page 75 -->
Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste<br>
Thy loveliness in dismal elements;<br>
But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,<br>
There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee<br>
It feels Elysian, how rich to me,<br>
An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!<br>
Within my breast there lives a choking flame–<br>
O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!<br>
A homeward fever parches up my tongue–<span class="rmn">320</span><br>
O let me slake it at the running springs!<br>
Upon my car a noisy nothing rings–<br>
O let me once more hear the linnet's note!<br>
Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float–<br>
O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!<br>
Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?<br>
O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!<br>
Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?<br>
O think how this dry palate would rejoice!<br>
If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,<span class="rmn">330</span><br>
O think how I should love a bed of flowers!–<br>
Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!<br>
Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"<br>
<!-- Page 76 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap</span><br>
His destiny, alert he stood: but when<br>
Obstinate silence came heavily again,<br>
Feeling about for its old couch of space<br>
And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face<br>
Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.<br>
But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill<span class="rmn">340</span><br>
To its old channel, or a swollen tide<br>
To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,<br>
And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns<br>
Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns<br>
Itself, and strives its own delights to hide–<br>
Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride<br>
In a long whispering birth enchanted grew<br>
Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew<br>
Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,<br>
Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,<br>
Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.<span class="rmn">351</span><br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,</span><br>
Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;<br>
<!-- Page 77 -->
So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes<br>
One moment with his hand among the sweets:<br>
Onward he goes–he stops–his bosom beats<br>
As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm<br>
Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,<br>
This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:<br>
For it came more softly than the east could blow<span class="rmn">360</span><br>
Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;<br>
Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles<br>
Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre<br>
To seas Ionian and Tyrian.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">O did he ever live, that lonely man,</span><br>
Who lov'd–and music slew not? 'Tis the pest<br>
Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;<br>
That things of delicate and tenderest worth<br>
Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,<br>
By one consuming flame: it doth immerse<span class="rmn">370</span><br>
And suffocate true blessings in a curse.<br>
Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,<br>
Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this<br>
<!-- Page 78 -->
Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;<br>
First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,<br>
Vanish'd in elemental passion.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">And down some swart abysm he had gone,</span><br>
Had not a heavenly guide benignant led<br>
To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head<br>
Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again<span class="rmn">380</span><br>
Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain<br>
Over a bower, where little space he stood;<br>
For as the sunset peeps into a wood<br>
So saw he panting light, and towards it went<br>
Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!<br>
Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,<br>
Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">After a thousand mazes overgone,</span><br>
At last, with sudden step, he came upon<br>
A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,<span class="rmn">390</span><br>
Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,<br>
And more of beautiful and strange beside:<br>
For on a silken couch of rosy pride,<br>
<!-- Page 79 -->
In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth<br>
Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,<br>
Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:<br>
And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,<br>
Or ripe October's faded marigolds,<br>
Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds–<br>
Not hiding up an Apollonian curve<span class="rmn">400</span><br>
Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve<br>
Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;<br>
But rather, giving them to the filled sight<br>
Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd<br>
On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,<br>
By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth<br>
To slumbery pout; just as the morning south<br>
Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,<br>
Four lily stalks did their white honours wed<br>
To make a coronal; and round him grew<span class="rmn">410</span><br>
All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,<br>
Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:<br>
The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,<br>
Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,<br>
Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;<br>
<!-- Page 80 -->
Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;<br>
The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;<br>
And virgin's bower, trailing airily;<br>
With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,<br>
Stood serene Cupids watching silently.<span class="rmn">420</span><br>
One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,<br>
Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;<br>
And, ever and anon, uprose to look<br>
At the youth's slumber; while another took<br>
A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,<br>
And shook it on his hair; another flew<br>
In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise<br>
Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">At these enchantments, and yet many more,</span><br>
The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;<span class="rmn">430</span><br>
Until, impatient in embarrassment,<br>
He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went<br>
To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,<br>
Smiling, thus whisper'd: "Though from upper day<br>
Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here<br>
Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!<br>
<!-- Page 81 -->
For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,<br>
When some ethereal and high-favouring donor<br>
Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;<br>
As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence<span class="rmn">440</span><br>
Was I in no wise startled. So recline<br>
Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,<br>
Alive with sparkles–never, I aver,<br>
Since Ariadne was a vintager,<br>
So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,<br>
Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears<br>
Were high about Pomona: here is cream,<br>
Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;<br>
Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd<br>
For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd<span class="rmn">450</span><br>
By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums<br>
Ready to melt between an infant's gums:<br>
And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,<br>
In starlight, by the three Hesperides.<br>
Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know<br>
Of all these things around us." He did so,<br>
Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;<br>
And thus: "I need not any hearing tire<br>
<!-- Page 82 -->
By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd<br>
For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind<span class="rmn">460</span><br>
Him all in all unto her doting self.<br>
Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,<br>
He was content to let her amorous plea<br>
Faint through his careless arms; content to see<br>
An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;<br>
Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,<br>
When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,<br>
Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born<br>
Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes<br>
Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs<span class="rmn">470</span><br>
Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.<br>
Hush! no exclaim–yet, justly mightst thou call<br>
Curses upon his head.–I was half glad,<br>
But my poor mistress went distract and mad,<br>
When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew<br>
To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew<br>
Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;<br>
Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd<br>
Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,<br>
That same Adonis, safe in the privacy<span class="rmn">480</span><br>
<!-- Page 83 -->
Of this still region all his winter-sleep.<br>
Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep<br>
Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower<br>
Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,<br>
Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:<br>
The which she fills with visions, and doth dress<br>
In all this quiet luxury; and hath set<br>
Us young immortals, without any let,<br>
To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,<br>
Even to a moment's filling up, and fast<span class="rmn">490</span><br>
She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through<br>
The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew<br>
Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.<br>
Look! how those winged listeners all this while<br>
Stand anxious: see! behold!"–This clamant word<br>
Broke through the careful silence; for they heard<br>
A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd<br>
Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,<br>
The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh<br>
Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually<span class="rmn">500</span><br>
Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum<br>
Of sudden voices, echoing, "Come! come!<br>
<!-- Page 84 -->
Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd<br>
Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd<br>
Full soothingly to every nested finch:<br>
Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch<br>
To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"<br>
At this, from every side they hurried in,<br>
Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,<br>
And doubling over head their little fists<span class="rmn">510</span><br>
In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:<br>
For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive<br>
In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,<br>
So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air<br>
Odorous and enlivening; making all<br>
To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call<br>
For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green<br>
Disparted, and far upward could be seen<br>
Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,<br>
Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,<br>
Spun off a drizzling dew,–which falling chill<span class="rmn">521</span><br>
On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still<br>
Nestle and turn uneasily about.<br>
Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,<br>
<!-- Page 85 -->
And silken traces lighten'd in descent;<br>
And soon, returning from love's banishment,<br>
Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:<br>
Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd<br>
A tumult to his heart, and a new life<br>
Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,<span class="rmn">530</span><br>
But for her comforting! unhappy sight,<br>
But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write<br>
Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse<br>
To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">O it has ruffled every spirit there,</span><br>
Saving love's self, who stands superb to share<br>
The general gladness: awfully he stands;<br>
A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;<br>
No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;<br>
His quiver is mysterious, none can know<span class="rmn">540</span><br>
What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes<br>
There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:<br>
A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who<br>
Look full upon it feel anon the blue<br>
Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.<br>
<!-- Page 86 -->
Endymion feels it, and no more controls<br>
The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,<br>
He had begun a plaining of his woe.<br>
But Venus, bending forward, said: "My child,<br>
Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild<span class="rmn">550</span><br>
With love–he–but alas! too well I see<br>
Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.<br>
Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,<br>
That when through heavy hours I used to rue<br>
The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',<br>
This stranger ay I pitied. For upon<br>
A dreary morning once I fled away<br>
Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray<br>
For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd<br>
Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,<span class="rmn">560</span><br>
Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,<br>
I saw this youth as he despairing stood:<br>
Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;<br>
Those same full fringed lids a constant blind<br>
Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw<br>
Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though<br>
Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,<br>
<!-- Page 87 -->
Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd<br>
Some fair immortal, and that his embrace<br>
Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace<span class="rmn">570</span><br>
Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,<br>
And find it is the vainest thing to seek;<br>
And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.<br>
Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:<br>
So still obey the guiding hand that fends<br>
Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.<br>
'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;<br>
And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam<br>
Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!<br>
Here must we leave thee."–At these words up flew<span class="rmn">580</span><br>
The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,<br>
Up went the hum celestial. High afar<br>
The Latmian saw them minish into nought;<br>
And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught<br>
A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.<br>
When all was darkened, with Etnean throe<br>
The earth clos'd–gave a solitary moan–<br>
And left him once again in twilight lone.<br>
<!-- Page 88 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,</span><br>
For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,<span class="rmn">590</span><br>
And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd<br>
Of happy times, when all he had endur'd<br>
Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.<br>
So, with unusual gladness, on he hies<br>
Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,<br>
Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,<br>
Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,<br>
And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,<br>
Leading afar past wild magnificence,<br>
Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence<span class="rmn">600</span><br>
Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er<br>
Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,<br>
Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;<br>
Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads<br>
Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash<br>
The waters with his spear; but at the splash,<br>
Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose<br>
Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose<br>
His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round<br>
Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,<span class="rmn">610</span><br>
<!-- Page 89 -->
Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells<br>
Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells<br>
On this delight; for, every minute's space,<br>
The streams with changed magic interlace:<br>
Sometimes like delicatest lattices,<br>
Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,<br>
Moving about as in a gentle wind,<br>
Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,<br>
Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,<br>
Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries<span class="rmn">620</span><br>
Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.<br>
Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;<br>
And then the water, into stubborn streams<br>
Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,<br>
Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,<br>
Of those dusk places in times far aloof<br>
Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel<br>
To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,<br>
And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,<br>
Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,<span class="rmn">630</span><br>
Blackening on every side, and overhead<br>
A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread<br>
<!-- Page 90 -->
With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,<br>
The solitary felt a hurried change<br>
Working within him into something dreary,–<br>
Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,<br>
And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.<br>
But he revives at once: for who beholds<br>
New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?<br>
Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,<span class="rmn">640</span><br>
Came mother Cybele! alone–alone–<br>
In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown<br>
About her majesty, and front death-pale,<br>
With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale<br>
The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,<br>
Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws<br>
Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails<br>
Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails<br>
This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away<br>

Young traveller, in such a mournful place?<br>
Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace<br>
<!-- Page 91 -->
The diamond path? And does it indeed end<br>
Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend<br>
Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne<br>
Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;<br>
Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;<br>
To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost<br>
Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,<span class="rmn">660</span><br>
Without one impious word, himself he flings,<br>
Committed to the darkness and the gloom:<br>
Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,<br>
Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell<br>
Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,<br>
And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,<br>
Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd<br>
So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd<br>
Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd<br>
With airs delicious. In the greenest nook<span class="rmn">670</span><br>
The eagle landed him, and farewel took.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown</span><br>
With golden moss. His every sense had grown<br>
<!-- Page 92 -->
Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head<br>
Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread<br>
Was Hesperean; to his capable ears<br>
Silence was music from the holy spheres;<br>
A dewy luxury was in his eyes;<br>
The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs<br>
And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell<span class="rmn">680</span><br>
He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell<br>
Of sudden exaltation: but, "Alas!<br>
Said he, "will all this gush of feeling pass<br>
Away in solitude? And must they wane,<br>
Like melodies upon a sandy plain,<br>
Without an echo? Then shall I be left<br>
So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!<br>
Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,<br>
My breath of life, where art thou? High above,<br>
Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?<span class="rmn">690</span><br>
Or keeping watch among those starry seven,<br>
Old Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,<br>
One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?<br>
Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,<br>
Weaving a coronal of tender scions<br>
<!-- Page 93 -->
For very idleness? Where'er thou art,<br>
Methinks it now is at my will to start<br>
Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,<br>
And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main<br>
To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off<span class="rmn">700</span><br>
From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff<br>
Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.<br>
No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives<br>
Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.<br>
O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee<br>
To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!<br>
Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil<br>
For some few hours the coming solitude."<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued</span><br>
With power to dream deliciously; so wound<span class="rmn">710</span><br>
Through a dim passage, searching till he found<br>
The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where<br>
He threw himself, and just into the air<br>
Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!<br>
A naked waist: "Fair Cupid, whence is this?"<br>
<!-- Page 94 -->
A well-known voice sigh'd, "Sweetest, here am I!"<br>
At which soft ravishment, with doating cry<br>
They trembled to each other.–Helicon!<br>
O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!<br>
That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er<span class="rmn">720</span><br>
These sorry pages; then the verse would soar<br>
And sing above this gentle pair, like lark<br>
Over his nested young: but all is dark<br>
Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount<br>
Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count<br>
Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll<br>
Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll<br>
Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes<br>
Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:<br>
The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,<span class="rmn">730</span><br>
Although the sun of poesy is set,<br>
These lovers did embrace, and we must weep<br>
That there is no old power left to steep<br>
A quill immortal in their joyous tears.<br>
Long time in silence did their anxious fears<br>
Question that thus it was; long time they lay<br>
Fondling and kissing every doubt away;<br>
<!-- Page 95 -->
Long time ere soft caressing sobs began<br>
To mellow into words, and then there ran<br>
Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.<span class="rmn">740</span><br>
"O known Unknown! from whom my being sips<br>
Such darling essence, wherefore may I not<br>
Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot<br>
Pillow my chin for ever? ever press<br>
These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?<br>
Why not for ever and for ever feel<br>
That breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal<br>
Away from me again, indeed, indeed–<br>
Thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed<br>
My lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!<span class="rmn">750</span><br>
Is–is it to be so? No! Who will dare<br>
To pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,<br>
Full well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still<br>
Let me entwine thee surer, surer–now<br>
How can we part? Elysium! who art thou?<br>
Who, that thou canst not be for ever here,<br>
Or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?<br>
Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,<br>
By the most soft completion of thy face,<br>
<!-- Page 96 -->
Those lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,<span class="rmn">760</span><br>
And by these tenderest, milky sovereignties–<br>
These tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,<br>
The passion"—"O lov'd Ida the divine!<br>
Endymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!<br>
His soul will 'scape us–O felicity!<br>
How he does love me! His poor temples beat<br>
To the very tune of love–how sweet, sweet, sweet.<br>
Revive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;<br>
Revive, or these soft hours will hurry by<br>
In tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell<span class="rmn">770</span><br>
Affright this lethargy! I cannot quell<br>
Its heavy pressure, and will press at least<br>
My lips to thine, that they may richly feast<br>
Until we taste the life of love again.<br>
What! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!<br>
I love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;<br>
And so long absence from thee doth bereave<br>
My soul of any rest: yet must I hence:<br>
Yet, can I not to starry eminence<br>
Uplift thee; nor for very shame can own<span class="rmn">780</span><br>
Myself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan<br>
<!-- Page 97 -->
Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,<br>
And I must blush in heaven. O that I<br>
Had done it already; that the dreadful smiles<br>
At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,<br>
Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,<br>
And from all serious Gods; that our delight<br>
Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!<br>
And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone<br>
For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:<span class="rmn">790</span><br>
Yet must I be a coward!–Honour rushes<br>
Too palpable before me–the sad look<br>
Of Jove–Minerva's start–no bosom shook<br>
With awe of purity–no Cupid pinion<br>
In reverence veiled–my <a id="tn1"></a>crystalline dominion<br>
Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!<br>
But what is this to love? O I could fly<br>
With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,<br>
So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,<br>
Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once<span class="rmn">800</span><br>
That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce–<br>
Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown–<br>
O I do think that I have been alone<br>
<!-- Page 98 -->
In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,<br>
While every eye saw me my hair uptying<br>
With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,<br>
I was as vague as solitary dove,<br>
Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss–<br>
Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,<br>
An immortality of passion's thine:<span class="rmn">810</span><br>
Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine<br>
Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade<br>
Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;<br>
And I will tell thee stories of the sky,<br>
And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.<br>
My happy love will overwing all bounds!<br>
O let me melt into thee; let the sounds<br>
Of our close voices marry at their birth;<br>
Let us entwine hoveringly–O dearth<br>
Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!<span class="rmn">820</span><br>
Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach<br>
Thine honied tongue–lute-breathings, which I gasp<br>
To have thee understand, now while I clasp<br>
Thee thus, and weep for fondness–I am pain'd,<br>
Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd<br>
<!-- Page 99 -->
In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"–<br>

With too much passion, will here stay and pity,<br>
For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty<br>
Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told<br>
By a cavern wind unto a forest old;<br>
And then the forest told it in a dream<br>
To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam<br>
A poet caught as he was journeying<br>
To Phœbus' shrine; and in it he did fling<br>
His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,<br>
And after, straight in that inspired place<span class="rmn">840</span><br>
He sang the story up into the air,<br>
Giving it universal freedom. There<br>
Has it been ever sounding for those ears<br>
Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers<br>
Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it<br>
Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:<br>
<!-- Page 100 -->
For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,<br>
Made fiercer by a fear lest any part<br>
Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.<br>
As much as here is penn'd doth always find<span class="rmn">850</span><br>
A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;<br>
Anon the strange voice is upon the wane–<br>
And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,<br>
That the fair visitant at last unwound<br>
Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.–<br>
Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Now turn we to our former chroniclers.–</span><br>
Endymion awoke, that grief of hers<br>
Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd<br>
How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd<span class="rmn">860</span><br>
His empty arms together, hung his head,<br>
And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed<br>
Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:<br>
Often with more than tortured lion's groan<br>
Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage<br>
Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage<br>
<!-- Page 101 -->
A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.<br>
No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:<br>
The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd<br>
Forgot all violence, and but commun'd<span class="rmn">870</span><br>
With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd<br>
Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love<br>
Henceforth was dove-like.–Loth was he to move<br>
From the imprinted couch, and when he did,<br>
'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid<br>
In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd<br>
Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd<br>
Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen<br>
Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean<br>
Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last<span class="rmn">880</span><br>
It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,<br>
O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,<br>
And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,<br>
Of every shape and size, even to the bulk<br>
In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk<br>
Against an endless storm. Moreover too,<br>
Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,<br>
<!-- Page 102 -->
Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder<br>
Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder<br>
On all his life: his youth, up to the day<span class="rmn">890</span><br>
When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,<br>
He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look<br>
Of his white palace in wild forest nook,<br>
And all the revels he had lorded there:<br>
Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,<br>
With every friend and fellow-woodlander–<br>
Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur<br>
Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans<br>
To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:<br>
That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:<span class="rmn">900</span><br>
His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,<br>
Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:<br>
Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd<br>
High with excessive love. "And now," thought he,<br>
"How long must I remain in jeopardy<br>
Of blank amazements that amaze no more?<br>
Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core<br>
All other depths are shallow: essences,<br>
Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,<br>
<!-- Page 103 -->
Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,<span class="rmn">910</span><br>
And make my branches lift a golden fruit<br>
Into the bloom of heaven: other light,<br>
Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight<br>
The Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,<br>
Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!<br>
My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;<br>
Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells<br>
Of noises far away?–list!"–Hereupon<br>
He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone<br>
Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,<span class="rmn">920</span><br>
On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,<br>
A copious spring; and both together dash'd<br>
Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd<br>
Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,<br>
Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot<br>
Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise<br>
As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize<br>
Upon the last few steps, and with spent force<br>
Along the ground they took a winding course.<br>
Endymion follow'd–for it seem'd that one<span class="rmn">930</span><br>
Ever pursued, the other strove to shun–<br>
<!-- Page 104 -->
Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh<br>
He had left thinking of the mystery,–<br>
And was now rapt in tender hoverings<br>
Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings<br>
His dream away? What melodies are these?<br>
They sound as through the whispering of trees,<br>
Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear</span><br>
Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,<span class="rmn">940</span><br>
Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I<br>
Were rippling round her dainty fairness now,<br>
Circling about her waist, and striving how<br>
To entice her to a dive! then stealing in<br>
Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.<br>
O that her shining hair was in the sun,<br>
And I distilling from it thence to run<br>
In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!<br>
To linger on her lily shoulders, warm<br>
Between her kissing breasts, and every charm<span class="rmn">950</span><br>
Touch raptur'd!–See how painfully I flow:<br>
Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.<br>
<!-- Page 105 -->
Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,<br>
A happy wooer, to the flowery mead<br>
Where all that beauty snar'd me."–"Cruel god,<br>
Desist! or my offended mistress' nod<br>
Will stagnate all thy fountains:–tease me not<br>
With syren words–Ah, have I really got<br>
Such power to madden thee? And is it true–<br>
Away, away, or I shall dearly rue<span class="rmn">960</span><br>
My very thoughts: in mercy then away,<br>
Kindest Alpheus, for should I obey<br>
My own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane."–<br>
"O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain<br>
Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn<br>
And be a criminal."–"Alas, I burn,<br>
I shudder–gentle river, get thee hence.<br>
Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense<br>
Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.<br>
Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,<span class="rmn">970</span><br>
Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;<br>
But ever since I heedlessly did lave<br>
In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow<br>
Grew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,<br>
<!-- Page 106 -->
And call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.<br>
Not once more did I close my happy eyes<br>
Amid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!<br>
O 'twas a cruel thing."–"Now thou dost taunt<br>
So softly, Arethusa, that I think<br>
If thou wast playing on my shady brink,<span class="rmn">980</span><br>
Thou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!<br>
Stifle thine heart no more:–nor be afraid<br>
Of angry powers: there are deities<br>
Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs<br>
'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour<br>
A dewy balm upon them!–fear no more,<br>
Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel<br>
Sometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal<br>
Blushing into my soul, and let us fly<br>
These dreary caverns for the open sky.<span class="rmn">990</span><br>
I will delight thee all my winding course,<br>
From the green sea up to my hidden source<br>
About Arcadian forests; and will shew<br>
The channels where my coolest waters flow<br>
Through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,<br>
I roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen<br>
<!-- Page 107 -->
Than Saturn in his exile; where I brim<br>
Round flowery islands, and take thence a skim<br>
Of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees<br>
Buzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please<br>
Thyself to choose the richest, where we might<span class="rmn">1001</span><br>
Be incense-pillow'd every summer night.<br>
Doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,<br>
And let us be thus comforted; unless<br>
Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream<br>
Hurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,<br>
And pour to death along some hungry sands."–<br>
"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands<br>
Severe before me: persecuting fate!<br>
Unhappy Arethusa! thou wast late<span class="rmn">1010</span><br>
A huntress free in"–At this, sudden fell<br>
Those two sad streams adown a fearful dell.<br>
The Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,<br>
Save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er<br>
The name of Arethusa. On the verge<br>
Of that dark gulph he wept, and said: "I urge<br>
Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,<br>
By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,<br>
<!-- Page 108 -->
If thou art powerful, these lovers pains;<br>
And make them happy in some happy plains.<span class="rmn">1020</span><br>

<p>
<span class="indented">He turn'd–there was a whelming sound–he stept,</span><br>
There was a cooler light; and so he kept<br>
Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!<br>
More suddenly than doth a moment go,<br>
The visions of the earth were gone and fled–<br>
He saw the giant sea above his head.<br>

There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men<br>
With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen<br>
Their baaing vanities, to browse away<br>
The comfortable green and juicy hay<br>
From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!<br>
Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd<br>
Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe<br>
Our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge<br>
Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight<br>
Able to face an owl's, they still are dight<span class="rmn">10</span><br>
<!-- Page 112 -->
By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,<br>
And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,<br>
Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount<br>
To their spirit's perch, their being's high account,<br>
Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones–<br>
Amid the fierce intoxicating tones<br>
Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,<br>
And sudden cannon. All! how all this hums,<br>
In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone–<br>
Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,<span class="rmn">20</span><br>
And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.–<br>
Are then regalities all gilded masks?<br>
No, there are throned seats unscalable<br>
But by a patient wing, a constant spell,<br>
Or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,<br>
Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,<br>
And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents<br>
To watch the abysm-birth of elements.<br>
Aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate<br>
A thousand Powers keep religious state,<span class="rmn">30</span><br>
In water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;<br>
And, silent as a consecrated urn,<br>

Hold sphery sessions for a season due.<br>
Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!<br>
Have bared their operations to this globe–<br>
Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe<br>
Our piece of heaven–whose benevolence<br>
Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense<br>
Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,<br>
As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud<span class="rmn">40</span><br>
'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,<br>
Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair<br>
Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.<br>
When thy gold breath is misting in the west,<br>
She unobserved steals unto her throne,<br>
And there she sits most meek and most alone;<br>
As if she had not pomp subservient;<br>
As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent<br>
Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;<br>
As if the ministring stars kept not apart,<span class="rmn">50</span><br>
Waiting for silver-footed messages.<br>
O Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees<br>

O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din<br>

The while they feel thine airy fellowship.<br>
Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip<br>
Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,<br>
Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:<br>
Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,<br>
Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;<span class="rmn">60</span><br>
And yet thy benediction passeth not<br>
One obscure hiding-place, one little spot<br>
Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren<br>
Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,<br>
And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf<br>
Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief<br>
To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps<br>
Within its pearly house.–The mighty deeps,<br>
The monstrous sea is thine–the myriad sea!<br>

For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale<br>
For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail<br>
His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?<br>
Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,<br>
Or what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!<br>
How chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!<span class="rmn">80</span><br>

Dancing upon the waves, as if to please<br>
The curly foam with amorous influence.<br>
O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence<br>

O'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out<br>
The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning<br>
Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.<span class="rmn">90</span><br>

With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,<br>
Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light<br>
Against his pallid face: he felt the charm<br>
To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm<br>
Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd<br>
His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid<br>
His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,<span class="rmn">110</span><br>
To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,<br>
Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.<br>
And so he kept, until the rosy veils<br>
Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand<br>
Were lifted from the water's breast, and faun'd<br>
Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came<br>

With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd<br>
Above, around, and at his feet; save things<br>
More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:<br>
Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large<br>
Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;<br>
Rudders that for a hundred years had lost<br>
The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd<br>
With long-forgotten story, and wherein<br>
No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin<span class="rmn">130</span><br>
But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,<br>
Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls<br>
Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude<br>
In ponderous stone, developing the mood<br>
Of ancient Nox;–then skeletons of man,<br>
Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,<br>
And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw<br>
Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe<br>

These secrets struck into him; and unless<br>
Dian had chaced away that heaviness,<span class="rmn">140</span><br>
He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,<br>

From eve to morn across the firmament.<br>
No apples would I gather from the tree,<br>

No melody was like a passing spright<span class="rmn">160</span><br>
If it went not to solemnize thy reign.<br>
Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain<br>
By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;<br>
And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend<br>
With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;<br>
Thou wast the mountain-top–the sage's pen–<br>
The poet's harp–the voice of friends–the sun;<br>
Thou wast the river–thou wast glory won;<br>
Thou wast my clarion's blast–thou wast my steed–<br>

Myself to immortality: I prest<br>
Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.<br>
But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss–<br>
My strange love came–Felicity's abyss!<br>
She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away–<br>
Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway<span class="rmn">180</span><br>
<!-- Page 120 -->
Has been an under-passion to this hour.<br>
Now I begin to feel thine orby power<br>
Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,<br>
Keep back thine influence, and do not blind<br>
My sovereign vision.–Dearest love, forgive<br>
That I can think away from thee and live!–<br>
Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize<br>
One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!<br>
How far beyond!" At this a surpris'd start<br>
Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;<span class="rmn">190</span><br>
For as he lifted up his eyes to swear<br>
How his own goddess was past all things fair,<br>
He saw far in the concave green of the sea<br>
An old man sitting calm and peacefully.<br>
Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,<br>
And his white hair was awful, and a mat<br>
Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;<br>
And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,<br>
A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,<br>
O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans<span class="rmn">200</span><br>
Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form<br>
Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,<br>
<!-- Page 121 -->
And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar<br>
Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape<br>
That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.<br>
The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,<br>
Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell<br>
To its huge self; and the minutest fish<br>
Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,<br>
And shew his little eye's anatomy.<span class="rmn">210</span><br>
Then there was pictur'd the regality<br>
Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,<br>
In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.<br>
Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,<br>
And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd<br>
So stedfastly, that the new denizen<br>
Had time to keep him in amazed ken,<br>
To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw</span><br>
The wilder'd stranger–seeming not to see,<span class="rmn">220</span><br>
His features were so lifeless. Suddenly<br>
He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows<br>
Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs<br>
<!-- Page 122 -->
Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,<br>
Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,<br>
Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.<br>
Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil<br>
Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,<br>
Who had not from mid-life to utmost age<br>
Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,<span class="rmn">230</span><br>
Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,<br>
With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,<br>
And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd<br>
Echo into oblivion, he said:–<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head</span><br>
In peace upon my watery pillow: now<br>
Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.<br>
O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!<br>
O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung<br>
With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,<span class="rmn">240</span><br>
When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?–<br>
I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen<br>
Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;<br>
<!-- Page 123 -->
Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,<br>
That writhes about the roots of Sicily:<br>
To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,<br>
And mount upon the snortings of a whale<br>
To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep<br>
On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,<br>
Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd<span class="rmn">250</span><br>
With rapture to the other side of the world!<br>
O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,<br>
I bow full hearted to your old decree!<br>
Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,<br>
For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.<br>
Thou art the man!" Endymion started back<br>
Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack<br>
Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,<br>
Mutter'd: "What lonely death am I to die<br>
In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,<span class="rmn">260</span><br>
And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?<br>
Or will he touch me with his searing hand,<br>
And leave a black memorial on the sand?<br>
Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,<br>
And keep me as a chosen food to draw<br>
<!-- Page 124 -->
His magian fish through hated fire and flame?<br>
O misery of hell! resistless, tame,<br>
Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,<br>
Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!–<br>
O Tartarus! but some few days agone<span class="rmn">270</span><br>
Her soft arms were entwining me, and on<br>
Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:<br>
Her lips were all my own, and–ah, ripe sheaves<br>
Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,<br>
But never may be garner'd. I must stoop<br>
My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!<br>
Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell<br>
Would melt at thy sweet breath.–By Dian's hind<br>
Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind<br>
I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,<span class="rmn">280</span><br>
I care not for this old mysterious man!"<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">He spake, and walking to that aged form,</span><br>
Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm<br>
With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.<br>
Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?<br>
<!-- Page 125 -->
Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought<br>
Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,<br>
Convulsion to a mouth of many years?<br>
He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.<br>
The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt<span class="rmn">290</span><br>
Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt<br>
About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Arise, good youth, for sacred Phœbus' sake!</span><br>
I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel<br>
A very brother's yearning for thee steal<br>
Into mine own: for why? thou openest<br>
The prison gates that have so long opprest<br>
My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,<br>
Thou art commission'd to this fated spot<br>
For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;<span class="rmn">300</span><br>
I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:<br>
Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power,<br>
I had been grieving at this joyous hour.<br>
But even now most miserable old,<br>
I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold<br>
<!-- Page 126 -->
Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case<br>
Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays<br>
As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,<br>
For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,<br>
Now as we speed towards our joyous task."<span class="rmn">310</span><br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">So saying, this young soul in age's mask</span><br>
Went forward with the Carian side by side:<br>
Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide<br>
Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands<br>

Now past the midway from mortality,<br>
And so I can prepare without a sigh<br>
To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.<br>
I was a fisher once, upon this main,<span class="rmn">320</span><br>
And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;<br>
Rough billows were my home by night and day,–<br>
The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had<br>
No housing from the storm and tempests mad,<br>
<!-- Page 127 -->
But hollow rocks,–and they were palaces<br>
Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:<br>
Long years of misery have told me so.<br>
Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.<br>
One thousand years!–Is it then possible<br>
To look so plainly through them? to dispel<span class="rmn">330</span><br>
A thousand years with backward glance sublime?<br>
To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime<br>
From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,<br>
And one's own image from the bottom peep?<br>
Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,<br>
My long captivity and moanings all<br>
Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,<br>
The which I breathe away, and thronging come<br>
Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:</span><br>
I was a lonely youth on desert shores.<span class="rmn">341</span><br>
My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,<br>
And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry<br>
Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.<br>
<!-- Page 128 -->
Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen<br>
Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,<br>
Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,<br>
When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft<br>
Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe<br>
To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe<span class="rmn">350</span><br>
My life away like a vast sponge of fate,<br>
Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,<br>
Has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,<br>
And left me tossing safely. But the crown<br>
Of all my life was utmost quietude:<br>
More did I love to lie in cavern rude,<br>
Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,<br>
And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!<br>
There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer<br>
My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear<span class="rmn">360</span><br>
The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,<br>
Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:<br>
And never was a day of summer shine,<br>
But I beheld its birth upon the brine:<br>
For I would watch all night to see unfold<br>
Heaven's gates, and Æthon snort his morning gold<br>
<!-- Page 129 -->
Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly<br>
At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,<br>
My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.<br>
The poor folk of the sea-country I blest<span class="rmn">370</span><br>
With daily boon of fish most delicate:<br>
They knew not whence this bounty, and elate<br>
Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach</span><br>
At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!<br>
Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began<br>
To feel distemper'd longings: to desire<br>
The utmost privilege that ocean's sire<br>
Could grant in benediction: to be free<br>
Of all his kingdom. Long in misery<span class="rmn">380</span><br>
I wasted, ere in one extremest fit<br>
I plung'd for life or death. To interknit<br>
One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff<br>
Might seem a work of pain; so not enough<br>
Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,<br>
And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt<br>
<!-- Page 130 -->
Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;<br>
Forgetful utterly of self-intent;<br>
Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.<br>
Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew<span class="rmn">390</span><br>
His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,<br>
I tried in fear the pinions of my will.<br>
'Twas freedom! and at once I visited<br>
The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.<br>
No need to tell thee of them, for I see<br>
That thou hast been a witness–it must be–<br>
For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,<br>
By the melancholy corners of that mouth.<br>
So I will in my story straightway pass<br>
To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!<span class="rmn">400</span><br>
That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!<br>
Why did poor Glaucus ever–ever dare<br>
To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!<br>
I lov'd her to the very white of truth,<br>
And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!<br>
She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,<br>
Round every isle, and point, and promontory,<br>
From where large Hercules wound up his story<br>
<!-- Page 131 -->
Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew<br>
The more, the more I saw her dainty hue<span class="rmn">410</span><br>
Gleam delicately through the azure clear:<br>
Until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;<br>
And in that agony, across my grief<br>
It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief–<br>
Cruel enchantress! So above the water<br>
I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phœbus' daughter.<br>
Ææa's isle was wondering at the moon:–<br>
It seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon<br>
Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;</span><span class="rmn">420</span><br>
Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,<br>
Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.<br>
How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,<br>
And over it a sighing voice expire.<br>
It ceased–I caught light footsteps; and anon<br>
The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon<br>
Push'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!<br>
With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove<br>
<!-- Page 132 -->
A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all<br>
The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall<span class="rmn">430</span><br>
The dew of her rich speech: "Ah! Art awake?<br>
O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!<br>
I am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed<br>
An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;<br>
And now I find thee living, I will pour<br>
From these devoted eyes their silver store,<br>
Until exhausted of the latest drop,<br>
So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop<br>
Here, that I too may live: but if beyond<br>
Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond<span class="rmn">440</span><br>
Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;<br>
If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;<br>
If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,<br>
Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,<br>
O let me pluck it for thee." Thus she link'd<br>
Her charming syllables, till indistinct<br>
Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;<br>
And then she hover'd over me, and stole<br>
So near, that if no nearer it had been<br>
This furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.<span class="rmn">450</span><br>
<!-- Page 133 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Young man of Latmos! thus particular</span><br>
Am I, that thou may'st plainly see how far<br>
This fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not<br>
Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"Who could resist? Who in this universe?</span><br>
She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse<br>
My fine existence in a golden clime.<br>
She took me like a child of suckling time,<br>
And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,<br>
The current of my former life was stemm'd,<span class="rmn">460</span><br>
And to this arbitrary queen of sense<br>
I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence<br>
Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd<br>
Me back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.<br>
For as Apollo each eve doth devise<br>
A new appareling for western skies;<br>
So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour<br>
Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.<br>
And I was free of haunts umbrageous;<br>
Could wander in the mazy forest-house<span class="rmn">470</span><br>
<!-- Page 134 -->
Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,<br>
And birds from coverts innermost and drear<br>
Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow–<br>

As Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn<br>

How specious heaven was changed to real hell.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"One morn she left me sleeping: half awake</span><span class="rmn">480</span><br>
I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake<br>
My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;<br>
But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts<br>
Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,<br>
That out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.<br>
Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom<br>
Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom<br>
A sound of moan, an agony of sound,<br>
Sepulchral from the distance all around.<br>
<!-- Page 135 -->
Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled<span class="rmn">490</span><br>
That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled<br>
Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd.<br>
I came to a dark valley.–Groanings swell'd<br>
Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,<br>
The nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,<br>
That glar'd before me through a thorny brake.<br>
This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,<br>
Bewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near<br>
A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:<br>
In thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene–<span class="rmn">500</span><br>
The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,<br>
Seated upon an uptorn forest root;<br>
And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,<br>
Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,<br>
Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!<br>
O such deformities! Old Charon's self,<br>
Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,<br>
And take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,<br>
It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,<br>
And tyrannizing was the lady's look,<span class="rmn">510</span><br>
As over them a gnarled staff she shook.<br>
<!-- Page 136 -->
Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,<br>
And from a basket emptied to the rout<br>
Clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick<br>
And roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick<br>
About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,<br>
Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,<br>
And emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:<br>
Groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial<br>
Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.<span class="rmn">520</span><br>
She lifted up the charm: appealing groans<br>
From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear<br>
In vain; remorseless as an infant's bier<br>
She whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.<br>
Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,<br>
Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,<br>
Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;<br>
Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat<br>
And puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:<br>
Then was appalling silence: then a sight<span class="rmn">530</span><br>
More wildering than all that hoarse affright;<br>
For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,<br>
Went through the dismal air like one huge Python<br>
<!-- Page 137 -->
Antagonizing Boreas,–and so vanish'd.<br>
Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd<br>
These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark<br>
Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,<br>
With dancing and loud revelry,–and went<br>
Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.–<br>
Sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd<span class="rmn">540</span><br>
Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud<br>
In human accent: "Potent goddess! chief<br>
Of pains resistless! make my being brief,<br>
Or let me from this heavy prison fly:<br>
Or give me to the air, or let me die!<br>
I sue not for my happy crown again;<br>
I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;<br>
I sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;<br>
I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,<br>
My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!<span class="rmn">550</span><br>
I will forget them; I will pass these joys;<br>
Ask nought so heavenward, so too–too high:<br>
Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,<br>
Or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,<br>
From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,<br>

And merely given to the cold bleak air.<br>
Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"<br>

Naked and sabre-like against my heart.<span class="rmn">560</span><br>
I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;<br>
And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,<br>
Fainted away in that dark lair of night.<br>
Think, my deliverer, how desolate<br>
My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,<br>
And terrors manifold divided me<br>
A spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee<br>
Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:<br>
I fled three days–when lo! before me stood<br>
Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,<span class="rmn">570</span><br>
A clammy dew is beading on my brow,<br>
At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.<br>
"Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse<br>
Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,<br>
To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,<br>
I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:<br>
<!-- Page 139 -->
My tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.<br>
So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies<br>
Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries<br>
Upon some breast more lily-feminine.<span class="rmn">580</span><br>
Oh, no–it shall not pine, and pine, and pine<br>
More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;<br>
And then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears<br>
Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!<br>
Young dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt<br>
One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,<br>
That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.<br>
And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.<br>
Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,<br>
Let me sob over thee my last adieus,<span class="rmn">590</span><br>
And speak a blessing: Mark me! Thou hast thews<br>
Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:<br>
But such a love is mine, that here I chase<br>
Eternally away from thee all bloom<br>
Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.<br>
Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;<br>
And there, ere many days be overpast,<br>
Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then<br>
<!-- Page 140 -->
Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;<br>
But live and wither, cripple and still breathe<span class="rmn">600</span><br>
Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath<br>
Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.<br>
Adieu, sweet love, adieu!"–As shot stars fall,<br>
She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung<br>
And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung<br>
A war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.<br>
A hand was at my shoulder to compel<br>
My sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes<br>
Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise<br>
Enforced, at the last by ocean's foam<span class="rmn">610</span><br>
I found me; by my fresh, my native home.<br>
Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,<br>
Came salutary as I waded in;<br>
And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave<br>
Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave<br>
Large froth before me, while there yet remain'd<br>
Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.<br>

Until there shone a fabric crystalline,<br>
Ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.<br>
Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl<br>
Gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!<br>
'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;<br>
And all around–But wherefore this to thee<br>
Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?–<br>
I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.<br>
My fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread<br>

In perilous bustle; while upon the deck<br>
Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;<br>
<!-- Page 143 -->
The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:<br>
I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.<br>
O they had all been sav'd but crazed eld<br>
Annull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd<br>
And curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit<br>
Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit<br>
Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,<br>
By one and one, to pale oblivion;<span class="rmn">670</span><br>
And I was gazing on the surges prone,<br>
With many a scalding tear and many a groan,<br>
When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,<br>
Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.<br>
I knelt with pain–reached out my hand–had grasp'd<br>
These treasures–touch'd the knuckles–they unclasp'd–<br>
I caught a finger: but the downward weight<br>
O'erpowered me–it sank. Then 'gan abate<br>
The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst<br>
The comfortable sun. I was athirst<span class="rmn">680</span><br>
To search the book, and in the warming air<br>
Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.<br>
Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on<br>
My soul page after page, till well-nigh won<br>
<!-- Page 144 -->
Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,<br>
I read these words, and read again, and tried<br>
My eyes against the heavens, and read again.<br>
O what a load of misery and pain<br>
Each Atlas-line bore off!–a shine of hope<br>
Came gold around me, cheering me to cope<span class="rmn">690</span><br>
Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!<br>
For thou hast brought their promise to an end.<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">"<i>In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,</i></span><br>
<i>Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch<br>
His loath'd existence through ten centuries,<br>
And then to die alone. Who can devise<br>
A total opposition? No one. So<br>
One million times ocean must ebb and flow,<br>
And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,<br>
These things accomplish'd:–If he utterly</i><span class="rmn">700</span><br>
<i>Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds<br>

If he explores all forms and substances<br>

<!-- Page 145 -->
<i>He must pursue this task of joy and grief<br>

"We are twin brothers in this destiny!<br>
Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high<br>
Is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.<br>
What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,<span class="rmn">720</span><br>
Had we both perish'd?"–"Look!" the sage replied,<br>
"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,<br>
Of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice<br>
I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;<br>
And where I have enshrined piously<br>
All lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die<br>

Throughout my bondage." Thus discoursing, on<br>
They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;<br>
Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.<br>
Sure never since king Neptune held his state<span class="rmn">730</span><br>
Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.<br>
Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars<br>
Has legion'd all his battle; and behold<br>
How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold<br>
His even breast: see, many steeled squares,<br>
And rigid ranks of iron–whence who dares<br>
One step? Imagine further, line by line,<br>
These warrior thousands on the field supine:–<br>
So in that crystal place, in silent rows,<br>
Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.–<span class="rmn">740</span><br>
The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd<br>
Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;<br>
Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips<br>
All ruddy,–for here death no blossom nips.<br>
He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair<br>
Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;<br>

He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,<br>
Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,<br>
Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.<br>
He tore it into pieces small as snow<br>
That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;<br>
And having done it, took his dark blue cloak<br>
And bound it round Endymion: then struck<br>
His wand against the empty air times nine.–<br>
"What more there is to do, young man, is thine:<br>
But first a little patience; first undo<span class="rmn">760</span><br>
This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.<br>
Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;<br>
And shouldst thou break it–What, is it done so clean?<br>
A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!<br>
The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.<br>
Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,<br>
Nor mark'd with any sign or charactery–<br>

Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd<br>
A lullaby to silence.–"Youth! now strew<br>
These minced leaves on me, and passing through<br>
Those files of dead, scatter the same around,<br>
And thou wilt see the issue."–'Mid the sound<br>
Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,<br>
Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,<br>
And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.<br>
How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight<span class="rmn">780</span><br>
Smiling beneath a coral diadem,<br>
Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,<br>
Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,<br>
Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force<br>
Press'd its cold hand, and wept,–and Scylla sigh'd!<br>
Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied–<br>
The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,<br>

Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.<br>

Death felt it to his inwards: 'twas too much:<br>

Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.<br>
The Latmian persever'd along, and thus<br>
All were re-animated. There arose<br>
A noise of harmony, pulses and throes<br>
Of gladness in the air–while many, who<br>
Had died in mutual arms devout and true,<br>
Sprang to each other madly; and the rest<br>
Felt a high certainty of being blest.<span class="rmn">800</span><br>

Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.<br>
Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,<br>
Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers<br>
Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.<br>
The two deliverers tasted a pure wine<br>
Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.<br>
Speechless they eyed each other, and about<br>

Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,<br>
They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,<br>
Though portal columns of a giant size,<br>
Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.<br>
Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,<br>
Down marble steps; pouring as easily<span class="rmn">820</span><br>

Swallows obeying the south summer's call,<br>

</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,</span><br>
Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,<br>
Just within ken, they saw descending thick<br>
Another multitude. Whereat more quick<br>
Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,<br>
And of those numbers every eye was wet;<br>
For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,<span class="rmn">830</span><br>
Like what was never heard in all the throes<br>
Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit<br>
To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.<br>

<p>
<span class="indented">This mighty consummation made, the host</span><br>
Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost<br>
Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,<br>
And from the rear diminishing away,–<br>
Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,<br>
"Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!<br>
God Neptune's palaces!" With noise increas'd,<span class="rmn">840</span><br>
They shoulder'd on towards that brightening cast.<br>
At every onward step proud domes arose<br>
In prospect,–diamond gleams, and golden glows<br>
Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.<br>
Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,<br>
Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.<br>
Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld<br>
By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts<br>
A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts<br>
Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:<span class="rmn">850</span><br>
For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere<br>
As marble was there lavish, to the vast<br>
Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,<br>
Even for common bulk, those olden three,<br>
Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.<br>

Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,<br>
To which the leaders sped; but not half raught<br>
Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,<br>
And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes<br>
Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.<br>
Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze<br>
Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,<br>
And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne<br>
Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;<br>
At his right hand stood winged Love, and on<span class="rmn">870</span><br>

<p>
<span class="indented">Far as the mariner on highest mast</span><br>

Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering<span class="rmn">880</span><br>

From natural west, and east, and south, and north,<br>
A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth<br>

Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread<br>

Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed<br>
On all the multitude a nectarous dew.<br>
The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew<span class="rmn">900</span><br>
Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;<br>
And when they reach'd the throned eminence<br>
She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,–who sat her down<br>
A toying with the doves. Then,–"Mighty crown<br>

Behold!"–Two copious tear-drops instant fell<br>

I met thee in earth's bosom, all my power<br>

Escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?<br>
A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,<br>

<p>
Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!<br>
O first-born on the mountains! by the hues<br>
Of heaven on the spiritual air begot:<br>
Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,<br>
While yet our England was a wolfish den;<br>
Before our forests heard the talk of men;<br>
Before the first of Druids was a child;–<br>
Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild<br>
Rapt in a deep prophetic solitude.<br>
There came an eastern voice of solemn mood:–<span class="rmn">10</span><br>

Yet wast thou patient. Then sang forth the Nine,<br>
Apollo's garland:–yet didst thou divine<br>
Such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,<br>
"Come hither, Sister of the Island!" Plain<br>
Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake<br>
A higher summons:–still didst thou betake<br>
Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won<br>
A full accomplishment! The thing is done,<br>
Which undone, these our latter days had risen<br>
On barren souls. Great Muse, thou know'st what prison,<br>
Of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets<span class="rmn">21</span><br>
Our spirit's wings: despondency besets<br>
Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn<br>
Seems to give forth its light in very scorn<br>
Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.<br>
Long have I said, how happy he who shrives<br>
To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,<br>
And could not pray:–nor can I now–so on<br>
I move to the end in lowliness of heart.–<br>

Call me his queen, his second life's fair crown!<br>
Ah me, how I could love!–My soul doth melt<br>
<!-- Page 168 -->
For the unhappy youth–Love! I have felt<br>
So faint a kindness, such a meek surrender<br>
To what my own full thoughts had made too tender,<br>
That but for tears my life had fled away!–<br>
Ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,<br>
And thou, old forest, hold ye this for true,<br>
There is no lightning, no authentic dew<br>
But in the eye of love: there's not a sound,<span class="rmn">80</span><br>
Melodious howsoever, can confound<br>
The heavens and earth in one to such a death<br>
As doth the voice of love: there's not a breath<br>
Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,<br>
Till it has panted round, and stolen a share<br>

He leant, wretched. He surely cannot now<br>
Thirst for another love: O impious,<br>
That he can even dream upon it thus!–<span class="rmn">90</span><br>
Thought he, "Why am I not as are the dead,<br>
Since to a woe like this I have been led<br>
Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?<br>
<!-- Page 169 -->
Goddess! I love thee not the less: from thee<br>
By Juno's smile I turn not–no, no, no–<br>
While the great waters are at ebb and flow.–<br>
I have a triple soul! O fond pretence–<br>
For both, for both my love is so immense,<br>
I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.</span><span class="rmn">100</span><br>
The lady's heart beat quick, and he could see<br>
Her gentle bosom heave tumultuously.<br>
He sprang from his green covert: there she lay,<br>
Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;<br>
With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes<br>
Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.<br>
"Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I<br>
Thus violate thy bower's sanctity!<br>
O pardon me, for I am full of grief–<br>
Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!<span class="rmn">110</span><br>
Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith<br>
I was to top the heavens. Dear maid, sith<br>
Thou art my executioner, and I feel<br>
Loving and hatred, misery and weal,<br>
<!-- Page 170 -->
Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,<br>
And all my story that much passion slew me;<br>
Do smile upon the evening of my days:<br>
And, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,<br>
Be thou my nurse; and let me understand<br>
How dying I shall kiss that lily hand.–<span class="rmn">120</span><br>
Dost weep for me? Then should I be content.<br>
Scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament<br>
Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth<br>
Crumbles into itself. By the cloud girth<br>
Of Jove, those tears have given me a thirst<br>
To meet oblivion."–As her heart would burst<br>
The maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied:<br>
"Why must such desolation betide<br>
As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks<br>
Empty of all misfortune? Do the brooks<span class="rmn">130</span><br>
Utter a gorgon voice? Does yonder thrush,<br>
Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush<br>
About the dewy forest, whisper tales?–<br>
Speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails<br>
Will slime the rose to night. Though if thou wilt,<br>
Methinks 'twould be a guilt–a very guilt–<br>
<!-- Page 171 -->
Not to companion thee, and sigh away<br>
The light–the dusk–the dark–till break of day!"<br>
"Dear lady," said Endymion, "'tis past:<br>
I love thee! and my days can never last.<span class="rmn">140</span><br>
That I may pass in patience still speak:<br>
Let me have music dying, and I seek<br>
No more delight–I bid adieu to all.<br>
Didst thou not after other climates call,<br>
And murmur about Indian streams?"–Then she,<br>
Sitting beneath the midmost forest tree,<br>
For pity sang this roundelay—<br>

"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,<br>

There came a noise of revellers: the rills<br>
Into the wide stream came of purple hue–<br>

The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills<br>
From kissing cymbals made a merry din–<span class="rmn">200</span><br>

"Within his car, aloft, young Bacchus stood,<br>
Trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,<br>
<span class="indented3">With sidelong laughing;</span><br>
And little rills of crimson wine imbrued<br>
His plump white arms, and shoulders, enough white<br>

Onward these myriads–with song and dance,<br>
With zebras striped, and sleek Arabians' prance,<br>
Web-footed alligators, crocodiles,<br>

Plump infant laughers mimicking the coil<br>

<!-- Page 179 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">O what a sigh she gave in finishing,</span><br>
And look, quite dead to every worldly thing!<br>
Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;<br>
And listened to the wind that now did stir<br>
About the crisped oaks full drearily,<br>
Yet with as sweet a softness as might be<br>
Remember'd from its velvet summer song.<br>
At last he said: "Poor lady, how thus long<span class="rmn">300</span><br>
Have I been able to endure that voice?<br>
Fair Melody! kind Syren! I've no choice;<br>
I must be thy sad servant evermore:<br>
I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.<br>
Alas, I must not think–by Phœbe, no!<br>
Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?<br>
Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?<br>
O thou could'st foster me beyond the brink<br>
Of recollection! make my watchful care<br>
Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!<span class="rmn">310</span><br>
Do gently murder half my soul, and I<br>
Shall feel the other half so utterly!–<br>
I'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;<br>
O let it blush so ever! let it soothe<br>
<!-- Page 180 -->
My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm<br>
With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.–<br>
This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;<br>
And this is sure thine other softling–this<br>
Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!<br>
Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!<span class="rmn">320</span><br>
And whisper one sweet word that I may know<br>
This is this world–sweet dewy blossom!"–<i>Woe!<br>
Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?</i>–<br>
Even these words went echoing dismally<br>
Through the wide forest–a most fearful tone,<br>
Like one repenting in his latest moan;<br>
And while it died away a shade pass'd by,<br>
As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly<br>
Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth<br>
Their timid necks and tremble; so these both<span class="rmn">330</span><br>
Leant to each other trembling, and sat so<br>
Waiting for some destruction–when lo,<br>
Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime<br>
Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time<br>
Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt<br>
Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt<br>
<!-- Page 181 -->
One moment from his home: only the sward<br>
He with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward<br>
Swifter than sight was gone–even before<br>
The teeming earth a sudden witness bore<span class="rmn">340</span><br>
Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear<br>
Above the crystal circlings white and clear;<br>
And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,<br>
How they can dive in sight and unseen rise–<br>
So from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,<br>
Each with large dark blue wings upon his back.<br>
The youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame<br>
On one, and felt himself in spleen to tame<br>
The other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,<br>
High as the eagles. Like two drops of dew<span class="rmn">350</span><br>
Exhal'd to Phœbus' lips, away they are gone,<br>
Far from the earth away–unseen, alone,<br>
Among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,<br>
The buoyant life of song can floating be<br>
Above their heads, and follow them untir'd.–<br>
Muse of my native land, am I inspir'd?<br>
This is the giddy air, and I must spread<br>
Wide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread<br>
<!-- Page 182 -->
Or height, or depth, or width, or any chance<br>
Precipitous: I have beneath my glance<span class="rmn">360</span><br>
Those towering horses and their mournful freight.<br>
Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await<br>
Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?–<br>
There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade<br>
From some approaching wonder, and behold<br>
Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold<br>
Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,<br>
Dying to embers from their native fire!<br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,</span><br>
It seem'd as when around the pale new moon<span class="rmn">370</span><br>
Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:<br>
'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.<br>
For the first time, since he came nigh dead born<br>
From the old womb of night, his cave forlorn<br>
Had he left more forlorn; for the first time,<br>
He felt aloof the day and morning's prime–<br>
Because into his depth Cimmerian<br>
There came a dream, shewing how a young man,<br>
<!-- Page 183 -->
Ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,<br>
Would at high Jove's empyreal footstool win<span class="rmn">380</span><br>
An immortality, and how espouse<br>
Jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.<br>
Now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,<br>
That he might at the threshold one hour wait<br>
To hear the marriage melodies, and then<br>
Sink downward to his dusky cave again.<br>
His litter of smooth semilucent mist,<br>
Diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,<br>
Puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;<br>
And scarcely for one moment could be caught<span class="rmn">390</span><br>
His sluggish form reposing motionless.<br>
Those two on winged steeds, with all the stress<br>
Of vision search'd for him, as one would look<br>
Athwart the sallows of a river nook<br>
To catch a glance at silver throated eels,–<br>
Or from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals<br>
His rugged forehead in a mantle pale,<br>
With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale<br>
Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.<br>
<!-- Page 184 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">These raven horses, though they foster'd are</span><span class="rmn">400</span><br>
Of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop<br>
Their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;<br>
Upon the spiritless mist have they outspread<br>
Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,–<br>
And on those pinions, level in mid air,<br>
Endymion sleepeth and the lady fair.<br>
Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle<br>
Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile<br>
The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks<br>
On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks<span class="rmn">410</span><br>
To divine powers: from his hand full fain<br>
Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:<br>
He tries the nerve of Phœbus' golden bow,<br>
And asketh where the golden apples grow:<br>
Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,<br>
And strives in vain to unsettle and wield<br>
A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings<br>
A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings<br>
And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,<br>
And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,<span class="rmn">420</span><br>
<!-- Page 185 -->
Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.<br>
He blows a bugle,–an ethereal band<br>
Are visible above: the Seasons four,–<br>
Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store<br>
In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,<br>
Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,<br>
In swells unmitigated, still doth last<br>
To sway their floating morris. "Whose is this?<br>
Whose bugle?" he inquires: they smile–"O Dis!<br>
Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know<span class="rmn">430</span><br>
Its mistress' lips? Not thou?–'Tis Dian's: lo!<br>
She rises crescented!" He looks, 'tis she,<br>
His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,<br>
And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;<br>
Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring<br>
Towards her, and awakes–and, strange, o'erhead,<br>
Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,<br>
Beheld awake his very dream: the gods<br>
Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;<br>
And Phœbe bends towards him crescented.<span class="rmn">440</span><br>
O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,<br>
<!-- Page 186 -->
Too well awake, he feels the panting side<br>
Of his delicious lady. He who died<br>
For soaring too audacious in the sun,<br>
Where that same treacherous wax began to run,<br>
Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.<br>
His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,<br>
To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way–<br>
Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!<br>
So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,<span class="rmn">450</span><br>
He could not help but kiss her: then he grew<br>
Awhile forgetful of all beauty save<br>
Young Phœbe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave<br>
Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look<br>
At the sweet sleeper,–all his soul was shook,–<br>
She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more<br>
He could not help but kiss her and adore.<br>
At this the shadow wept, melting away.<br>
The Latmian started up: "Bright goddess, stay!<br>
Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,<br>
I have no dædale heart: why is it wrung<span class="rmn">461</span><br>
To desperation? Is there nought for me,<br>
Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"<br>
<!-- Page 187 -->
</p>
<p>
<span class="indented">These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:</span><br>
Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses<br>
With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.<br>
"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe<br>
This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st<br>
Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st<br>
What horrors may discomfort thee and me.<span class="rmn">470</span><br>
Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!–<br>
Yet did she merely weep–her gentle soul<br>
Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole<br>
In tenderness, would I were whole in love!<br>
Can I prize thee, fair maid, till price above,<br>
Even when I feel as true as innocence?<br>
I do, I do.–What is this soul then? Whence<br>
Came it? It does not seem my own, and I<br>
Have no self-passion or identity.<br>
Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?<span class="rmn">480</span><br>
By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit<br>
Alone about the dark–Forgive me, sweet:<br>
Shall we away?" He rous'd the steeds: they beat<br>
Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,<br>
Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.<br>
<!-- Page 188 -->

<p>
<span class="indented">The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,</span><br>
And Vesper, risen star, began to throe<br>
In the dusk heavens silvery, when they<br>
Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.<br>
Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange–<span class="rmn">490</span><br>
Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,<br>
In such wise, in such temper, so aloof<br>
Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,<br>
So witless of their doom, that verily<br>
'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;<br>
Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd–<br>
Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.<br>

<p>
<span class="indented">Fell facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,</span><br>
The moon put forth a little diamond peak,<br>
No bigger than an unobserved star,<span class="rmn">500</span><br>
Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;<br>
Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie<br>
Her silver sandals, ere deliciously<br>
She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.<br>
Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,<br>
While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,<br>
<!-- Page 189 -->
To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd<br>
This beauty in its birth–Despair! despair!<br>
He saw her body fading gaunt and spare<br>
In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;<br>
It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,<span class="rmn">511</span><br>
And, horror! kiss'd his own–he was alone.<br>

Beyond the seeming confines of the space<br>
Made for the soul to wander in and trace<br>
Its own existence, of remotest glooms.<br>
Dark regions are around it, where the tombs<br>
Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce<span class="rmn">520</span><br>

Of every ill: the man is yet to come<br>
Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.<br>
But few have ever felt how calm and well<br>
<!-- Page 190 -->
Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.<br>
There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:<br>
Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,<span class="rmn">530</span><br>
Yet all is still within and desolate.<br>
Beset with plainful gusts, within ye hear<br>
No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier<br>
The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none<br>
Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.<br>
Just when the sufferer begins to burn,<br>
Then it is free to him; and from an urn,<br>
Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught–<br>
Young Semele such richness never quaft<br>
In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!<span class="rmn">540</span><br>
Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom<br>
Of health by due; where silence dreariest<br>
Is most articulate; where hopes infest;<br>
Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep<br>
Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.<br>
O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!<br>
Pregnant with such a den to save the whole<br>
In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!<br>
For, never since thy griefs and woes began,<br>
<!-- Page 191 -->
Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud<span class="rmn">550</span><br>
Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.<br>
Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne<br>
With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn<br>
Because he knew not whither he was going.<br>
So happy was he, not the aerial blowing<br>
Of trumpets at clear parley from the east<br>
Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.<br>
They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm<br>
He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm<br>
Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd<span class="rmn">560</span><br>
A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,–<br>
And silvery was its passing: voices sweet<br>
Warbling the while as if to lull and greet<br>
The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,<br>
While past the vision went in bright array.<br>

Let us ay love each other; let us fare<span class="rmn">630</span><br>

Adieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast<span class="rmn">660</span><br>
My love is still for thee. The hour may come<br>
When we shall meet in pure elysium.<br>
On earth I may not love thee; and therefore<br>
Doves will I offer up, and sweetest store<br>
All through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine<br>
On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,<br>
And bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!<br>
My river-lily bud! one human kiss!<br>
One sigh of real breath–one gentle squeeze,<br>

Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that!–all good<br>
We'll talk about–no more of dreaming.–Now,<br>
Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow<br>
Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun<br>
Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;<br>
And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,<br>
Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?<br>

O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;<br>
Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace<span class="rmn">680</span><br>
Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:<br>
For by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,<br>
And by another, in deep dell below,<br>
See, through the trees, a little river go<br>
All in its mid-day gold and glimmering.<br>
Honey from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,<br>
And apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,–<br>
Cresses that grow where no man may them see,<br>
And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:<br>
Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,<span class="rmn">690</span><br>
That thou mayst always know whither I roam,<br>
When it shall please thee in our quiet home<br>
To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;<br>
Still let me dive into the joy I seek,–<br>
For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,<br>
Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill<br>
With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,<br>
And thou shall feed them from the squirrel's barn.<br>
Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,<br>
And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.<span class="rmn">700</span><br>

Its sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,<br>
And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.<br>
I will entice this crystal rill to trace<br>
Love's silver name upon the meadow's face.<br>
I'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;<br>
And to god Phœbus, for a golden lyre;<br>
To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;<br>
To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,<br>
That I may see thy beauty through the night;<br>
To Flora, and a nightingale shall light<span class="rmn">710</span><br>
Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,<br>

Of gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.<br>
Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!<br>
Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be<br>
'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:<br>
Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak<br>
Laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,<br>
Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,<br>

Wilt thou devote this body to the earth:<br>

With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.<span class="rmn">740</span><br>
Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven<br>
To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!<br>
When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew<br>

Favour from thee, and so I gave and gave<br>
To the void air, bidding them find out love:<br>
But when I came to feel how far above<br>
All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,<br>
All earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,<br>
Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,–<br>
Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,<span class="rmn">750</span><br>
Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,<br>
And languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,<br>
Am I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe<br>
Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave<br>
With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,<br>
Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!<br>
I may not be thy love: I am forbidden–<br>
Indeed I am–thwarted, affrighted, chidden,<br>
By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.<br>
Twice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth<span class="rmn">760</span><br>
Ask me no more! I may not utter it,<br>
Nor may I be thy love. We might commit<br>
Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;<br>
We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!<br>

What ails thee?" He could bear no more, and so<br>
Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,<br>
And twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:<br>
"I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!<br>
My only visitor! not ignorant though,<br>
That those deceptions which for pleasure go<span class="rmn">860</span><br>
'Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:<br>

For to thy tongue will I all health confide.<br>
And, for my sake, let this young maid abide<br>
With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,<br>
Peona, mayst return to me. I own<br>
This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,<br>
Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl<br>
Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!<br>
Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share<span class="rmn">880</span><br>

And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind<br>

Of jubilee to Dian:–truth I heard!<br>
Well then, I see there is no little bird,<br>

<span class="indented">As feels a dreamer what doth most create</span><br>
His own particular fright, so these three felt:<br>
Or like one who, in after ages, knelt<span class="rmn">900</span><br>
To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine<br>
After a little sleep: or when in mine<br>
Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends<br>
Who know him not. Each diligently bends<br>
Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;<br>
Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,<br>
By thinking it a thing of yes and no,<br>
That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow<br>
Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last<br>
Endymion said: "Are not our fates all cast?<span class="rmn">910</span><br>
<!-- Page 208 -->
Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!<br>
Adieu!" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,<br>
Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot<br>
His eyes went after them, until they got<br>
Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,<br>
In one swift moment, would what then he saw<br>
Engulph for ever. "Stay!" he cried, "ah, stay!<br>
Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.<br>
Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.<br>
It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,<span class="rmn">920</span><br>
Peona, ye should hand in hand repair<br>
Into those holy groves, that silent are<br>
Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,<br>
At vesper's earliest twinkle–they are gone–<br>
But once, once, once again–" At this he press'd<br>
His hands against his face, and then did rest<br>
His head upon a mossy hillock green,<br>
And so remain'd as he a corpse had been<br>
All the long day; save when he scantly lifted<br>
His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted<span class="rmn">930</span><br>
With the slow move of time,–sluggish and weary<br>
Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,<br>
<!-- Page 209 -->
Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,<br>
And, slowly as that very river flows,<br>
Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:<br>
"Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent<br>
Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall<br>
Before the serene father of them all<br>
Bows down his summer head below the west.<br>
Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,<span class="rmn">940</span><br>
But at the setting I must bid adieu<br>
To her for the last time. Night will strew<br>
On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,<br>
And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves<br>
To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.<br>
Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord<br>
Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,<br>
Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;<br>
My kingdom's at its death, and just it is<br>
That I should die with it: so in all this<span class="rmn">950</span><br>
We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,<br>
What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe<br>
I am but rightly serv'd." So saying, he<br>
Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;<br>
<!-- Page 210 -->
Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,<br>
As though they jests had been: nor had he done<br>
His laugh at nature's holy countenance,<br>
Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,<br>
And then his tongue with sober seemlihed<br>
Gave utterance as he entered: "Ha!" I said,<span class="rmn">960</span><br>
"King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,<br>
And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,<br>
This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,<br>
And the Promethean clay by thief endued,<br>
By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head<br>
Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed<br>
Myself to things of light from infancy;<br>
And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,<br>
Is sure enough to make a mortal man<br>
Grow impious." So he inwardly began<span class="rmn">970</span><br>
On things for which no wording can be found;<br>
Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd<br>
Beyond the reach of music: for the choir<br>
Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar<br>
Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull<br>
The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,<br>
<!-- Page 211 -->
Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.<br>
He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,<br>
Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight<br>
By chilly finger'd spring. "Unhappy wight!<span class="rmn">980</span><br>
Endymion!" said Peona, "we are here!<br>
What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"<br>
Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand<br>
Press'd, saying: "Sister, I would have command,<br>
If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."<br>
At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate<br>
And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,<br>
To Endymion's amaze: "By Cupid's dove,<br>
And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth<br>
Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"<span class="rmn">990</span><br>
And as she spake, into her face there came<br>
Light, as reflected from a silver flame:<br>
Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display<br>
Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day<br>
Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld<br>
Phœbe, his passion! joyous she upheld<br>
Her lucid bow, continuing thus: "Drear, drear<br>

And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state<span class="rmn">1000</span><br>
Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change<br>
Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range<br>
These forests, and to thee they safe shall be<br>
As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee<br>
To meet us many a time." Next Cynthia bright<br>
Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:<br>
Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown<br>
Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.<br>
She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,<br>
Before three swiftest kisses he had told,<span class="rmn">1010</span><br>
They vanish'd far away!–Peona went<br>
Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.<br>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
