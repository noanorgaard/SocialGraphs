'while boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of pavia the "consolation of philosophy"; a golden volume, not unworthy of the leisure of plato or tully, but which claims {ix} incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. the celestial guide [2] , whom he had so long invoked at rome and at athens, now condescended to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her salutary balm. she taught him to compare his long prosperity and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy of fortune [3] . reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value [4] ; he had enjoyed them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had left him virtue [5] . from the earth, boethius ascended to heaven in search of the supreme good [6] , explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance and destiny [7] , of prescience and freewill, of time and eternity, and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of the deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and physical government [8] . such topics of consolation, so obvious, so vague, or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature. yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labour of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine, in the same work, the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. suspense, the worst of evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed, and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of theodoric. a strong cord was fastened round the head of boethius, and forcibly tightened till his eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired. but his genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of the latin world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the most glorious of the english kings, and the third emperor of the name of otho removed to a more honourable tomb the bones of a catholic saint, who, from his arian persecutors, had acquired the honours of martyrdom and the fame of miracles. in the last hours of boethius, he derived some comfort from the {x} safety of his two sons, of his wife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable symmachus. but the grief of symmachus was indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to lament, he might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. he was dragged in chains from rome to the palace of ravenna; and the suspicions of theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged senator.' this deed of injustice brought small profit to its perpetrator; for we read that theodoric's own death took place shortly afterwards; and that, on his death-bed, 'he expressed in broken murmurs to his physician elpidius, his deep repentance for the murders of boethius and symmachus.' § 4. for further details, i beg leave to refer the reader to the essay on 'boethius' by h. f. stewart, published by w. blackwood and sons, edinburgh and london, in 1891. we are chiefly concerned here with the 'consolation of philosophy,' a work which enjoyed great popularity in the middle ages, and first influenced chaucer indirectly, through the use of it made by jean de meun in the poem entitled le roman de la rose, as well as directly, at a later period, through his own translation of it. indeed, i have little doubt that chaucer's attention was drawn to it when, somewhat early in life, he first perused with diligence that remarkable poem; and that it was from the following passage that he probably drew the inference that it might be well for him to translate the whole work :— 'ce puet l'en bien des clers enquerre qui boëce de confort lisent, et les sentences qui là gisent, dont grans biens as gens laiz feroit qui bien le lor translateroit ' (ll. 5052-6). i.e. in modern english:—'this can be easily ascertained from the learned men who read boece on the consolation of philosophy, and the opinions which are found therein; as to which, any one who would well translate it for them would confer much benefit on the unlearned folk':—a pretty strong hint [9] ! {xi} § 5. the chief events in the life of boethius which are referred to in the present treatise are duly pointed out in the notes; and it may be well to bear in mind that, as to some of these, nothing further is known beyond what the author himself tells us. most of the personal references occur in book i. prose 4, book ii. prose 3, and in book iii. prose 4. in the first of these passages, boethius recalls the manner in which he withstood one conigastus, because he oppressed the poor (l. 40); and how he defeated the iniquities of triguilla, 'provost' ( præpositus ) of the royal household (l. 43). he takes credit for defending the people of campania against a particularly obnoxious fiscal measure instituted by theodoric, which was called 'coemption' ( coemptio ); (l. 59.) this mr. stewart describes as 'a fiscal measure which allowed the state to buy provisions for the army at something under market-price—which threatened to ruin the province.' he tells us that he rescued decius paulinus, who had been consul in 498, from the rapacity of the officers of the royal palace (l. 68); and that, in order to save decius albinus, who had been consul in 493, from wrongful punishment, he ran the risk of incurring the hate of the informer cyprian (l. 75). in these ways, he had rendered himself odious to the court-party, whom he had declined to bribe (l. 79). his accusers were basilius, who had been expelled from the king's service, and was impelled to accuse him by pressure of debt (l. 81); and opilio and gaudentius, who had been sentenced to exile by royal decree for their numberless frauds and crimes, but had escaped the sentence by taking sanctuary. 'and when,' as he tells us, 'the king discovered this evasion, he gave orders that, unless they quitted ravenna by a given day, they should be branded on the forehead with a hot iron and driven out of the city. nevertheless on that very day the information laid against me by these men was admitted' (ll. 89-94). he next alludes to some forged letters (l. 123), by means of which he had been accused of 'hoping for the freedom of rome,' (which was of course interpreted to mean that he wished to deliver rome from the tyranny of theodoric). he then boldly declares that if he had had the opportunity of confronting his accusers, he would have answered in the words of canius, when accused by caligula of having been privy to a conspiracy against him—'if i had known it, thou shouldst never have known it' (ll. 126-135). this, by the way, was rather an {xii} imprudent expression, and probably told against him when his case was considered by theodoric. he further refers to an incident that took place at verona (l. 153), when the king, eager for a general slaughter of his enemies, endeavoured to extend to the whole body of the senate the charge of treason, of which albinus had been accused; on which occasion, at great personal risk, boethius had defended the senate against so sweeping an accusation. in book ii. prose 3, he refers to his former state of happiness and good fortune (l. 26), when he was blessed with rich and influential parents-in-law, with a beloved wife, and with two noble sons; in particular (l. 35), he speaks with justifiable pride of the day when his sons were both elected consuls together, and when, sitting in the circus between them, he won general praise for his wit and eloquence. in book iii. prose 4, he declaims against decoratus, with whom he refused to be associated in office, on account of his infamous character. § 6. the chief source of further information about these circumstances is a collection of letters (variæ epistolæ) by cassiodorus, a statesman who enjoyed the full confidence of theodoric, and collected various state-papers under his direction. these tell us, in some measure, what can be said on the other side. here cyprian and his brother opilio are spoken of with respect and honour; and the only decoratus whose name appears is spoken of as a young man of great promise, who had won the king's sincere esteem. but when all has been said, the reader will most likely be inclined to think that, in cases of conflicting evidence, he would rather take the word of the noble boethius than that of any of his opponents. § 7. the treatise 'de consolatione philosophiæ' is written in the form of a discourse between himself and the personification of philosophy, who appears to him in his prison, and endeavours to soothe and console him in his time of trial. it is divided (as in this volume) into five books; and each book is subdivided into chapters, entitled metres and proses, because, in the original, the alternate chapters are written in a metrical form, the metres employed being of various kinds. thus metre 1 of book i is written in alternate hexameters and pentameters; while metre 7 consists of very short lines, each consisting of a single dactyl and {xiii} spondee. the proses contain the main arguments; the metres serve for embellishment and recreation. in some mss. of chaucer's translation, a few words of the original are quoted at the beginning of each prose and metre, and are duly printed in this edition, in a corrected form. § 8. a very brief sketch of the general contents of the volume may be of some service. book i. boethius deplores his misfortunes (met. 1). philosophy appears to him in a female form (pr. 2), and condoles with him in song (met. 2); after which she addresses him, telling him that she is willing to share his misfortunes (pr. 3). boethius pours out his complaints, and vindicates his past conduct (pr. 4). philosophy reminds him that he seeks a heavenly country (pr. 5). the world is not governed by chance (pr. 6). the book concludes with a lay of hope (met. 7). book ii. philosophy enlarges on the wiles of fortune (pr. 1), and addresses him in fortune's name, asserting that her mutability is natural and to be expected (pr. 2). adversity is transient (pr. 3), and boethius has still much to be thankful for (pr. 4). riches only bring anxieties, and cannot confer happiness (pr. 5); they were unknown in the golden age (met. 5). neither does happiness consist in honours and power (pr. 6). the power of nero only taught him cruelty (met. 6). fame is but vanity (pr. 7), and is ended by death (met. 7). adversity is beneficial (pr. 8). all things are bound together by the chain of love (met. 8). book iii. boethius begins to receive comfort (pr. 1). philosophy discourses on the search for the supreme good ( summum bonum ; pr. 2). the laws of nature are immutable (met. 2). all men are engaged in the pursuit of happiness (pr. 3). dignities properly appertain to virtue (pr. 4). power cannot drive away care (pr. 5). glory is deceptive, and the only true nobility is that of character (pr. 6). happiness does not consist in corporeal pleasures (pr. 7); nor in bodily strength or beauty (pr. 8). worldly bliss is insufficient and false; and in seeking true felicity, we must invoke god's aid (pr. 9). boethius sings a hymn to the creator (met. 9); and acknowledges that god alone is the supreme good (p. 10). the unity of soul and body is necessary to existence, and the love of life is instinctive (pr. 11). error is dispersed by the light of truth (met. 11). god governs the world, and is all-sufficient, whilst evil has no true existence (pr. 12). the book ends with the story of orpheus (met. 12). book iv. this book opens with a discussion of the existence of evil, and the system of rewards and punishments (pr. 1). boethius describes the flight of imagination through the planetary spheres till it reaches heaven itself (met. 1). the good are strong, but the wicked are powerless, having no real existence (pr. 2). tyrants are chastised by their own passions (met. 2). virtue secures reward; but the wicked lose even their human nature, and become as mere beasts (pr. 3). consider the enchantments of circe, though these merely affected the outward form (met. 4). the wicked are thrice wretched; they will to do evil, they can do evil, and they actually do it. virtue is its own reward; so that the wicked should excite our pity (pr. 4). here follows {xiv} a poem on the folly of war (met. 4). boethius inquires why the good suffer (pr. 5). philosophy reminds him that the motions of the stars are inexplicable to one who does not understand astronomy (met. 5). she explains the difference between providence and destiny (pr. 6). in all nature we see concord, due to controlling love (met. 6). all fortune is good; for punishment is beneficial (pr. 7). the labours of hercules afford us an example of endurance (met. 7). book v. boethius asks questions concerning chance (pr. 1). an example from the courses of the rivers tigris and euphrates (met. 1). boethius asks questions concerning free-will (pr. 2). god, who sees all things, is the true sun (met. 2). boethius is puzzled by the consideration of god's predestination and man's free-will (pr. 3). men are too eager to inquire into the unknown (met. 3). philosophy replies to boethius on the subjects of predestination, necessity, and the nature of true knowledge (pr. 4); on the impressions received by the mind (met. 4); and on the powers of sense and imagination (pr. 5). beasts look downward to the earth, but man is upright, and looks up to heaven (met. 5). this world is not eternal, but only god is such; whose prescience is not subject to necessity, nor altered by human intentions. he upholds the good, and condemns the wicked; therefore be constant in eschewing vice, and devote all thy powers to the love of virtue (pr. 6). § 9. it is unnecessary to enlarge here upon the importance of this treatise, and its influence upon medieval literature. mr. stewart, in the work already referred to, has an excellent chapter 'on some ancient translations' of it. the number of translations that still exist, in various languages, sufficiently testify to its extraordinary popularity in the middle ages. copies of it are found, for example, in old high german by notker, and in later german by peter of kastl; in anglo-french by simun de fraisne; in continental french by jean de meun [10] , pierre de paris, jehan de cis, frere renaut de louhans, and by two anonymous authors; in italian, by alberto della piagentina and several others; in greek, by maximus planudes; and in spanish, by fra antonio ginebreda; besides various versions in later times. but the most interesting, to us, are those in english, which are somewhat numerous, and are worthy of some special notice. i shall here dismiss, as improbable and unnecessary, a suggestion sometimes made, that chaucer may have consulted some french version in the hope of obtaining assistance from it; there is no sure trace of anything of the kind, and the internal evidence is, in my opinion, decisively against it. § 10. the earliest english translation is that by king ælfred, which is particularly interesting from the fact that the royal author {xv} frequently deviates from his original, and introduces various notes, explanations, and allusions of his own. the opening chapter, for example, is really a preface, giving a brief account of theodoric and of the circumstances which led to the imprisonment of boethius. this work exists only in two mss., neither being of early date, viz. ms. cotton, otho a vi, and ms. bodley ne. c. 3. 11. it has been thrice edited; by rawlinson, in 1698; by j. s. cardale, in 1829; and by s. fox, in 1864. the last of these includes a modern english translation, and forms one of the volumes of bohn's antiquarian library; so that it is a cheap and accessible work. moreover, it contains an alliterative verse translation of most of the metres contained in boethius (excluding the proses ), which is also attributed to ælfred in a brief metrical preface; but whether this ascription is to be relied upon, or not, is a difficult question, which has hardly as yet been decided. a summary of the arguments, for and against ælfred's authorship, will be found in wülker's grundriss zur geschichte der angelsächsischen litteratur , pp. 421-435. § 11. i may here mention that there is a manuscript copy of this work by boethius, in the original latin, in corpus christi college, cambridge, no. 214, which contains a considerable number of anglo-saxon glosses. a description of this ms., by prof. j. w. bright and myself, is printed in the american journal of philology, vol. v, no. 4. § 12. the next english translation, in point of date, is chaucer's; concerning which i have more to say below. § 13. in the year 1410, we meet with a verse translation of the whole treatise, ascribed by warton (hist. e. poetry, § 20, ed. 1871, iii. 39) to john walton, capellanus, or john the chaplain, a canon of oseney. 'in the british museum,' says warton, 'there is a correct ms. on parchment [11] of walton's translation of boethius; and the margin is filled throughout with the latin text, written by chaundler above mentioned [i. e. thomas chaundler, among other preferments dean of the king's chapel and of hereford cathedral, chancellor of wells, and successively warden of wykeham's two colleges at winchester and oxford.] there is another less elegant ms. in the same collection [12] . but at the end is this {xvi} note:—'explicit liber boecij de consolatione philosophie de latino in anglicum translatus a.d. 1410, per capellanum ioannem. this is the beginning of the prologue:—"in suffisaunce of cunnyng and witte [13] ." and of the translation:—"alas, i wrecch, that whilom was in welth." i have seen a third copy in the library of lincoln cathedral [14] , and a fourth in baliol college [15] . this is the translation of boethius printed in the monastery of tavistock in 1525 [16] , and in octave stanzas. this translation was made at the request of elizabeth berkeley.' todd, in his illustrations of gower and chaucer, p. xxxi, mentions another ms. 'in the possession of mr. g. nicol, his majesty's bookseller,' in which the above translation is differently attributed in the colophon, which ends thus: 'translatus anno d omi ni millesimo ccccx o . per capellanum iohannem tebaud, alius watyrbeche.' this can hardly be correct [17] . i may here note that this verse translation has two separate prologues. one prologue gives a short account of boethius and his times, and is extant in ms. gg. iv. 18 in the cambridge university library. an extract from the other is quoted below. ms. e museo 53, in the bodleian library, contains both of them. § 14. as to the work itself, metre 1 of book i. and metre 5 of the same are printed entire in wülker's altenglisches lesebuch, ii. 56-9. in one of the metrical prologues to the whole work the following passage occurs, which i copy from ms. royal 18 a xiii :— 'i have herd spek and sumwhat haue y-seyne, of diuerse men [18] , that wounder subtyllye, {xvii} in metir sum, and sum in prosë pleyne, this book translated haue [19] suffishantlye in-to [20] englissh tongë, word for word, wel nye [21] ; bot i most vse the wittes that i haue; thogh i may noght do so, yit noght-for-thye, with helpe of god, the sentence schall i saue. to chaucer, that is floure of rethoryk in englisshe tong, and excellent poete, this wot i wel, no-thing may i do lyk, thogh so that i of makynge entyrmete: and gower, that so craftily doth trete, as in his book, of moralitee, thogh i to theym in makyng am vnmete, ȝit most i schewe it forth, that is in me.' this is an early tribute to the excellence of chaucer and gower as poets. § 15. when we examine walton's translation a little more closely, it soon becomes apparent that he has largely availed himself of chaucer's prose translation, which he evidently kept before him as a model of language. for example, in bk. ii. met. 5, l. 16, chaucer has the expression:—'tho weren the cruel clariouns ful hust and ful stille.' this reappears in one of walton's lines in the form:—'tho was ful huscht the cruel clarioun.' this is poetry made easy, no doubt. in order to exhibit this a little more fully, i here transcribe the whole of walton's translation of this metre, which may be compared with chaucer's rendering at pp. 40, 41 below. i print in italics all the words which are common to the two versions, so as to shew this curious result, viz. that walton was here more indebted to chaucer, than chaucer, when writing his poem of 'the former age,' was to himself. the ms. followed is the royal ms. mentioned above (p. xvi). boethius: book ii: meter v. a verse translation by john walton. full wonder blisseful was that rather age , when mortal men couthe holde hem -selven [22] payed {xviii} to fede hem-selve [23] with-oute suche outerage , with mete that trewe feeldes [24] have arrayed;

the title is thus given by lowndes: 'boetius de consolatione philosophiæ, translated by george coluile, alias coldewel. london: by john cawoode; 1556. 4to.' this work was dedicated to queen mary, and reprinted in 1561; and again, without date. {xix} there is an unprinted translation, in hexameters and other metres, in the british museum (ms. addit. 11401), by bracegirdle, temp. elizabeth. see warton, ed. hazlitt, iii. 39, note 6. lowndes next mentions a translation by j. t., printed at london in 1609, 12mo. a translation 'anglo-latine expressus per s. e. m.' was printed at london in quarto, in 1654, according to hazlitt's hand-book to popular literature. next, a translation into english verse by h. conningesbye, in 1664, 12mo. the next is thus described: 'of the consolation of philosophy, made english and illustrated with notes by the right hon. richard (graham) lord viscount preston. london; 1695, 8vo. second edition, corrected; london; 1712, 8vo.' a translation by w. causton was printed in london in 1730; 8vo. a translation by the rev. philip ridpath, printed in london in 1785, 8vo., is described by lowndes as 'an excellent translation with very useful notes, and a life of boethius, drawn up with great accuracy and fidelity.' a translation by r. duncan was printed at edinburgh in 1789, 8vo.; and an anonymous translation, described by lowndes as 'a pitiful performance,' was printed in london in 1792, 8vo. in a list of works which the early english text society proposes shortly to print, we are told that 'miss pemberton has sent to press her edition of the fragments of queen elizabeth's englishings (in the record office) from boethius, plutarch, &c.' § 17. i now return to the consideration of chaucer's translation, as printed in the present volume. i do not think the question as to the probable date of its composition need detain us long. it is so obviously connected with 'troilus' and the 'house of fame,' which it probably did not long precede, that we can hardly be wrong in dating it, as said above, about 1377-1380; or, in round numbers, about 1380 or a little earlier. i quite agree with mr. stewart (essay, p. 226), that, 'it is surely most reasonable to connect its composition with those poems which contain the greatest number of recollections and imitations of his original;' and i see no reason for ascribing it, with professor morley (english writers, v. 144), to chaucer's {xx} youth. even mr. stewart is so incautious as to suggest that chaucer's 'acquaintance with the works of the roman philosopher ... would seem to date from about the year 1369, when he wrote the deth of blaunche.' when we ask for some tangible evidence of this statement, we are simply referred to the following passages in that poem, viz. the mention of 'tityus (588); of fortune the debonaire (623); fortune the monster (627); fortune's capriciousness and her rolling wheel (634, 642); tantalus (708); the mind compared to a clean parchment (778); and alcibiades (1055-6);' see essay, p. 267. in every one of these instances, i believe the inference to be fallacious, and that chaucer got all these illustrations, at second hand , from le roman de la rose. as a matter of fact, they are all to be found there; and i find, on reference, that i have, in most instances, already given the parallel passages in my notes. however, to make the matter clearer, i repeat them here. book duch. 588. cf. comment li juisier ticius book duch. 588. cf. s'efforcent ostoir de mangier;

r. r. 8995. as the second of the above lines from the book of the duchesse is obviously taken from le roman , it is probable that the first is {xxi} also; but it is a hard task to discover the particular word monstre in this vast poem. however, i find it, in l. 4917, with reference to fortune; and her wheel is not far off, six lines above. b. d. 634, 642. fortune's capriciousness is treated of by jean de meun at intolerable length, ll. 4863-8492; and elsewhere. as to her wheel, it is continually rolling through his verses;

though it is extremely probable, as was said above, that jean de meun inspired him with the idea of reading it, to see whether it was really worth translating, as the french poet said it was. § 18. when we come to consider the style and manner in which chaucer has executed his self-imposed task, we must first of all make some allowance for the difference between the scholarship of his age and of our own. one great difference is obvious, though constantly lost sight of, viz. that the teaching in those days was almost entirely oral, and that the student had to depend upon his {xxii} memory to an extent which would now be regarded by many as extremely inconvenient. suppose that, in reading boethius, chaucer comes across the phrase 'ueluti quidam clauus atque gubernaculum' (bk. iii. pr. 12, note to l. 55), and does not remember the sense of clauus ; what is to be done? it is quite certain, though this again is frequently lost sight of, that he had no access to a convenient and well-arranged latin dictionary, but only to such imperfect glossaries as were then in use. almost the only resource, unless he had at hand a friend more learned than himself, was to guess. he guesses accordingly; and, taking clauus to mean much the same thing as clauis , puts down in his translation: 'and he is as a keye and a stere.' some mistakes of this character were almost inevitable; and it must not greatly surprise us to be told, that the 'inaccuracy and infelicity' of chaucer's translation 'is not that of an inexperienced latin scholar, but rather of one who was no latin scholar at all,' as mr. stewart says in his essay, p. 226. it is useful to bear this in mind, because a similar lack of accuracy is characteristic of chaucer's other works also; and we must not always infer that emendation is necessary, when we find in his text some curious error. § 19. the next passage in mr. stewart's essay so well expresses the state of the case, that i do not hesitate to quote it at length. 'given (he says) a man who is sufficiently conversant with a language to read it fluently without paying too much heed to the precise value of participle and preposition, who has the wit and the sagacity to grasp the meaning of his author, but not the intimate knowledge of his style and manner necessary to a right appreciation of either, and—especially if he set himself to write in an uncongenial and unfamiliar form—he will assuredly produce just such a result as chaucer has done. 'we must now glance (he adds) at the literary style of the translation. as ten brink has observed, we can here see as clearly as in any work of the middle ages what a high cultivation is requisite for the production of a good prose. verse, and not prose, is the natural vehicle for the expression of every language in its infancy, and it is certainly not in prose that chaucer's genius shews to best advantage. the restrictions of metre were indeed to him as silken fetters, while the freedom of prose only served to embarrass him; just as a bird that has been born and bred in captivity, whose traditions are all domestic, finds itself at a sad loss when it escapes {xxiii} from its cage and has to fall back on its own resources for sustenance. in reading "boece," we have often as it were to pause and look on while chaucer has a desperate wrestle with a tough sentence; but though now he may appear to be down, with a victorious knee upon him, next moment he is on his feet again, disclaiming defeat in a gloss which makes us doubt whether his adversary had so much the best of it after all. but such strenuous endeavour, even when it is crowned with success, is strange in a writer one of whose chief charms is the delightful ease, the complete absence of effort, with which he says his best things. it is only necessary to compare the passages in boethius in the prose version with the same when they reappear in the poems, to realise how much better they look in their verse dress. let the reader take troilus' soliloquy on freewill and predestination (bk. iv. ll. 958-1078), and read it side by side with the corresponding passage in "boece" (bk. v. proses 2 and 3), and he cannot fail to feel the superiority of the former to the latter. with what clearness and precision does the argument unfold itself, how close is the reasoning, how vigorous and yet graceful is the language! it is to be regretted that chaucer did not do for all the metra of the "consolation" what he did for the fifth of the second book. a solitary gem like "the former age" makes us long for a whole set [32] . sometimes, whether unconsciously or of set purpose, it is difficult to decide, his prose slips into verse :— it lyketh me to shewe, by subtil song, with slakke and délitáble soun of strenges (bk. iii. met. 2. 1). whan fortune, with a proud right hand (bk. ii. met. 1. 1) [33] .' the reader should also consult ten brink's history of english literature, book iv. sect. 7. i here give a useful extract. {xxiv} 'this version is complete, and faithful in all essential points. chaucer had no other purpose than to disclose, if possible wholly, the meaning of this famous work to his contemporaries; and notwithstanding many errors in single points, he has fairly well succeeded in reproducing the sense of the original. he often employs for this purpose periphrastic turns, and for the explanation of difficult passages, poetical figures, mythological and historical allusions; and he even incorporates a number of notes in his text. his version thus becomes somewhat diffuse, and, in the undeveloped state of prose composition so characteristic of that age, often quite unwieldy. but there is no lack of warmth, and even of a certain colouring.... 'the language of the translation shews many a peculiarity; viz. numerous latinisms, and even roman idioms in synthesis, inflexion, or syntax, which are either wholly absent or at least found very rarely in chaucer's poems. the labour of this translation proved a school for the poet, from which his powers of speech came forth not only more elevated but more self-reliant; and above all, with a greater aptitude to express thoughts of a deeper nature.' § 20. most of the instances in which chaucer's rendering is inaccurate, unhappy, or insufficient are pointed out in the notes. i here collect some examples, many of which have already been remarked upon by dr. morris and mr. stewart. i. met. 1. 3. rendinge muses: 'lacerae camenae.' i.

" r. 8. 29. of a beest that highte lynx: 'lynceis;' (see the note). iii. pr. 9. 16. wenest thou that he, that hath nede of power, that him ne lakketh no-thing? 'an tu arbitraris quod nihilo indigeat egere potentia?' on this mr. stewart remarks that 'it is easy to see that indigeat and egere have changed places.' to me, it is not quite easy; for the senses of the m.e. nede and lakken are very slippery. suppose we make them change places, and read:—'wenest thou that he, that hath lak of power, that him ne nedeth no-thing?' this may be better, but it is not wholly satisfactory. iii. pr.9. 39-41. that he ... yif him nedeth = whether he needeth. a very clumsy passage; see the latin quoted in the note. iii. pr. 10. 165. the soverein fyn and the cause: 'summa, cardo, atque caussa.' iii. pr. 12. 55, 67. a keye: 'clauus;' and again, 'clauo.' iii. p " . 12. 55, 74. a yok of misdrawinges: 'detrectantium iugum.' iii. p " . 12. 55, 75. the savinge of obedient thinges: 'obtemperantium salus.' iii. pr. 12. 136. the whiche proeves drawen to hem-self hir feith and hir acord, everich of hem of other: 'altero ex altero fidem trahente ... probationibus.'

'uelut hiante ualli robore.' here mr. stewart quotes the reading of ms. a., viz. 'so as the strengthe of the paleys schynyng is open.' but the english text in that ms. is corrupt. the correct reading is 'palis chyning;' where palis means palisade , and translates ualli ; and chyning is open means is gaping open , and translates hiante . ii. pr. 5. 16. lat. 'largiendi usu.' the translation has: 'by usage of large yevinge of him that hath yeven it .' i fail to see much amiss; for the usual sense of large in m. e. is liberal , bounteous , lavish . of course we must not substitute the modern sense without justification. ii. pr. 5. 35. 'of the laste beautee' translates lat. 'postremae pulcritudinis.' for this, see my note on p. 431. ii. pr. 7. 38. lat. 'tum commercii insolentia.' chaucer has: 'what for defaute of unusage and entrecomuninge of marchaundise.' there is not much amiss; but ms. a. omits the word and after unusage , which of course makes nonsense of the passage. ii. met. 8. 6. lat. 'ut fluctus auidum mare certo fine coerceat.' chaucer has: 'that the see, greedy to flowen, constreyned with a certein ende hise floodes.' mr. stewart understands 'greedy to flowen' to refer to 'fluctus auidum.' it seems to me that this was merely chaucer's first idea of the passage, and that he afterwards meant 'hise floodes' to translate 'fluctus,' but forgot to strike out 'to flowen.' i do not defend the translation. iii. pr. 11. 86. lat. 'sede;' eng. 'sete.' this is quite right. mr. stewart quotes the eng. version as having 'feete,' but this is only a corrupt reading, though found in the best ms. any one {xxvii} who is acquainted with m. e. mss. will easily guess that 'feete' is merely mis-copied from 'ſeete,' with a long s ; and, indeed, sete is the reading of the black-letter editions. there is a blunder here, certainly; only it is not the author's, but due to the scribes. iv. pr. 6. 176. lat. 'quidam me quoque excellentior:' eng. 'a philosophre, the more excellent by me.' the m. e. use of by is ambiguous; it frequently means 'in comparison with.' v. met. 5. 14. lat. 'male dissipis:' eng. 'wexest yvel out of thy wit.' in this case, wexest out of thy wit translates dissipis ; and yvel , which is here an adverb, translates male . of course we must also make allowances for the variations in chaucer's latin ms. from the usually received text. here we are much assisted by ms. c., which, as explained below, appears to contain a copy of the very text which he consulted, and helps to settle several doubtful points. to take two examples. in book ii. met. 5. 17, chaucer has 'ne hadde nat deyed yit armures ,' where the usual lat. text has 'tinxerat arua .' but many mss. have arma ; and, of these, ms. c. is one. once more, in book ii. met. 2. 11, chaucer has 'sheweth other gapinges,' where the usual lat. text has ' altos pandit hiatus.' but some mss. have alios ; and, of these, ms. c. is one. § 22. after all, the chief point of interest about chaucer's translation of boethius is the influence that this labour exercised upon his later work, owing to the close familiarity with the text which he thus acquired. i have shewn that we must not expect to find such influence upon his earliest writings; and that, in the case of the book of the duchesse, it affected him at second hand, through jean de meun. but in other poems, viz. troilus, the house of fame, the legend of good women, some of the balades, and in the canterbury tales, the influence of boethius is frequently observable; and we may usually suppose such influence to have been direct and immediate; nevertheless, we should always keep an eye on le roman de la rose, for jean de meun was, in like manner, influenced in no slight degree by the same work. i have often taken an opportunity of pointing out, in my notes to chaucer, passages of this character; and i find that mr. stewart, with praiseworthy diligence, has endeavoured to give (in appendix b, following his essay, at p. 260) 'an index of passages in chaucer which seem to have been {xxviii} suggested by the de consolatione philosophiae.' very useful, in connection with this subject, is the list of passages in which chaucer seems to have been indebted to le roman de la rose, as given by dr. e. köppel in anglia , vol. xiv. 238-265. another most useful help is the comparison between troilus and boccaccio's filostrato , by mr. w. m. rossetti; which sometimes proves, beyond all doubt, that a passage which may seem to be due to boethius, is really taken from the italian poet. as this seems to be the right place for exhibiting the results thus obtained, i proceed to give them, and gladly express my thanks to the above-named authors for the opportunity thus afforded. § 23. comparison with 'boece' of other works by chaucer. troilus and criseyde: book i. 365.

and it is not unlikely that the same is true with respect to the others. but the following tales ( as revised ) seem to be later than 'boece,' viz. the knightes tale, the man of lawes tale, and the monkes tale; whilst it is quite certain that the following tales were amongst the latest written, viz. the nonne preestes tale, the three tales in group d (wyf, frere, somnour), the marchantes tale, the squieres tale, the frankeleins tale, the canouns yemannes tale, and the maunciples tale; all of which are in the heroic couplet, and later than 1385. the case of the knightes tale is especially interesting; for the numerous references in it to boece, and the verbal resemblances between it and troilus shew that either the original palamoun and arcite was written just after those works, or else (which is more likely) it was revised, and became the knight's tale, nearly at that time. the connection between palamon and arcite, anelida, and the parlement of foules, and the introduction of three stanzas from the teseide near the end of troilus, render the former supposition unlikely; whilst at the same time we are confirmed in the impression that the (revised) knightes tale succeeded boece and troilus at no long interval, and was, in fact, the first of the canterbury tales that was written expressly for the purpose of being inserted in that collection, viz. about 1385-6. § 25. the manuscripts. i have now to explain the sources of the present edition. 1. ms. c. = ms. camb. ii. 3. 21. this ms., in the cambridge university library, is certainly the best; and has therefore been taken as the basis of the text. the english portion of it was printed by dr. furnivall for the chaucer society in 1886; and i have usually relied upon this very useful edition [40] . it is a fine folio ms., wholly occupied with boethius ( de consolatione philosophiae ), and comments upon it. {xxxviii} it is divided into two distinct parts, which have been bound up together. the latter portion consists of a lengthy commentary upon boethius, at the end of which we find the title, viz.—'exposicio preclara quam iohannes theutonicus prescripsit et finiuit anno d omi ni m o cccvj viij ydus iunii;' i.e. an excellent commentary, written by johannes teutonicus, and finished june 6, 1306. this vast commentary occupies 118 folios, in double columns. the former part of the volume concerns us more nearly. i take it to be, for all practical purposes, the authentic copy . for it presents the following peculiarities. it contains the whole of the latin text, as well as chaucer's english version; and it is surprising to find that these are written in alternate chapters. thus the volume begins with the latin text of metre 1, at the close of which there follows immediately, on the same page, chaucer's translation of metre 1. next comes prose 1 in latin, followed by prose 1 in english; and so throughout. again, if we examine the latin text, there seems reason to suppose that it fairly represents the very recension which chaucer used. it abounds with side-notes and glosses, all in latin; and the glosses correspond to those in chaucer's version. thus, to take an example, the following lines occur near the end of bk. iii. met. 11 :— 'nam cur rogati sponte recte [41] censetis ni mersus alto uiueret fomes corde.' over rogati is written the gloss i. interrogato . over censetis is written i. iudicatis . over ni is i. nisi ; over mersus alto is i. latenter conditos ; over uiueret is i. vigeret ; and over fomes is i. radix veritatis . besides these glosses, there is here the following side-note:—'nisi radix veritatis latenter conditus vigeret in abscondito mentis, homo non iudicaret recta quacunque ordinata interrogata.' {xxxix} when we turn to chaucer's version, we find that he first gives a translation of the two verses, thus :— 'for wherefor elles demen ye of your owne wil the rightes, whan ye ben axed, but-yif so were that the norisshinge of resoun ne livede y-plounged in the depthe of your herte?' after this he adds, by way of comment:—'this is to seyn, how sholden men demen the sooth of anything that were axed, yif ther nere a rote of soothfastnesse that were y-plounged and hid in naturel principles, the whiche soothfastnesse lived with-in the deepnesse of the thought.' it is obvious that he has here reproduced the general sense of the latin side-note above quoted. the chief thing which is missing in the latin is the expression 'in naturel principles.' but we have only to look to a passage a little higher up, and we find the line— 'suis retrusum possidere thesauris.' over the word retrusum is written i. absconditum ; and over thesauris is i. naturalibus policiis et principiis naturaliter inditis . out of these we have only to pick the words absconditum naturalibus ... principiis , and we at once obtain the missing phrase—'hid in naturel principles.' or, to take another striking example. bk. iv. met. 7 begins, in the ms., with the lines: 'bella bis quinis operatus annis vltor attrides frigie ruinis, fratris amissos thalamos piauit.' at the beginning, just above these, is written a note: 'istud metrum est de tribus exemplis: de agamenone ( sic ); secundum de vlixe; tertium, de hercule.' the glosses are these; over quinis is i. decim ; over attrides is agamenon ( sic ); over fratris is s. menelai ; and over piauit is i. vlcissendo ( sic ) purgauit: troia enim erat metropolis frigie . if we turn to chaucer's version, in which i print the additions to the text in italics, we find that it runs thus :— 'the wreker attrides, that is to seyn, agamenon , that wroughte and continuede the batailes by ten yeer, recovered and purgede in wrekinge , by the destruccioun of troye, the loste chaumbres of {xl} mariage of his brother; this is to seyn, that he, agamenon, wan ayein eleyne, that was menelaus wyf his brother .' we see how this was made up. not a little curious are the spellings attrides and agamenon [42] , as occurring both in the latin part of this ms. and in chaucer's version. again, chaucer has ten , corresponding to the gloss decim , not to the textual phrase bis quinis . his explanation of piauit by recovered and purgede in wrekinge is clearly due to the gloss ulciscendo purgauit . his substitution of troye for frigie is due to the gloss: troia enim erat metropolis frigie . and even the name menelaus his brother answers to fratris, s. menelai . and all that is left, as being absolutely his own, are the words and continuede , recovered , and wan ayein eleyne . we soon discover that, in a hundred instances, he renders a single latin verb or substantive by two english verbs or substantives, by way of making the sense clearer; which accounts for his introduction of the verbs continuede and recovered ; and this consideration reduces chaucer's additional contribution to a mention of the name of eleyne , which was of course extremely familiar to him. similarly, we find in this ms. the original of the gloss explaining coempcioun (p. 11); of the 'glose' on p. 15; of the 'glosa' on p. 26; and of most of the notes which, at first sight, look like additions by chaucer himself [43] . the result is that, in all difficulties, the first authority to be consulted is the latin text in this particular ms.; for we are easily led to conclude that it was intentionally designed to preserve both chaucer's translation and the original text. it does not follow that it is always perfect; for it can only be a copy of the latin, and the scribe may err. in writing recte for recta (see note on p. xxxviii ), he has certainly committed an error by a slip of the pen. the same mistake has been observed to occur in another ms., viz. codex gothanus i. {xli} the only drawback is this. the ms. is so crowded with glosses and side-notes, many of them closely written in small characters, that it is almost impossible to consult them all. i have therefore contented myself with resorting to them for information in difficult passages only. for further remarks on this subject, i must refer the reader to the notes. lastly, i may observe that the design of preserving in this ms. all the apparatus referring to chaucer's boethius, is made the more apparent by the curious fact that, in this ms. only , the two poems by chaucer that are closely related to boethius, viz. the former age, and fortune, are actually inserted into the very body of it, immediately after bk. ii. met. 5. this place was of course chosen because the former age is, to some extent, a verse translation of that metre; and fortune was added because, being founded upon scraps from several chapters, it had no definite claim to any specific place of its own. in this ms., the english text, like the latin one, has a few imperfections. one imperfection appears in certain peculiarities of spelling. the scribe seems to have had some habits of pronunciation that betoken a greater familiarity with anglo-french than with english. the awkward position of the guttural sound of gh in neighebour seems to have been too much for him; hence he substituted ssh (= sh-sh ) for gh , and gives us the spelling neysshebour (bk. ii. pr. 3. 24, foot-note; pr. 7. 57, foot-note.) nevertheless, it is the best ms. and has most authority. for further remarks, see the account of the present edition, on pp. xlvi - xlviii . 2. ms. camb. ii. 1. 38. this ms. also belongs to the cambridge university library, and was written early in the fifteenth century. it contains 8 complete quires of 8 leaves, and 1 incomplete quire of 6 leaves, making 70 leaves in all. the english version appears alone, and occupies 68 leaves, and part of leaf 69 recto; leaf 69, verso, and leaf 70, are blank. the last words are:—'þe eyen of þe iuge þat seeth and demeth alle thinges. explicit liber boecij, &c. ' other treatises, in latin, are bound up with it, but are unrelated. the readings of this ms. agree very closely with those of ii. 3. 21, and of our text. thus, in met. i. l. 9, it has the reading wyerdes , with the gloss s. fata , as in ii. 3. 21. (the scribe at first wrote wyerldes , but the l is marked for expunction.) in l. 12, it has emptid , whereas the addit. ms. has emty ; and in l. 16 it has nayteth , whereas the addit. ms. wrongly {xlii} has naieth . on account of its close agreement with the text, i have made but little use of it. it is worth notice that this ms. (like harl. 2421) frequently has correct readings in cases where even the ms. above described exhibits some blunder. a few such instances are given in the notes. for example, it has the reading wrythith in bk. i. met. 4. 7, where ms. c. has the absurd word writith , and ms. a. has wircheth . in the very next line, it has thonder-leit , and it is highly probable that leit is the real word, and light an ignorant substitution; for leit (answering to a.s. lēget , līget ) is the right m.e. word for 'lightning'; see the examples in stratmann. so again, in bk. ii. met. 3. 13, it reads ouer-whelueth , like the black-letter editions; whilst ms. c. turns whelueth into welueeth , and ms. a. gives the spelling whelweth . in bk. ii. pr. 6. 63, it correctly retains i after may , though mss. c. and a. both omit it. in bk. ii. pr. 8. 17, it has wyndy , not wyndynge ; and i shew (in the note at p. 434) that windy is, after all, the correct reading, since the lat. text has uentosam . in bk. iii. met. 3. 1, it resembles the printed editions in the insertion of the words or a goter after river . in bk. iv. pr. 3. 47, 48, it preserves the missing words: peyne, he ne douteth nat þat he nys entecchid and defouled with . in bk. iv. met. 6. 24, it has the right reading, viz. brethith . finally, it usually retains the word whylom in places where the ms. next described substitutes the word somtyme . if any difficulty in the text raises future discussion, it is clear that this ms. should be consulted. 3. ms. a. = ms. addit. 10340, in the british museum. this is the ms. printed at length by dr. morris for the early english text society, and denoted by the letter 'a.' in my foot-notes. as it is so accessible, i need say but little. it is less correct than ms. ii. 3. 21 in many readings, and the spelling, on the whole, is not so good. the omissions in it are also more numerous, but it occasionally preserves a passage which the cambridge ms. omits. it is also imperfect, as it omits prose 8 and metre 8 of bk. ii., and prose 1 of bk. iii. it has been collated throughout, though i have usually refrained from quoting such readings from it as are evidently inferior or wrong. i notice one peculiarity in particular, viz. that it almost invariably substitutes the word somtyme for the whylom found in other copies; and whylom , in this treatise, is a rather common word. dr. morris's account of the ms. is here copied. {xliii} 'the additional ms. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the force of the final -e . thus he adds it to the preterites of strong verbs, which do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak verbs where it is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles of weak verbs, where it is superfluous. the scribe of the cambridge ms. is careful to preserve the final -e where it is a sign (1) of the definite declension of the adjective; (2) of the plural adjective; (3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of the preterite of weak verbs; (5) of present participles; (6) of the 2nd pers. pret. indic. of strong verbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older vowel-ending. 'the addit. ms. has frequently thilk (singular and plural) and -nes (in wrechednes , &c.), when the camb. ms. has thilke (as usual in the canterbury tales) and -nesse .' the copy of boethius is contained on foll. 3-40. on fol. 41, recto, is a copy of chaucer's truth , and the description of the 'persone,' extracted from the prologue to the cant. tales. the other side of the leaf is blank. this is, in fact, the ms. which i denote by 'at.,' as described in the introduction to the 'minor poems' in vol. i. p. 57. 4. ms. addit. 16165, in the british museum. this is one of shirley's mss., being that which i denote by 'ad.,' and have described in the introduction to the 'minor poems' in vol. i. p. 56. i believe this ms. to be of less value than ms. a. (above), and have therefore not collated it; for even a. is not a very good authority. 5. ms. harl. 2421. the harleian catalogue describes it thus: 'torq. sever. boetius: his 5 books of the comfort of philosophy. translated into english. on vellum, 152 leaves. xv century.' a small quarto ms. of the middle of the fifteenth century. the first prose of bk. i. begins (like ms. a.) with the words: 'in þe mene while þat y stil recorded þese þinges;' &c. hence are derived the readings marked 'h.' in morris's edition, pp. 62-64. it rightly reads writheth , wyndy , bretheth (see p. xlii). 6. the celebrated hengwrt ms. of the canterbury tales (denoted by 'hn.' in the foot-notes to that poem) contains a part of chaucer's boethius. see the second report of the historical mss. commission, p. 106. 7. there is also a copy in a ms. belonging to the cathedral library at salisbury. it was discovered by dr. wülker in 1875; {xliv} see the academy for oct. 5, 1875. bk. i. met. 1 was printed, from this ms., by dr. wülker in anglia , ii. 373. it resembles ms. a. 8. in the phillipps collection, ms. no. 9472 is described as 'boetius' boke of comfort,' and is said to be of the fifteenth century. i do not know its real contents. § 26. the printed editions. caxton. chaucer's boethius was first printed by caxton, without date; but probably before 1479. see the description in the biography and typography of w. caxton, by w. blades; second edition, 1882; p. 213. a complete collation of this text with ms. a., as printed by morris, was printed by l. kellner, of vienna, in englische studien, vol. xiv, pp. 1-53; of which i have gladly availed myself. the text agrees very closely indeed with that printed by thynne in 1532, and resembles ms. c. rather than ms. a. perhaps it is necessary to remark that the readings of ms. c., as given in kellner's collation, are sometimes incorrect, because ms. c. had not at that time been printed, and the readings of that ms. were only known to him from the foot-notes in morris's edition, which are not exhaustive, but only record the more important variations. there is a curious but natural error, for example, in his note on l. 1002 of morris's edition (bk. ii. met. 3. 14, p. 32, l. 1), where ms. c. has ȝeelde (= zeelde ). the word is missing in ms. a., but morris supplied it from c. to complete the text. hence the foot-note has: '[ ȝeelde ]—from c.'; meaning that a. omits ȝeelde , which is supplied from c. this kellner took to mean that a. has ȝeelde , and c. has from . however, the readings of a. and of caxton are given with all possible care and minuteness; and now that c. is also in type, the slight inevitable errors are easily put right. this excellent piece of work has saved me much trouble. it turns out that caxton's text is of great value. he followed a ms. (now lost) which is, in some places, even more correct than ms. c. the following readings are of great importance, as they correct mss. c. and a. (i denote caxton's edition by the symbol cx.) bk. i. met. 4. 7. cx. writheth. (cf. p. xlii. above, l. 6.) {xlv} bk. i. met. 4. 8. cx. thonder leyte [44] . bk. i. met. 5. 26. cx. punisheth. bk. i. met. 5. 28. cx. on the nekkes. bk. i. pr. 6. 54. cx. funden ( but read founden). bk. i. pr. 6. 65. cx. norissing. (perhaps better than norisshinges , as in the mss.; for the lat. text has the sing. fomitem .) cf. bk. iii. met. 11. 27. bk. ii. pr. 3. 59. cx. seeld ( better selde). it is clear that yelde in ms. a. arose from a reading ȝelde , which really meant zelde , the southern form of selde . see below. bk. ii. met. 3. 14. cx. selde ( correctly ). and so again in bk. ii. pr. 6. 15. bk. ii. pr. 6. 63. cx. may i most. (mss. c. a. omit i.) bk. ii. pr. 8. 17. cx. wyndy (which is right; see note, p. 434). bk. iii. pr. 1. 26. cx. thyne ( better thyn, as in thynne). bk. iii. pr. 10. 10. cx. denyed ( or read deneyed). bk. iii. pr. 10. 51. cx. that the fader. (mss. that this prince.) caxton's translation is closer; lat. text, patrem . bk. iii. pr. 11. 116. cx. slepen. bk. iii. pr. 11. 152. cx. maistow (thynne has mayst thou) ms. c. omits thou; and ms. a. is defective. bk. iii. pr. 12. 143. cx. parmenides. bk. iv. pr. 6. 52. cx. be cleped. bk. iv. pr. 6. 188, 189. cx. and some dispyse that they mowe not here ( misprint for bere). mss. c. and a. omit this clause. bk. v. pr. 1. 9, 10. cx. assoilen to the the dette (where the former the = thee). bk. v. pr. 3. 142. cx. impetren. in a few places, caxton's text is somewhat fuller than that of the mss. thus in bk. ii. pr. 3. 8, cx. has: thei ben herd and sowne in eeres thei, &c. however, the lat. text has merely: 'cum audiuntur.' and again, only 9 lines lower (l. 17), cx. inserts and ajuste after moeve ; but the lat. text has merely: 'admouebo.' in some cases, it is closer to the latin text; as, e. g. in bk. i. met. 3. 9, where cx. has kaue (lat. antro ), whereas mss. c. and a. have the pl. kaues . in bk. i. pr. 3. 41, where c. has the e. form sorans , cx. preserves the latin form soranos . {xlvi} it thus appears that a collation with caxton's text is of considerable service. thynne. thynne's edition of chaucer, printed in 1532, contains boethius. i suspect that thynne simply reprinted caxton's text, without consulting any other authority; for it is hard to detect any difference, except that his spellings are somewhat less archaic. hence this text, by a lucky accident, is an extremely good one, and i have constantly referred to it in all cases of difficulty. readings from this edition are marked in the foot-notes with the symbol 'ed.' the later black-letter copies are mere reprints of thynne's text, each being, as usual, a little worse than its predecessor, owing to the introduction of misprints and later forms. i have consulted the editions of 1550 (undated) and 1561. perhaps the most readable edition is that by chalmers, in vol. i. of his british poets, as it is in roman type. it closely resembles the edition of 1561, and is therefore not very correct. § 27. the present edition. the present edition is, practically, the first in which the preparation of the text has received adequate attention. caxton's edition probably represents a single ms., though a very good one; and all the black-letter editions merely reproduce the same text, with various new errors. dr. morris's edition was unfortunately founded on an inferior ms., as he discovered before the printing of it was completed. dr. furnivall's text reproduces the excellent ms. c., but collation was rightly refrained from, as his object was to give the exact spellings of the ms. for the benefit of students. hence there are several passages, in both of these editions, which do not afford the best sense; in a few places, they are less correct than the black-letter editions. it is also a considerable drawback to the reader, that they reproduce, of course intentionally and fully, the troublesome and obscure punctuation-marks of the mss. finding the ground thus clear, i have taken occasion to introduce the following improvements. the text is founded on ms. c., certainly the best extant authority, which it follows, on the whole, very closely. at the same time, it has been carefully collated throughout with the text of ms. a., and (what is even {xlvii} more important) with the texts printed by caxton and thynne and with the original latin text (1) as given in the edition by obbarius (jena 1843) [45] and (2) as existing in ms. c. the latter usually gives the exact readings of the ms. used by chaucer himself. by taking these precautions, i have introduced a considerable number of necessary corrections, so that we now possess a very close approximation to the original text as it left chaucer's hands. in all cases where emendations are made, the various readings are given in the foot-notes, where 'c.' and 'a.' refer to the two chief mss., and 'ed.' refers to thynne's first edition (1532). but i have intentionally refrained from crowding these foot-notes with inferior readings which are certainly false. some readings from the excellent ms. ii. 1. 38 are given in the notes; i now wish that i had collated it throughout. i have introduced modern punctuation. as i am here entirely responsible, the reader is at liberty to alter it, provided that he is justified in so doing by the latin text. wherever chaucer has introduced explanatory words and phrases which are not in the latin text, i have printed them in italics ; as in lines 6, 7, and 18 on page 1. however, these words and phrases are seldom original; they are usually translated or adapted from some of the latin glosses and notes with which ms. c. abounds; as explained above, at p. xxxviii . i have also adopted an entirely new system of numbering. in dr. morris's edition, every line of the printed text is numbered consecutively, from 1 up to 5219, which is the last line of the treatise. in dr. furnivall's print of ms. c., a new numbering begins on every page, from 1 to 32, 33, 34, or 35. both these methods are entirely useless for general reference. the right method of reference is tyrwhitt's, viz. to treat every chapter separately. thus a reference to 'bk. 1. met. 2' serves for every edition; but i have further taken occasion to number the lines of every chapter, for greater convenience. thus the word acountinge occurs in bk. i. met. 2. 10: and even in referring to a black-letter edition, the number 10 is of some use, since it shews that the word occurs very nearly in the middle of the {xlviii} metre. the usual method of referring to editions by the page is an extremely poor and inconvenient makeshift; and it is really nearly time that editors should learn this elementary lesson. unfortunately, some difficulty will always remain as to the numbering of the lines of prose works, because the length of each line is indefinite. the longest chapter, bk. iv. pr. 6, here extends to 258 lines; the shortest, bk. iii. met. 3, has less than 7 lines. i have also corrected the spelling of ms. c. in a large number of places, but within very narrow limits. the use of the final e in that ms. is exceedingly correct, and has almost always been followed, except where notice to the contrary is given in the notes. my corrections are chiefly limited to the substitution of in for yn , and of i for short y , in such words as bygynnen , for which i write biginnen ; the substitution of y for long i , as in whylom , when the ms. has whilom ; the use of v for the ms. symbol u (where necessary); the substitution of sch or ssh for ss , when the sound intended is double sh ; and the substitution of e and o for ee and oo where the vowels are obviously long by their position in the word. i also substitute -eth and -ed for the variable -eth or -ith , and -ed , -id, or -yd of the ms. such changes render the text more uniformly phonetic, and much more readable, without really interfering with the evidence. changes of a bolder character are duly noted. the introduction of these slight improvements will not really trouble the reader. the trouble has been the editor's; for i found that the only satisfactory way of producing a really good text was to rewrite the whole of it. it seemed worth while to have a useful critical edition of 'boethius' for general reference, because of the considerable use which chaucer himself made of his translation when writing many of his later poems. the notes are all new, in the sense that no annotated edition of chaucer's text has hitherto appeared. but many of them are, necessarily, copied or adapted from the notes to the latin text in the editions by vallinus and valpy. {xlix} introduction to troilus. § 1. date of the work. the probable date is about 1380-2, and can hardly have been earlier than 1379 or later than 1383. no doubt it was in hand for a considerable time. it certainly followed close upon the translation of boethius; see p. vii above. § 2. sources of the work. the chief authority followed by chaucer is boccaccio's poem named il filostrato , in 9 parts or books of very variable length, and composed in ottava rima, or stanzas containing eight lines each. i have used the copy in the opere volgari di g. boccaccio; firenze, 1832. owing to the patient labours of mr. w. m. rossetti, who has collated the filostrato with the troilus line by line, and published the results of his work for the chaucer society in 1875, we are able to tell the precise extent to which chaucer is indebted to boccaccio for this story. the filostrato contains 5704 lines; and the troilus 8239 lines [46] , if we do not reckon in the 12 latin lines printed below, at p. 404 . hence we obtain the following result. total of lines in troilus 8239 adapted from the filostrato (2730 lines, condensed into) 2583 balance due to chaucer 5656 in other words, chaucer's debt to boccaccio amounts to less than one-third of the whole poem; and there remains more than two-thirds of it to be accounted for from other sources. but {l} even after all deductions have been made for passages borrowed from other authors, very nearly two-thirds remain for which chaucer is solely responsible. as in the case of the knightes tale, close investigation shews that chaucer is, after all, less indebted to boccaccio than might seem, upon a hasty comparison, to be the case. as it was found impracticable to give mr. rossetti's results in full, i have drawn up lists of parallel passages in a somewhat rough way, which are given in the notes, at the beginning of every book; see pp. 461 , 467 , 474 , 484 , 494 . these lists are sufficiently accurate to enable the reader, in general, to discover the passages which are in no way due to the filostrato . § 3. i have taken occasion, at the same time, to note other passages for which chaucer is indebted to some other authors. of these we may particularly note the following. in book i, lines 400-420 are translated from petrarch's 88th sonnet, which is quoted at length at p. 464 . in book iii, lines 813-833, 1625-9, and 1744-1768 are all from the second book of boethius (prose 4, 86-120 and 4-10, and metre 8). in book iv, lines 974-1078 are from boethius, book v. in book v, lines 1-14 and 1807-27 are from various parts of boccaccio's teseide ; and a part of the last stanza is from dante. on account of such borrowings, we may subtract about 220 lines more from chaucer's 'balance'; which still leaves due to him nearly 5436 lines. § 4. of course it will be readily understood that, in the case of these 5436 lines, numerous short quotations and allusions occur, most of which are pointed out in the notes. thus, in book ii, lines 402-3 are from ovid, art. amat. ii. 118; lines 716-8 are from le roman de la rose [47] ; and so on. no particular notice need be taken of this, as similar hints are utilised in other poems by chaucer; and, indeed, by all other poets. but there is one particular case of borrowing, of considerable importance, which will be considered below, in § 9 (p. liii ). § 5. it is, however, necessary to observe here that, in taking his story from boccaccio, chaucer has so altered and adapted it as to make it peculiarly his own; precisely as he has done in the case of the knightes tale. sometimes he translates very closely and even neatly, and sometimes he takes a mere hint from a long {li} passage. he expands or condenses his material at pleasure; and even, in some cases, transposes the order of it. it is quite clear that he gave himself a free hand. the most important point is that he did not accept the characters of the three chief actors, troilus, criseyde, and pandarus, as pourtrayed by boccaccio; he did not even accept all the incidents which gave occasion for their behaviour. pandarus is no longer the cousin of criseyde, a young and dashing gallant, but her middle-aged uncle, with blunted perceptions of what is moral and noble. in fact, chaucer's pandarus is a thorough and perfect study of character, drawn with a dramatic skill not inferior to that of shakespeare, and worthy of the author of the immortal prologue to the canterbury tales. i must leave the fuller consideration of these points to others; it is hardly necessary to repeat, at full length, the prefatory remarks by mr. rossetti, whilst at the same time, if i begin to quote from them, i shall hardly know where to stop. see also ten brink's english literature, and morley's english writers, vol. v. § 6. it has been observed that, whilst chaucer carefully read and made very good use of two of boccaccio's works, viz. il filostrato and il teseide, he nowhere mentions boccaccio by name; and this has occasioned some surprise. but we must not apply modern ideas to explain medieval facts, as is so frequently done. when we consider how often mss. of works by known authors have no author's name attached to them, it becomes likely that chaucer obtained manuscript copies of these works unmarked by the author's name; and though he must doubtless have been aware of it, there was no cogent reason why he should declare himself indebted to one in whom englishmen were, as yet, quite uninterested. even when he refers to petrarch in the clerk's prologue (e 27-35), he has to explain who he was, and to inform readers of his recent death. in those days, there was much laxity in the mode of citing authors. § 7. it will help us to understand matters more clearly, if we further observe the haphazard manner in which quotations were often made. we know, for example, that no book was more accessible than the vulgate version of the bible; yet it is quite common to find the most curious mistakes made in reference to it. the author of piers plowman (b. text, iii. 93-95) attributes to solomon a passage which he quotes from job, and {lii} (b. vii. 123) to st. luke, a passage from st. matthew; and again (b. vi. 240) to st. matthew, a passage from st. luke. chaucer makes many mistakes of a like nature; i will only cite here his reference to solomon (cant. tales, a 4330), as the author of a passage in ecclesiasticus. even in modern dictionaries we find passages cited from 'dryden' or 'bacon' at large, without further remark; as if the verification of a reference were of slight consequence. this may help to explain to us the curious allusion to zanzis as being the author of a passage which chaucer must have known was from his favourite ovid (see note to troil. iv. 414), whilst he was, at the same time, well aware that zanzis was not a poet, but a painter (cant. tales, c 16); however, in this case we have probably to do with a piece of our author's delicious banter, since he adds that pandarus was speaking 'for the nonce.' there is another point about medieval quotations which must by no means be missed. they were frequently made, not from the authors themselves, but from manuscript note-books which contained hundreds of choice passages, from all sorts of authors, collected by diligent compilers. thus it was, i strongly suspect, that albertano of brescia was enabled to pour out such quantities of quotations as those which chaucer copied from him in his tale of melibeus. thus it was that borrowers of such note-books often trusted to their strong memories for the words of a quotation, yet forgot or mistook the author's name; as was readily done when a dozen such names occurred on every page. a ms. of this character is before me now. it contains many subjects in alphabetical order. under fortitudo are given 17 quotations which more or less relate to it, from ambrose, gregory, chrysostom, and the rest, all in less than a single page. and thus it was, without doubt, that chaucer made acquaintance with the three scraps of horace which i shall presently consider. it is obvious that chaucer never saw horace's works in the complete state; if he had done so, he would have found a writer after his own heart, and he would have quoted him even more freely than he has quoted ovid. 'chaucer on horace' would have been delightful indeed; but this treat was denied, both to him and to us. § 8. the first and second scraps from horace are hackneyed quotations. 'multa renascentur' occurs in troil. ii. 22 (see note, {liii} p. 468); and 'humano capiti' in troil. ii. 1041 (note, p. 472 ). in the third case (p. 464 ), there is no reason why we should hesitate to accept the theory, suggested by dr. g. latham ( athenæum , oct. 3, 1868) and by professor ten brink independently, that the well-known line (epist. i, 2. 1)— 'troiani belli scriptorem, maxime lolli,' was misunderstood by chaucer (or by some one else who misled him) as implying that lollius was the name of a writer on the trojan war. those who are best acquainted with the ways of medieval literature will least hesitate to adopt this view. it is notorious that first lines of a poem are frequently quoted apart from their context, and repeated as if they were complete; and, however amazing such a blunder may seem to us now, there is really nothing very extraordinary about it. we should also notice that lollius was to chaucer a mere name, which he used, in his usual manner, as a sort of convenient embellishment; for he is inconsistent in his use of it. in book i. 394, 'myn autour called lollius' really means petrarch; whereas in book v. 1653, though the reference is to the filostrato, bk. viii. st. 8, chaucer probably meant no more than that lollius was an author whom the italian poet might have followed [48] . cf. my note to the house of fame, 1468, where the name occurs for the third time. we may also notice that, in book iii. 1325, chaucer bears testimony to the 'excellence' of his 'auctor.' the statement, in book ii. 14, that he took the story 'out of latin' is less helpful than it appears to be; for 'latin' may mean either latin or italian. § 9. i have spoken (§ 4 ) of 'a particular case of borrowing,' which i now propose to consider more particularly. the discovery that chaucer mainly drew his materials from boccaccio seems to have satisfied most enquirers; and hence it has come to pass that one of chaucer's sources has been little regarded, though it is really of some importance. i refer to the historia troiana of guido delle colonne [49] , or, as chaucer rightly {liv} calls him, guido de columpnis, i.e. columnis (house of fame, 1469). chaucer's obligations to this author have been insufficiently explored. when, in 1889, in printing the legend of good women with an accuracy never before attempted, i restored the ms. reading guido for the ouyde of all previous editions in l. 1396, a clue was thus obtained to a new source for some of chaucer's work. it was thus made clear that the legend of hypsipyle and medea was primarily derived from this source; and further, that it was from guido that chaucer derived his use of ilioun to mean the citadel of troy (leg. of good women, 936, and note). in the nonne prestes tale, b 4331, as was pointed out by tyrwhitt long ago, the dream of andromache is taken from guido. and i find in lounsbury's studies in chaucer, ii. 315, the significant but insufficient remark, that 'it was in guido da ( sic ) colonna's work that chaucer found the martial deeds of troilus recounted in full, the slaughter he wrought, and the terror he inspired.' hence we naturally come to the question, what incidents in troilus are expressly due to guido? § 10. before answering this question, it will be best to consider the famous crux , as to the meaning of the word trophee . when lydgate is speaking of his master's troilus, viz. in his prologue to the falls of princes, st. 3, he says that chaucer 'made a translacion of a boke which called is trophe in lumbarde tong,' &c. no book or author is now known by that name; and, as chaucer was in this case much indebted to boccaccio, critics have jumped to the conclusion that trophee means either boccaccio or the filostrato; and this conclusion has been supported by arguments so hopeless as to need no repetition. but it is most likely that lydgate, who does not seem to have known any italian [50] , spoke somewhat casually; and, as chaucer was to some extent indebted to guido, he may possibly have meant guido. so far, i have merely stated a supposition which is, in itself, possible; but i shall now adduce what i believe to be reasonable and solid proof of it. {lv} we have yet another mention of trophee , viz. in chaucer himself! in the monkes tale, b 3307, he says of hercules— 'at bothe the worldes endes, seith trophee , in stede of boundes, he a piler sette.' whence, we may ask, is this taken? my answer is, from guido . § 11. if we examine the sources of the story of hercules in the monkes tale, we see that all the supposed facts except the one mentioned in the two lines above quoted are taken from boethius and ovid (see the notes). now the next most obvious source of information was guido's work, since the very first book has a good deal about hercules, and the legend of hypsipyle clearly shews us that chaucer was aware of this. and, although neither ovid (in met. ix.) nor boethius has any allusion to the pillars of hercules, they are expressly mentioned by guido. in the english translation called the gest historiale of the destruction of troy, ed. panton and donaldson (which i call, for brevity, the alliterative troy-book), l. 308, we read :— 'but the wonders that he wroght in this world here in yche cuntré ben knowen under criste evyn. tow pyllers he pight in a place lowe vppon gades groundes, that he gotton had.' and again, further on, the latin text has:—'locus ille, in quo predicte herculis columpne sunt affixe, dicitur saracenica lingua saphy.' to which is added, that alexander afterwards came to the same spot. when lydgate, in translating guido, comes to this passage, he says :— 'and of the pyllers that at gades he set, which alexsaundre, of macedone the kyng, that was so worthy here in his lyuynge, rood in his conquest, as guydo list to write, with all his hoost proudely to visyte ... and these boundes named be of all of hercules, for he hymselfe theim set as for his markes, all other for to lette ferther to passe, as guydo maketh mynde'; &c. siege of troye, ed. 1555, fol. b6. we can now easily see that, when lydgate speaks of the book 'which called is trophe in lumbarde tong,' he is simply copying the name of the book from chaucer, though he seems also to have heard some rumour of its being so called in italy. {lvi} § 12. why this particular book was so called, we have no means of knowing [51] ; but this does not invalidate the fact here pointed out. of course the latin side-note in some of the mss. of the monkes tale, which explains 'trophee' as referring to 'ille vates chaldeorum tropheus,' must be due to some mistake, even if it emanated (as is possible) from chaucer himself. it is probable that, when the former part of the monkes tale was written, chaucer did not know much about guido's work; for the account of hercules occurs in the very first chapter. perhaps he confused the name of tropheus with that of trogus, i.e. pompeius trogus the historian, whose work is one of the authorities for the history of the assyrian monarchy. § 13. it remains for me to point out some of the passages in troilus which are clearly due to guido, and are not found in boccaccio at all. book i. 145-7:— 'but the troyane gestes, as they felle, in omer, or in dares, or in dyte, who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.' the reference here is simply to guido's history, whence, and not at first hand, both chaucer and his readers could easily get the required information. guido constantly refers to these authors; and, although he speaks disrespectfully of homer [52] , he professes to put great faith in dares and dytes, whose names he frequently cites as being those of his best authorities [53] . with the description of troilus in ll. 1072-1085, it is interesting to compare the words of guido, in book viii. 'troilus vero, licet multum fuit corpore magnus, magis fuit tamen corde magnanimus; animosus multum, set multam habuit in sua {lvii} animositate temperiem; dilectus plurimum a puellis cum ipse aliqualem seruando modestiam delectaretur in illis. in viribus et strenuitate bellandi uel fuit alius hector uel secundus ab ipso . in toto eciam regno troie iuuenis nullus fuit tantis viribus nec tanta audacia gloriosus [54] .' the latter part of this description should be compared with book ii. 157-161, where the very phrase 'ector the secounde' is used; see also ll. 181-189. § 14. book ii. 618. 'the yate ... of dardanus.' the six gates of troy are named in guido, book iv, 'quarum vna dardanides , secunda tymbrea, tercia helyas, quarta chetas, quinta troiana, vltima anthenorides vocabantur.' 'the furst and the fairest fourmet was dardan.' allit. troy-book, l. 1557. lydgate keeps the form 'dardanydes'; cap. xi. fol. f 5. § 15. book iv. 204. 'for he was after traytour to the toun.' the treason of antenor is told by guido at great length; see 'boke xxviii' of the allit. troy-book, p. 364; lydgate, siege of troye, y 6, back. cf. dictys cretensis, lib. iv. c. 22. book iv. 1397, &c. 'for al apollo and his clerkish lawes,' &c. guido gives rather a long account of the manner in which criseyde upbraided her father chalcas at their meeting. chaucer says nothing about this matter in book v. 193, but he here introduces an account of the same speech, telling us that creseyde intended to make it! i quote from book xix. 'sane deceperunt te apollinis friuola responsa, a quo dicis te suscepisse mandatum vt tu paternas lares desereres, et tuos in tanta acerbitate penates [55] sic tuis specialiter hostibus adhereres. sane non fuit ille deus apollo, set, puto, fuit comitiua infernalium furiarum a quibus responsa talia recepisti.' cf. allit. troy-book, 8103-40; and observe that lydgate, in his siege of troye, r 3, back, omits the speech of criseyde to her father, on the ground that it is given in chaucer. yet such is not the case, unless we allow the present passage to stand for it. in book v. 194, chaucer (following boccaccio) expressly says that she was mute ! book iv. 1695-1701. this last stanza is not in boccaccio; but the general sense of it is in guido, book xix, where the interview ends thus:—'set diei aurora quasi superueniente {lviii} uicina, troilus a brisaida in multis anxietatibus et doloribus discessit; et ea relicta ad sui palacii menia properauit.' lydgate, at this point, refers us to chaucer; siege of troye, fol. r 2, back. the allit. troy-book actually does the same; l. 8054. § 16. book v. 92-189. these fourteen stanzas are not in boccaccio. the corresponding passage in guido (book xix) is as follows :— 'troilus et troiani redeunt, grecis eam recipientibus in suo commeatu. inter quos dum esset diomedes, et illam diomedes inspexit, statim in ardore veneris exarsit et eam vehementi desiderio concupiuit, qui collateralis associando brisaidam cum insimul equitarent, sui ardoris flammam continere non valens brisaide reuelat sui estuantis cordis amorem; quam in multis affectuosis verbis et blandiciis necnon et promissionibus reuera magnificis allicere satis humiliter est rogatus. set brisaida in primis monitis, vt mulierum moris est, suum prestare recusauit assensum; nec tamen passa est quin post multa diomedis verba, ipsum nolens a spe sua deicere verbis similibus dixit ei: "amoris tui oblaciones ad presens nec repudio nec admitto, cum cor meum non sit ad presens ita dispositum quod tibi possim aliter respondere."' book v. 799-805 [56] . the description of diomede in boccaccio (fil. vi. 33) is merely as follows :— 'egli era grande e bel della persona, giovane fresco e piacevole assai, e forte e fier siccome si ragiona, e parlante quant'altro greco mai, e ad amor la natura aveva prona.' the account in guido (book viii) is as follows:—'diomedes vero multa fuit proceritate, distensus amplo pectore, robustis scapulis, aspectu ferox; in promissis fallax; in armis strenuus; victorie cupidus; timendus a multis, cum multum esset iniuriosus; sermonibus sibi nimis impaciens, cum molestus seruientibus nimis esset; libidinosus quidem multum, et qui multas traxit angustias ob feruorem amoris.' cf. allit. troy-book, ll. 3794-3803; lydgate, siege of troye, fol. k 1, back. book v. 810. to gon y-tressed, &c. perhaps suggested by {lix} the remark in guido (book xix) that cressid's hair was unbound in her hour of deepest sorrow:—'aureos crines suos a lege ligaminis absolutos a lactea sui capitis cute diuellit.' cf. iv. 736. book v. 827-840. troilus is not described by boccaccio. guido's description of him has already been quoted above; see remarks on book i. 1072; pp. lvi, lvii. book v. 1002-4. the parallel passage in guido has already been quoted, viz.: 'amoris tui oblaciones ad presens nec repudio nec admitto.' see remarks on l. 92; p. lviii. book v. 1013. obviously from guido; the passage follows soon after that last quoted. 'associauit [diomedes] eam vsquequo brisaida recipere in sui patris tentoria se debebat. et ea perueniente ibidem, ipse eam ab equo descendentem promptus adiuit, et vnam de cirothecis [57] , quam brisaida gerebat in manu, ab ea nullo percipiente furtiue subtraxit. set cum ipsa sola presensit, placitum furtum dissimulauit amantis.' for this incident of the glove, cf. allit. troy-book, l. 8092. book v. 1023-1099. this passage is not in boccaccio. several hints for it seem to have been taken from guido, book xix, whence i quote the following. 'nondum dies illa ad horas declinauerat vespertinas, cum iam suas brisaida recentes mutauerat voluntates,' &c.. 'et iam nobilis troili amor ceperat in sua mente tepescere, et sic repente subito facta volubilis se in omnibus variauit. quid est ergo quod dicitur de constancia mulierum,' &c. 'tunc ilico diomedes superuenit . . qui repente in troilum irruit, ipsum ab equo prosternit, ab eo auferens equum suum, quem per suum nuncium specialem ad brisaidam in exennium [58] destinauit, mandans nuncio suo predicto vt brisaide nunciet equum ipsum eius fuisse dilecti . . . . brisaida vero equum troili recepit hilariter, et ipsi nuncio refert hec verba: "dic secure domino tuo quod ilium odio habere non possum, qui me tanta puritate cordis affectat . . . . [diomedes] brisaidam accedit, et eam suplex hortatur vt sibi consenciat in multitudine lacrimarum. set illa, que multum vigebat sagacitatis astucia, diomedem sagacibus machinacionibus differre procurat, ut ipsum afflictum amoris incendio magis affligat, et eius amoris {lx} vehemenciam in maioris augmentum ardoris extollat. vnde diomedi suum amorem non negat, etiam nec promittit."' in l. 1039, read he , i. e. diomede; see my note on the line, at p. 499. in l. 1037, the story means the historia troiana; and in l. 1044, in the stories elles-where means 'elsewhere in the same history.' the passage (in book xxv) is as follows :— 'troilus autem tunc amorem brisaide diomedi obprobriosis verbis improperat; set greci diomedem ... abstraxerunt' ... 'interim brisaida contra patris sui voluntatem videre diomedem in lecto suo iacentem ex vulnere sibi facto frequenter accedit, et licet sciuisset illum a troilo dudum dilecto suo sic vulneratum, multa tamen in mente sua reuoluit; et dum diligenter attendit de se iungenda cum troilo nullam sibi superesse fiduciam, totum suum animum, tanquam varia et mutabilis, sicut est proprium mulierum, in diomedis declinat amorem.' cf. troy-book, ll. 9942-59; lydgate, siege of troye, fol. u 4. book v. 1558-60. the treacherous slaughter of hector by achilles is in guido, near the end of book xxv. see my note to l. 1558, at p. 503. book v. 1771. 'read dares.' this merely means that guido cites dares as his authority for the mighty deeds of troilus. in book xxv, i find:—' scripsit enim dares , quod illo die mille milites interfecit [troilus] ex grecis'; cf. l. 1802 below. so in the allit. troy-book, ll. 9877-9 :— 'as dares of his dedis duly me tellus, a thowsaund thro knightes throng he to dethe, that day with his dynttes, of the derffe grekes.' so lydgate, siege of troye, fol. u 3, back:— 'and, as dares wryteth specyally, a thousand knightes this troyan champyowne that day hath slayne, rydyng vp and downe, as myne auctour guydo lyst endyte; saue after hym , i can no ferther wryte.' i. e. he only knew of dares through the medium of guido. in fact, dares (capp. 29, 31, 32) has 'multos,' not 'mille.' book v. 1849-1855. the introduction of this stanza is quite irrelevant, unless we remember that, in guido, the story of troy is completely mixed up with invectives against idolatry. in book x, there is a detailed account of the heathen gods, the {lxi} worship of which is attributed to the instigation of fiends. see the long account in the allit. troy-book, ll. 4257-4531, concluding with the revelation by apollo to calchas of the coming fall of troy. cf. lydgate, siege of troye, fol. k 6. of course, this notion of the interference of the gods in the affairs of the greeks and trojans is ultimately due to homer. § 17. with regard to the statement in guido, that achilles slew hector treacherously , we must remember how much turns upon this assertion. his object was to glorify the trojans, the supposed ancestors of the roman race, and to depreciate the greeks. the following passage from guido, book xxv, is too characteristic to be omitted. 'set o homere, qui in libris tuis achillem tot laudibus, tot preconiis extulisti, que probabilis racio te induxit, vt achillem tantis probitatis meritis vel titulis exultasses?' such was the general opinion about homer in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. § 18. this is not the place for a full consideration of the further question, as to the sources of information whence boccaccio and guido respectively drew their stories. nor is it profitable to search the supposed works of dares and dictys for the passages to which chaucer appears to refer; since he merely knew those authors by name, owing to guido's frequent appeals to them. nevertheless, it is interesting to find that guido was quite as innocent as were chaucer and lydgate of any knowledge of dares and dictys at first hand. he acquired his great reputation in the simplest possible way, by stealing the whole of his 'history' bodily, from a french romance by benoît de sainte-more, entitled le roman de troie , which has been well edited and discussed by mons. a. joly. mons. joly has shewn that the roman de troie first appeared between the years 1175 and 1185; and that guido's historia troiana is little more than an adaptation of it, which was completed in the year 1287, without any acknowledgment as to its true source. benoît frequently cites dares (or daires), and at the end of his poem, ll. 30095-6, says :— 'ce que dist daires et dithis i avons si retreit et mis.' in his hist. of eng. literature (e. version, ii. 113), ten brink remarks that, whilst chaucer prefers to follow guido rather than {lxii} benoît in his legend of good women, he 'does the exact opposite to what he did in troilus.' for this assertion i can find but little proof. it is hard to find anything in benoît's lengthy romance which he may not have taken, much more easily, from guido. there are, however, just a few such points in book v. 1037-1078. thus, in l. 1038, criseyde gives diomede troilus' horse; cf. benoît, l. 15046—'lo cheval vos presterai.' l. 1043 is from the same, ll. 15102-4 :— 'la destre manche de son braz bone et fresche de ciclaton li done en leu de gonfanon.' ll. 1051-7 answer to the same, beginning at l. 20233; and l. 1074 is from the same, l. 20308:—'dex donge bien à troylus!' i doubt if there is much more. for some further account of the works ascribed to dares phrygius and dictys cretensis, both duly edited among the 'delphin classics,' i must refer the reader to smith's classical dictionary. § 19. the whole question of the various early romances that relate to troy is well considered in a work entitled 'testi inediti di storia trojana, preceduti da uno studio sulla leggenda trojana in italia, per egidio gorra; torino, 1887'; where various authorities are cited, and specimens of several texts are given. at p. 136 are given the very lines of benoît's roman (ll. 795-6) where guido found a reference to the columns of hercules :— 'et les bonnes ilec ficha ou alixandre les trova.' this hint he has somewhat elaborated, probably because he took a personal interest in 'columns,' on account of their reference to his own name—'delle colonne.' i believe that the notion of alexander finding hercules' pillars is due to a rather large blunder in geography. hercules set up his pillars 'at the end of the world,' viz. at the straits of gibraltar, whereas alexander set up his at another 'end of the world,' viz. at the furthest point of india which he succeeded in reaching. so says his romance; see alexander and dindimus, ed. skeat, l. 1137; wars of alexander, l. 5063. the setting up of pillars as boundary-marks seems to have been common; cf. vergil, æn. xi. 262. among the points noticed by gorra, i may mention the following :— 1. some account (p. 7) of the ephemeris belli troiani by {lxiii} dictys cretensis, who, it was pretended, accompanied idomeneus to the trojan war. achilles is depicted in dark colours; he is treacherous towards agamemnon; falls in love with the trojan princess, polyxena; and slays hector by a stratagem. it appears to have been a work of invention, resting upon no greek original. 2. some account (p. 17) of the historia de excidio troiae of dares phrygius, a work which (as was pretended) was discovered by cornelius nepos. this also, in the opinion of most critics, was an original work. at p. 115, there is a comparison of the lists of greek leaders and the number of their ships (cf. homer, il. ii.) as given by dares, benoît, and guido. 3. at p. 123, there is an enumeration of points in which guido varies from benoît. 4. at p. 152, is an account of some italian prose versions of the story of troy. such are: la istorietta trojana, with extracts from it at p. 371; a romance by binduccio dello scelto, with extracts relating to 'troilo e briseida' at p. 404; a version of guido by mazzeo bellebuoni, with extracts relating to 'paride ed elena' at p. 443; an anonymous version, with extracts relating to 'giasone e medea' at p. 458; a version in the venetian dialect, with extracts relating to 'ettore ed ercole' at p. 481; another anonymous version, with extracts at p. 493; and la 'fiorita' of armannino, giudice da bologna, with extracts at p. 532. 5. at p. 265, is an account of italian poetical versions, viz. enfances hector, poema d'achille, il trojano di domenico da montechiello, il trojano a stampa (i.e. a printed edition of il trojano), and l'intelligenza. at p. 336, boccaccio's filostrato is discussed; followed by a brief notice of an anonymous poem, also in ottava rima, called il cantare di insidoria. it appears that boccaccio followed some recension of the french text of benoît, but much of the work is his own invention. in particular, he created the character of pandaro, who resembles a neapolitan courtier of his own period. the most interesting of the extracts given by gorra are those from binduccio dello scelto; at p. 411, we have the incident of diomede possessing himself of briseida's glove, followed by the interview between briseida and her father calcas. at p. 413, diomede overthrows troilus, takes his horse from him and sends it to briseida, who receives it graciously; and at p. 417, briseida gives diomede her sleeve as a love-token, {lxiv} after which a 'jousting' takes place between diomede and troilus, in which the former is badly wounded. for further remarks, we are referred, in particular, to h. dunger's dictys-septimius: über die ursprüngliche abfassung und die quellen der ephemeris belli troiani; dresden, 1878 (programm des vitzthumschen gymnasiums); to another essay by the same author on die sage vom trojanischen kriege, leipzig, 1869; to koerting's dictys und dares, &c., halle, 1874; to a. joly's benoît de sainte-more et le roman de troie, paris, 1871; and to an article by c. wagener on dares phrygius, in philologus , vol. xxxviii. the student may also consult e. meybrinck, die auffassung der antike bei jacques millet, guido de columna, und benoît de ste-more, printed in ausgaben und abhandlungen aus dem gebiete für romanischen philologie, marburg, 1886; where the author concludes that millet was the originator of the story in france. also w. greif, die mittelalterlichen bearbeitungen der trojanersage; marburg, 1886. § 20. a few words may be said as to the names of the characters. troilus is only once mentioned in homer, where he is said to be one of the sons of priam, who were slain in battle, iliad, xxiv. 257; so that his story is of medieval invention, except as to the circumstance of his slayer being achilles, as stated by vergil, æn. i. 474, 475; cf. horace, carm. ii. 9. 16. pandarus occurs as the name of two distinct personages; (1) a lycian archer, who wounded menelaus; see homer, il. iv. 88, vergil, æn. 5. 496; and (2) a companion of æneas, slain by turnus; see vergil, æn. ix. 672, xi. 396. diomede is a well-known hero in the iliad, but his love-story is of late invention. the heroine of benoît's poem is briseida, of whom dares (c. 13) has merely the following brief account: 'briseidam formosam, alta statura, candidam, capillo flauo et molli, superciliis junctis [59] , oculis venustis, corpore aequali, blandam, affabilem, uerecundam, animo simplici, piam'; but he records nothing more about her. the name is simply copied from homer's βρισηΐδα , il. i. 184, the accusative being taken (as often) as a new nominative case; this briseis was the captive assigned to achilles. but boccaccio substitutes for this the form griseida, taken from the accusative of homer's chryseis, mentioned just two lines above, il. i. 182. for this {lxv} italian form chaucer substituted criseyde, a trisyllabic form, with the ey pronounced as the ey in prey . he probably was led to this correction by observing the form chryseida in his favourite author, ovid; see remed. amoris, 469. calchas, in homer, il. i. 69, is a grecian priest; but in the later story he becomes a trojan soothsayer, who, foreseeing the destruction of troy, secedes to the greek side, and is looked upon as a traitor. cf. vergil, æn. ii. 176; ovid, art. amat. ii. 737. § 21. in anglia, xiv. 241, there is a useful comparison, by dr. e. köppel, of the parallel passages in troilus and the french roman de la rose, ed. méon, paris, 1814, which i shall denote by 'r.' these are mostly pointed out in the notes. köppel's list is as follows :— troilus. i. 635 (cf. iii. 328).—rom. rose, 8041. 637.—r. 21819. 747.—r. 7595. 810.—r. 21145. 969—r. 12964. ii. 167.—r. 5684. 193.—r. 8757. 716.—r. 5765. 754.—r. 6676. 784 (cf. iii. 1035).—r. 12844. 1564.—r. 18498. iii. 294.—r. 7085. 328;

sometimes the really coincident lines are found a little further on. the parallel passages common to troilus and boethius are noted above, pp. xxviii - xxx . an excellent and exhaustive treatise on the language of chaucer's troilus, by prof. kitteredge, is now (1893) being printed for the chaucer society. a ryme-index to the same, compiled by myself, has been published for the same society, dated 1891. § 22. i have frequently alluded above to the alliterative 'troy-book,' or 'gest historiale,' edited for the early english text society, in 1869-74, by panton and donaldson. this is useful for reference, as being a tolerably close translation of guido, although a little imperfect, owing to the loss of some leaves and some slight omissions (probably) on the part of the scribe. it is divided into 36 books, which agree, very nearly, with the books into which the original text is divided. the most important passages for comparison with troilus are lines 3922-34 {lxvi} (description of troilus); 3794-3803 (diomede); 7268-89 (fight between troilus and diomede); 7886-7905 (briseida and her dismissal from troy); 8026-8181 (sorrow of troilus and briseida, her departure, and the interviews between briseida and diomede, and between her and calchas her father); 8296-8317 (diomede captures troilus' horse, and presents it to briseida); 8643-60 (death of hector); 9671-7, 9864-82, 9926-9 (deeds of troilus); 9942-59 (briseida visits the wounded diomede); 10055-85, 10252-10311 (deeds of troilus, and his death); 10312-62 (reproof of homer for his false statements). at l. 8053, we have this remarkable allusion; speaking of briseida and troilus, the translator says :— 'who-so wilnes to wit of thaire wo fir [futher], turne hym to troilus , and talke [60] there ynoughe!' i.e. whoever wishes to know more about their wo, let him turn to troilus , and there find enough. this is a clear allusion to chaucer's work by its name, and helps to date the translation as being later than 1380 or 1382. and, as the translator makes no allusion to lydgate's translation of guido, the date of which is 1412-20, we see that he probably wrote between 1382 and 1420 [61] ; so that the date 'about 1400,' adopted in the new eng. dictionary (s. v. bercelet , &c.) cannot be far wrong [62] . § 23. another useful book, frequently mentioned above, is lydgate's siege of troye [61] , of which i possess a copy printed in 1555. this contains several allusions to chaucer's troilus, and more than one passage in praise of chaucer's poetical powers, two of which are quoted in mr. rossetti's remarks on ms. harl. 3943 (chaucer soc. 1875), pp. x, xi. these passages are not very helpful, though it is curious to observe that he speaks of chaucer not only as 'my maister chaucer,' but as 'noble galfride, chefe poete of brytaine,' and 'my maister galfride.' the most notable passages occur in cap. xv, fol. k 2; cap. xxv, fol. r 2, back; and near the end, fol. ee 2. lydgate's translation is much more free {lxvii} than the preceding one, and he frequently interpolates long passages, besides borrowing a large number of poetical expressions from his 'maister.' § 24. finally, i must not omit to mention the remarkable poem by robert henrysoun, called the testament and complaint of criseyde, which forms a sequel to chaucer's story. thynne actually printed this, in his edition of 1532, as one of chaucer's poems, immediately after troilus; and all the black-letter editions follow suit. yet the 9th and 10th stanzas contain these words, according to the edition of 1532 :— 'of his distresse me nedeth nat reherse; for worthy chaucer, in that same boke, in goodly termes, and in ioly verse, compyled hath his cares, who wyl loke. to breke my slepe, another queare i toke, in whiche i founde the fatal desteny of fayre creseyde, whiche ended wretchedly. who wot if al that chaucer wrate was trewe? nor i wotte nat if this narration be authorysed, or forged of the newe of some poete by his inuention, made to reporte the lamentation and woful ende of this lusty creseyde, and what distresse she was in or she deyde.' § 25. the manuscripts. 1. ms. cl. —the campsall ms., on vellum, written before 1413; prepared for henry, prince of wales, afterwards henry v, as shewn by his arms on leaf 2. the poem occupies leaves 2-120; each page usually contains five stanzas. two pages have been reproduced by the autotype process for the chaucer society; viz. leaf 1, recto, containing stanzas 1-5, and leaf 42, verso, containing stanzas 249-251 of book ii, and stanza 1 of book iii. this is a beautifully written ms., and one of the best; but it is disappointing to find that it might easily have been much better. the scribe had a still better copy before him, which he has frequently treated with supreme carelessness; but it is some consolation to find that his mistakes are so obvious that they can easily be corrected. thus, in book i, l. 27, he writes dorst for dorste , though it ruins the grammar and the metre; in l. 31, he actually has hym for hem , to the destruction of the sense; in l. 69, he has {lxviii} high (!) for highte ; and so on. it therefore requires careful control. in particular, the scribe gives many examples of the fault of 'anticipation,' i.e. the fault whereby the mind, swifter than the pen, has induced him to write down letters that belong to a later syllable or word, or to omit one or more letters. thus in book i. l. 80, he omits u in pryuely , writing pryely ; in l. 126, he omits and before hoom ; in l. 198, he omits lewede ; in l. 275, he omits gan ; &c. but the faults of 'anticipation' appear most clearly in such startling forms as addermost for aldermost , i. 248, where the former d is due to the one that is coming; assent for absent , iv. 1642, for a like reason; estal for estat , because the next word is royal , i. 432; þyn for þyng , because the next word is myn , i. 683; nat for nas , because the next word is not , i. 738; seynt for seyn , because the next word is that , v. 369; shad for shal , because the next word is drede , v. 385; liten for litel , because weten follows, iv. 198; make for may , because the line ends with wake , iii. 341; fleld for feld , ii. 195. sometimes, however, the scribe's mind reverts to something already written, so that we find delphebus for delphicus , because phebus precedes, i. 70; bothen for bothe , because deden precedes, i. 82; falles for fallen , after unhappes , ii. 456; daunder for daunger , iii. 1321; tolle for tolde , iii 802; &c. downright blunders are not uncommon; as incocent for innocent (where again the former c is due to the latter), ii. 1723; agarst for agast , iii. 737; right for rit , v. 60. we even find startling variations in the reading, as in iii. 1408 :— 'reson wil not that i speke of shep , for it accordeth nough[t] to my matere.' certainly, shep (sheep) is irrelevant enough; however, chaucer refers to sleep . and again, the line in ii. 1554, which should run— as for to bidde a wood man for to renne appears in the startling form— as for to bydde a womman for to renne. as all the variations of 'cl.' from the correct text are given in the foot-notes, it is not necessary to say more about these peculiarities. i must add, however, that, as in boethius, i have silently corrected yn to in in such words as thing ; besides altering ee and oo to e and o in open syllables, writing v for u , and the like. see above. the campsall ms., now in the possession of mr. bacon frank, {lxix} has been printed in full, as written, for the chaucer society; and i have relied upon the accuracy of this well-edited print. 2. ms. cp. —ms. no. 61 in corpus christi college, cambridge, described in nasmith's catalogue, p. 40, as 'a parchment book in folio neatly written, and ornamented with a frontispiece richly illuminated, containing chaucer's troilus, in four [ error for five] books.' it is a fine folio ms., 12 inches by 8½. this ms., noticed by warton, has not as yet been printed, though the chaucer society have undertaken to print it, upon my recommendation. it contains many pages that are left wholly or partially blank, obviously meant to be supplied with illuminations; which shews that it was written for some wealthy person. on the left margin, near the 83rd stanza of book iv, is a note of ownership, in a hand of the fifteenth century—'neu er foryeteth: anne neuyll.' this probably refers to anne neville, wife of humphrey, duke of buckingham (who was killed at northampton in 1460), and daughter of ralph neville, earl of westmoreland, and of joan beaufort, daughter of john of gaunt. that is, she was john of gaunt's granddaughter; and it seems reasonable to infer that the ms. was actually written for one of john of gaunt's family. this probability is a very interesting one, when we consider how much chaucer owed to john of gaunt's favour and protection. the ms. is slightly deficient, owing to the omission of a few stanzas; but not much is missing. it is of a type closely resembling the preceding, and gives excellent readings. i have therefore taken the opportunity of founding the text upon a close collation of cl. and cp., taking cl. as the foundation, but correcting it by cp. throughout, without specifying more than the rejected reading of cl. in passages where these mss. differ. in this way the numerous absurdities of cl. (as noted above) have been easily corrected, and the resulting text is a great improvement upon all that have hitherto appeared. in a few places, as shewn by the foot-notes, the readings of other mss. have been preferred. 3. ms. h. —ms. harl. 2280, in the british museum. an excellent ms., very closely related to both the preceding. printed in full for the chaucer society, and collated throughout in the present edition. it was taken as the basis of the text in morris's aldine edition, which in many passages closely resembles the present text. it is certainly the third best ms. one leaf is missing (bk. v. 1345-1428; twelve stanzas). {lxx} 4. ms. cm. —ms. gg. 4. 27, in the cambridge university library; the same ms. as that denoted by 'cm.' in the foot-notes to the canterbury tales, and by 'c.' in the foot-notes to the legend of good women. a remarkable ms., printed in full for the chaucer society. it exhibits a different type of text from that found in cl., cp., and h. the most noteworthy differences are as follows. in bk. ii. 734, 5, this ms. has quite a different couplet, viz.: men louyn women þ our al þis tou n aboute; be þey þe wers? whi, nay, w i t h -outyn doute. bk. ii. 792 runs thus:— how ofte tyme may men rede and se. bk. iv. 309-15 (stanza 45) runs thus:— what shulde ye don but, for myn disconfort, stondyn for nought, and wepyn out youre ye? syn sche is queynt that wont was yow disport [63] , in vayn from this forth have i seyn twye; for [64] medycyn youre vertu is a-weye; o crewel eyen, sythyn that youre dispyt was al to sen crisseydes eyen bryght. bk. iv. 638 runs thus:— pandare answerde, of that be as be may. after bk. iv. 735, ms. cm. introduces the following stanza, which, in the present text, appears a little later (ll. 750-6) in a slightly altered form. the salte teris fro m hyre eyȝyn tweyn out ran, as scho ur of aprille, ful swythe; hyre white brest sche bet, and for the peyne, aftyr the deth cryede a thousent sithe, syn he that wonyt was hir wo for to lythe, sche mot forgon; for which disauenture sche held hire-selue a for-lost creature. bk. iv. 806-33 (four stanzas) are omitted; so also are the 18 stanzas referring to free-will, viz. bk. iv. 953-1078. bk. v. 230-1 runs thus :— to whom for eu er emor myn herte is holde: and thus he pleynyd, and ferth er e-more he tolde. we cannot believe that bk. iv. 309-15, as here given, can be {lxxi} genuine [65] ; but it seems possible that some of the other readings may be so. the stanza, bk. iv. 750-6, as here given, seems to represent the first draft of these lines, which were afterwards altered to the form in which they appear in the text, whilst at the same time the stanza was shifted down. however, this is mere speculation; and it must be confessed that, in many places, this ms. is strangely corrupted. several stanzas have only six lines instead of seven, and readings occur which set all ideas of rime at defiance. thus, in i. 1260, paste (riming with caste ) appears as passede ; in i. 1253, ryde (riming with aspyde ) appears as rydende ; in iii. 351, hayes (riming with may is ) appears as halis ; &c. yet the ms. is worth collating, as it gives, occasionally, some excellent readings. for example, in bk. i. 143, it preserves the word here , which other mss. wrongly omit; and, in the very next line, rightly has to longe dwelle , not to longe to dwelle . the ms. has been, at some time, shamefully maltreated by some one who has cut out several leaves, no doubt for the sake of their illuminated initials. hence the following passages do not appear: i. 1-70; i. 1037—ii. 84; iii. 1-56; iii. 1807—iv. 112; iv. 1667—v. 35; v. 1702— end ( together with a piece at the beginning of the canterbury tales). 5. ms. h2. —harleian ms. 3943, in the british museum. printed in full for the chaucer society in 1875, together with a most valuable line by line collation with boccaccio's filostrato, by wm. michael rossetti. referred to in prof. lounsbury's studies in chaucer, i. 398, as 'much the worst that has been printed,' where his object is to depreciate its authority. yet it is well worth a careful study, and it must be particularly borne in mind that it consists of two parts, written at different dates, and of different value. in bell's chaucer, we read of it:—'unfortunately it is imperfect. the first few leaves, and the whole of the latter part of the poem, appear to have been destroyed, and the deficiency supplied by a later copyist.' the late hand occurs in i. 1-70, 498-567, iii. 1429-1638, iv. 197— end , and book v.; and thus occupies a large portion of the ms. moreover, two leaves are lost after leaf 59, comprising iii. 1289-1428; these are supplied in dr. furnivall's edition from harl. 1239, which {lxxii} accounts for the extraordinary disorder in which these stanzas are arranged. the ms. also omits iii. 1744-1771, and some other stanzas occasionally. this is one of those curious mss. which, although presenting innumerable corrupt readings (the worst being commodious for commeveden in iii. 17), nevertheless have some points of contact with an excellent source. all editors must have observed a few such cases. thus, in ii. 615, it happily restores the right reading latis , where the ordinary reading gates is ludicrously wrong. in iii. 49, it supplies the missing word gladnes . in v. 8, it has 'the auricomus tressed phebus hie on lofte,' instead of 'the golden tressed'; and this reading, though false, lets us into the secret of the origin of this epithet, viz. that it translates the latin auricomus ; see note to the line. in the very next line, v. 9, it preserves the correct reading bemes shene [66] , riming with grene , quene , where other mss. have bemes clere , a reminiscence of the opening line of book iii. hence i have carefully collated this ms., and all readings of value are given in the notes. see, e. g. iii. 28, 49, 136, 551, 1268, 1703, &c. 6. ms. harl. 1239 (b. m.). 'it is an oblong folio, written from the beginning in a small, clear character, which ceases at an earlier place [iii. 231] than the change occurs in ms. 3943 [iv. 197], leaving the remainder comparatively useless as an authority.'—bell. dr. furnivall has printed the passages in iii. 1289-1428, and iii. 1744-1771, from this ms. to supply the gaps in h 2 (see above); we thus see that it transposes several of the stanzas, and is but a poor authority. 7. ms. harl. 2392 (b. m.). a late ms. on paper, not very correct; once the property of sir h. spelman. as an example of a strange reading, observe 'o mortal gower,' in v. 1856. still, it has the correct reading sheene in v. 9; and in iii. 49, supplies the rare reading gladnesse , which is necessary to the sense. this ms. has a large number of notes and glosses. some are of small interest, but others are of value, and doubtless {lxxiii} proceeded from the author himself, as they furnish useful references and explanations. i here notice the best of them. ii. 8. 'cleo: domina eloquencie.' this view of clio explains the context. ii. 784. side-note: 'nota mendacium.' a remarkable comment. ii. 1238-9. 'leuis impressio, leuis recessio.' clearly, a proverb. iii. 933. 'dulcarnon: i. fuga miserorum.' this proves that chaucer confused the 47th proposition of euclid with the 5th; see note. iii. 1177. 'beati misericordes'; from matt. v. 7. iii. 1183. 'petite et accipi[e]tis'; a remarkable comment. iii. 1415. 'gallus vulgaris astrologus; alanus, de planctu nature'; see note. iii. 1417. 'lucifera: stella matutina.' iii. 1466. 'aurora: amica solis'; shewing the confusion of tithonus with titan . iv. 22. 'herine ( sic ), furie infernales; unde lucanus, me pronuba duxit herinis.' this proves that chaucer really took the name from lucan, phars. viii. 90, q. v. iv. 32. 'sol in leone'; i. e. the sun was in leo; see note. iv. 600. 'audaces fortuna iuuat'; error for 'audentes'; see note. iv. 790. 'vmbra subit terras,' &c.; ovid, met. xi. 61. iv. 836. 'extrema gaudii luctus'; see note. iv. 1138. 'flet tamen, et tepide,' &c.; ovid, met. x. 500. iv. 1504. 'non est bonum perdere substantiam propter accidens.' iv. 1540. 'styx, puteus infernalis.' chaucer's mistake. v. 8. 'the gold-tressed phebus,' glossed 'auricomus sol'; which is from valerius flaccus; see note. v. 319. reference to ovid's metamorphoses; see note. v. 655. 'latona, i. luna'; shewing that 'latona' is mis-written for 'lucina.' cf. iv. 1591. v. 664. reference to ovid, metam. ii. see note. v. 1039. for 'she,' ms. has 'he,' correctly (see note); side-note, 'nota, de donis c. d.', i. e. of criseyde to diomede. v. 1107. 'laurigerus'; see note. v. 1110. 'nisus,' glossed 'rex'; 'douhter,' glossed 'alauda'; see note. {lxxiv} v. 1548. 'parodye: duracio'; see note. v. 1550. 'vnbodye: decorporare.' there are many more such glosses, of lesser interest. 8. ms. harl. 4912 (b. m.). on vellum; rather large pages, with wide margins; five stanzas on the page. imperfect; ends at iv. 686. a poor copy. in iii. 49, it retains the rare reading 'gladnes,' but miswritten as 'glanes.' 9. ms. addit. 12044 (b. m.). on vellum; five stanzas to the page. last leaf gone; ends at v. 1820. not a good copy. in iii. 17, it has 'comeued hem,' an obvious error for 'comeueden,' which is the true reading. in v. 8, it has 'golden dressed,' error for 'golden tressed.' note this correct form 'golden'; for it is miswritten as 'gold' or 'golde' in nearly all other copies. the next four are in the bodleian library, oxford. 10. arch. seld. b. 24 is the scottish ms., dated 1472, described in the introduction to the minor poems, where it is denoted by 'ar.,' and fully collated throughout the legend of good women, where it appears in the foot-notes as 'a.' it seems to be the best of the oxford mss., and has some good readings. in iii. 17, it has 'co m meued tham' for commeueden,' which is near enough for a ms. that so freely drops inflexions; and the line ends with 'and amoreux tham made.' in iii. 49, it correctly preserves 'gladness.' 11. ms. rawlinson, poet. 163. not a very good copy. it omits the prologue to book iii. at the end is the colophon :— 'tregentyll heer endith the book of troylus and of cresseyde chaucer.' i take 'tregentyll' to be the scribe's name [67] . besides the 'troilus,' the ms. contains, on a fly-leaf, the unique copy of the balade to rosemounde, beneath which is written (as in the former case) 'tregentil' to the left of the page, and 'chaucer' to the right; connected by a thin stroke. see my 'twelve facsimiles of old english mss.'; plate xii. 12. ms. arch. seld. supra 56. small quarto, 8 inches by 5½, on paper; vellum binding; writing clear. a poor copy. the grammar shews a northern dialect. {lxxv} 13. ms. digby 181. incomplete; nearly half being lost. it ends at iii. 532—'a certayn houre in which she come sholde.' a poor copy, closely allied to the preceding. thus, in iii. 17, both have moreux for amoreux ; in iii. 2, both have adornes ; in iii. 6, both absurdly have off ( of ) for o ; and so on. 14. ms. l. 1, in st. john's college, cambridge. a fair ms., perhaps earlier than 1450. subjoined to the troilus is a sixteenth century copy of the testament of creseide. quarto; on vellum; 10 inches by 6½; in 10 sheets of 12 leaves each. leaf g 12 is cut out, and g 11 is blank, but nothing seems to be lost. it frequently agrees with cp., as in i. 5, fro ye; 21, be this; 36, desespeyred; 45, fair ladys so; 70, delphicus; 308, kan thus. in i. 272, it correctly has: p er cede; in 337, nou n c er teyne. in ii. 734, it agrees with h.; 735 runs—'and whan hem list no lenger, lat hem leue'; a good line. in ii. 894, it has 'mosten axe,' the very reading which i give; and in ii. 968, stalkes. 15. ms. phillipps 8252; the same ms. as that described in my preface to the c. text of piers the plowman, p. xix, where it is numbered xxviii. 16. a ms. in the library of durham cathedral, marked v. ii. 13. a single stanza of troilus, viz. i. 631-7, occurs in ms. r. 3. 20, in trinity college library, cambridge; and three stanzas, viz. iii. 302-322, in ms. ff. 1. 6, leaf 150, in the cambridge university library; all printed in odd texts of chaucer's minor poems, ed. f. j. furnivall, chaucer society, 1880, pp. x-xii. in 1887, dr. stephens found two vellum strips in the cover of a book, containing fragments of a ms. of troilus (book v. 1443-1498); see appendix to the report of the cambridge antiquarian society, may 24, 1887; pp. 331-5. the mss. fall, as far as i can tell, into two main families. the larger family is that which resembles cl., cp., and h. of the smaller, cm. may be taken as the type. the description of cm. shews some of the chief variations. observe that many mss. omit i. 890-6; in the john's ms., it is inserted in a much later hand. the stanza is obviously genuine. § 26. the editions. 'troilus' was first printed by caxton, about 1484; but without printer's name, place, or date. see the description in blades' life of caxton, p. 297. there is no title-page. each page contains five stanzas. two copies are in the british museum; one at st. john's college, oxford; and one (till {lxxvi} lately) was at althorp. the second edition is by wynkyn de worde, in 1517. the third, by pynson, in 1526. these three editions present troilus as a separate work. after this, it was included in thynne's edition of 1532, and in all the subsequent editions of chaucer's works. of these, the only editions accessible to me have been thynne's (1532), of which there is a copy in the cambridge university library; also the editions of 1550 (or thereabouts) and 1561, of both of which i possess copies. thynne's edition was printed from so good a ms. as to render it an excellent authority. in a few places, i fear he has altered the text for the worse, and his errors have been carefully followed and preserved by succeeding editors. thus he is responsible for altering io (= jo ) into go , iii. 33; for creating the remarkable 'ghost-word' gofysshe , iii. 584; and a few similar curiosities. but i found it worth while to collate it throughout; and readings from it are marked 'ed.' the later black-letter copies are mere reproductions of it. § 27. the present edition. the present edition has the great advantage of being founded upon cl. and cp., neither of which have been previously made use of, though they are the two best. bell's text is founded upon the harleian mss. numbered 1239, 2280, and 3943, in separate fragments; hence the text is neither uniform nor very good. morris's text is much better, being founded upon h. (closely related to cl. and cp.), with a few corrections from other unnamed sources. thanks to the prints provided by the chaucer society, i have been able to produce a text which, i trust, leaves but little to be desired. i point out some of the passages which now appear in a correct form for the first time, as may be seen by comparison with the editions by morris and bell, which i denote by m. and b. i. 136; derre , dearer; m. b. dere (no rime). 285. meninge , i. e. intention; and so in l. 289; m. b. mevynge. 388. m. b. insert a semicolon after arten . 465. fownes (see note); m. b. fantasye (line too long). 470 felle , fell, pl. adj.;

knotles for knotteles in v. 769, &c. i have also, for the first time, numbered the lines and stanzas correctly. in m., books iii. and iv. are both misnumbered, causing much trouble in reference. dr. furnivall's print of the campsall ms. omits i. 890-6; and his print of ms. harl. 3943 counts in the latin lines here printed at p. 404 . § 28. it is worth notice that troilus contains about fifty lines {lxxviii} in which the first foot consists of a single syllable. examples in book i are :— that | the hot-e fyr of lov' him brende: 490. lov' | ayeins the which who-so defendeth: 603. twen | ty winter that his lady wiste: 811. wer' | it for my suster, al thy sorwe: 860. next | the foule netle, rough and thikke: 948. now | pandar', i can no mor-e seye: 1051. al | derfirst his purpos for to winne: 1069. so also ii. 369, 677, 934, 1034, 1623 (and probably 1687); iii. 412, 526, 662, 855 (perhaps 1552), 1570; iv. 176, 601, 716, 842, 1328, 1676; v. 67 (perhaps 311), 334, 402, 802, 823, 825, 831, 880, 887, 949, 950, 1083, 1094, 1151, 1379, 1446, 1454, 1468, 1524. it thus appears that deficient lines of this character are by no means confined to the poems in 'heroic verse,' but occur in stanzas as well. compare the parlement of foules, 445, 569. § 29. proverbs. troilus contains a considerable number of proverbs and proverbial phrases or similes. see, e. g., i. 257, 300, 631, 638, 694, 708, 731, 740, 946-952, 960, 964, 1002, 1024;

v. 484, 505, 784, 899, 971, 1174, 1265, 1433. § 30. a translation of the first two books of troilus into latin verse, by sir francis kinaston, was printed at oxford in 1635. the volume also contains a few notes, but i do not find in them anything of value. the author tries to reproduce the english stanza, as thus :— 'dolorem troili duplicem narrare, qui priami regis trojae fuit gnatus, vt primùm illi contigit amare, vt miser, felix, et infortunatus erat, decessum ante sum conatus. tisiphone, fer opem recensere hos versus, qui, dum scribo, visi flere.' for myself, i prefer the english. § 31. hazlitt's handbook to popular literature records the following title:—'a paraphrase vpon the 3 first bookes of chaucer's troilus and cressida. translated into modern english ... by j[onathan] s[idnam]. about 1630. folio;

and eek, 20 the same plato livinge, his maister socrates deservede victorie of {7} unrightful deeth in my presence. the heritage of which socrates— the heritage is to seyn the doctrine of the whiche socrates in his opinioun of felicitee, that i clepe welefulnesse —whan that the poeple of epicuriens and stoiciens and many othre enforceden 25 hem to go ravisshe everich man for his part— that is to seyn, that everich of hem wolde drawen to the defence of his opinioun the wordes of socrates —they, as in partie of hir preye, to-drowen me, cryinge and debatinge ther-ayeins, and corven and to-renten my clothes that i hadde woven with myn handes; and with tho 30 cloutes that they hadden araced out of my clothes they wenten awey, weninge that i hadde gon with hem everydel. in whiche epicuriens and stoiciens , for as moche as ther semede some traces or steppes of myn habite, the folye of men, weninge tho epicuriens and stoiciens my famuleres, perverted ( sc. persequendo ) 35 some through the errour of the wikkede or uncunninge multitude of hem. this is to seyn that, for they semede philosophres, they weren pursued to the deeth and slayn. so yif thou hast nat knowen the exilinge of anaxogore , ne the enpoysoninge of socrates, ne the tourments of zeno , for they weren straungeres: 40 yit mightestow han knowen the senecciens and the canios and the sorans , of whiche folk the renoun is neither over-olde ne unsolempne the whiche men, no-thing elles ne broughte hem to the deeth but only for they weren enfourmed of myne maneres, and semeden most unlyke to the studies of wikkede folk. and 45 forthy thou oughtest nat to wondren though that i, in the bittre see of this lyf, be fordriven with tempestes blowinge aboute, in the whiche tempestes this is my most purpos, that is to seyn , to displesen to wikkede men. of whiche shrewes, al be the ost never so greet, it is to dispyse ; for it nis governed with no leder 50 of resoun, but it is ravisshed only by fletinge errour folyly and lightly. and if they som-tyme, makinge an ost ayeins us, assaile us as strenger, our leder draweth to-gidere hise richesses in-to his tour, and they ben ententif aboute sarpulers or sachels unprofitable {8} for to taken. but we that ben heye aboven, siker fro alle 55 tumulte and wode noise, warnestored and enclosed in swich a palis , whider as that chateringe or anoyinge folye ne may nat atayne, we scorne swiche ravineres and henteres of fouleste thinges. pr. iii. 3. c. fesissien; a. fyciscien; ed. phisycien. // c. fastnede; a. festned. 4. lat. respicio . 6. c. vertuus; a. vertues. 7. c. artow; a. art thou. 13. a. om. thing. 14. c. compaygnie; a. compaignie. 16. c. trowestow; a. trowest thou. 20. c. desseruede; a. deserued. 21. c. eritage; a. heritage. 25. c. rauysse; a. rauische. 26. c. deffence; a. defence. 30. c. arraced; a. arased. 31. c. om. i. 33. c. or; a. and. 34. a. familers. 36. a. om. that. 38. c. om. 1st of. 40. c. myhtestow; a. myȝtest thou. // c. senecciens; a. senectiens; ed. senecas. 43. c. enformyd; a. vnfourmed. 44. c. vnlyk; a. vnlyke. 48. c. oost, glossed i. acies. 50. c. rauyssed; a. rauysched. // c. folyly, i. sine consilio. 52. a. hys rycchesse. 53. c. sarpuleris; a. sarpulers. 55. c. tumolte; a. tumulte. // a. stored. 56. c. palis; a. palays (lat. uallo ). // c. om. that. // c. anoyenge; a. anoying. 57 c. atayne; a. attayne. // c. schorne; a. scorne. metre iv. quisquis composito serenus euo. who-so it be that is cleer of vertu, sad, and wel ordinat of livinge, that hath put under foot the proude werdes and looketh upright up-on either fortune , he may holde his chere undiscomfited. the rage ne the manaces of the see, commoevinge or 5 chasinge upward hete fro the botme, ne shal not moeve that man; ne the unstable mountaigne that highte vesevus , that wrytheth out through his brokene chiminees smokinge fyres. ne the wey of thonder-light , that is wont to smyten heye toures, ne shal nat moeve that man. wher-to thanne, o wrecches, drede ye 10 tirauntes that ben wode and felonous with-oute any strengthe?

( quasi diceret, nichil ). hath my studie and my cunninge deserved thus; or elles the forseide dampnacioun of me , made that hem rightful accusers or no? ( quasi diceret, non ). was not fortune ashamed of this? certes, al hadde nat fortune ben ashamed that innocence was accused, yit 100 oughte she han had shame of the filthe of myne accusours. but, axestow in somme , of what gilt i am accused, men seyn that i wolde save the companye of the senatours. and desirest thou to heren in what manere? i am accused that i sholde han destourbed the accuser to beren lettres, by whiche he sholde han 105 maked the senatoures gilty ayeins the kinges real maiestee. o maistresse, what demestow of this? shal i forsake this blame, that i ne be no shame to thee? ( quasi diceret, non ). certes, i have wold it, that is to seyn, the savacioun of the senat , ne i shal never leten to wilne it, and that i confesse and am aknowe; but the 110 entente of the accuser to be destourbed shal cese. for shal i clepe it thanne a felonie or a sinne that i have desired the savacioun of the ordre of the senat? ( quasi diceret, dubito quid ). and certes yit hadde thilke same senat don by me , thorugh hir decrets and hir iugements, as though it were a sinne or a felonie; 115 that is to seyn, to wilne the savacioun of hem ( sc. senatus ). but folye, that lyeth alwey to him-self, may not chaunge the merite of thinges. ne i trowe nat, by the iugement of socrates , that it were leveful to me to hyde the sothe, ne assente to lesinges. but certes, how so ever it be of this, i putte it to gessen or 120 preisen to the iugement of thee and of wyse folk. of whiche thing al the ordinaunce and the sothe, for as moche as folk that ben to comen after our dayes shullen knowen it, i have put it in scripture and in remembraunce. for touching the lettres falsly maked, by whiche lettres i am accused to han hoped the fredom 125 of rome, what aperteneth me to speke ther-of? of whiche lettres the fraude hadde ben shewed apertly, yif i hadde had libertee for to han used and ben at the confessioun of myne {13} accusours, the whiche thing in alle nedes hath greet strengthe. for what other fredom may men hopen? certes, i wolde that 130 som other fredom mighte ben hoped. i wolde thanne han answered by the wordes of a man that highte canius ; for whan he was accused by gaius cesar, germeynes sone , that he ( canius ) was knowinge and consentinge of a coniuracioun y-maked ayeins him ( sc. gaius ), this canius answerede thus: 135 "yif i hadde wist it, thou haddest nat wist it." in which thing sorwe hath nat so dulled my wit, that i pleyne only that shrewede folk aparailen felonies ayeins vertu; but i wondre greetly how that they may performe thinges that they hadde hoped for to don. for-why, to wilne shrewednesse, that comth peraventure 140 of oure defaute; but it is lyk a monstre and a mervaille, how that, in the present sighte of god, may ben acheved and performed swiche thinges as every felonous man hath conceived in his thought ayeins innocents. for which thing oon of thy famileres nat unskilfully axed thus: "yif god is, whennes comen wikkede 145 thinges? and yif god ne is, whennes comen gode thinges?" but al hadde it ben leveful that felonous folk, that now desiren the blood and the deeth of alle gode men and eek of alle the senat, han wilned to gon destroyen me, whom they han seyen alwey batailen and defenden gode men and eek al the senat, 150 yit had i nat desserved of the faderes, that is to seyn, of the senatoures , that they sholden wilne my destruccioun. thou remembrest wel, as i gesse, that whan i wolde doon or seyen any thing, thou thyself, alwey present, rewledest me. at the city of verone , whan that the king, gredy of comune slaughter, 155 caste him to transporten up al the ordre of the senat the gilt of his real maiestee , of the whiche gilt that albin was accused, with how gret sikernesse of peril to me defendede i al the senat! thou wost wel that i seye sooth, ne i ne avauntede me never in preysinge of my-self. for alwey, whan any wight receiveth 160 precious renoun in avauntinge him-self of his werkes, he amenuseth the secree of his conscience. but now thou mayst wel seen to {14} what ende i am comen for myne innocence; i receive peyne of fals felonye for guerdon of verray vertu. and what open confessioun of felonye hadde ever iuges so acordaunt in crueltee, 165 that is to seyn, as myn accusinge hath , that either errour of mannes wit or elles condicioun of fortune, that is uncertein to alle mortal folk, ne submittede some of hem, that is to seyn, that it ne enclynede som iuge to han pitee or compassioun ? for al-thogh i hadde ben accused that i wolde brenne holy houses, and strangle preestes 170 with wikkede swerde, or that i hadde greythed deeth to al gode men, algates the sentence sholde han punisshed me, present , confessed, or convict. but now i am remewed fro the citee of rome almost fyve hundred thousand pas , i am with-oute defence dampned to proscripcioun and to the deeth, for the studie and 175 bountees that i have doon to the senat. but o, wel ben they worthy of merite ( as who seith, nay ), ther mighte never yit non of hem be convict of swiche a blame as myne is! of whiche trespas, myne accusours sayen ful wel the dignitee; the whiche dignitee, for they wolden derken it with medeling of som felonye, 180 they baren me on hand, and lyeden, that i hadde polut and defouled my conscience with sacrilege , for coveitise of dignitee. and certes, thou thy-self, that are plaunted in me, chacedest out of the sege of my corage al coveitise of mortal thinges; ne sacrilege hadde no leve to han a place in me biforn thyne eyen. 185 for thou droppedest every day in myne eres and in my thought thilke comaundement of pictagoras , that is to seyn , men shal serve to godde, and not to goddes . ne it was nat convenient, ne no nede , to taken help of the foulest spirites; i , that thou hast ordeined and set in swiche excellence that thou makedest 190 me lyk to god. and over this, the right clene secree chaumbre of myne hous, that is to seyn, my wyf , and the companye of myn honest freendes, and my wyves fader, as wel holy as worthy {15} to ben reverenced thorugh his owne dedes, defenden me from alle suspecioun of swich blame. but o malice! for they that 195 accusen me taken of thee, philosophie , feith of so gret blame! for they trowen that i have had affinitee to malefice or enchauntement , by-cause that i am replenisshed and fulfilled with thy techinges, and enformed of thy maneres. and thus it suffiseth not only, that thy reverence ne availe me not, but-yif that thou, 200 of thy free wille, rather be blemished with myn offencioun. but certes, to the harmes that i have, ther bitydeth yit this encrees of harm, that the gessinge and the iugement of moche folk ne looken no-thing to the desertes of thinges, but only to the aventure of fortune; and iugen that only swiche thinges 205 ben purveyed of god, whiche that temporel welefulnesse commendeth. glose. as thus: that, yif a wight have prosperitee, he is a good man and worthy to han that prosperitee; and who-so hath adversitee, he is a wikked man, and god hath forsake him, and 210 he is worthy to han that adversitee. this is the opinioun of some folk. and ther-of comth that good gessinge , first of alle thing, forsaketh wrecches: certes, it greveth me to thinke right now the dyverse sentences that the poeple seith of me. and thus moche 215 i seye, that the laste charge of contrarious fortune is this: that, whan that any blame is leyd upon a caitif, men wenen that he hath deserved that he suffreth. and i, that am put awey fro gode men, and despoiled of dignitees, and defouled of my name by gessinge , have suffred torment for my gode dedes. certes, 220 me semeth that i see the felonous covines of wikked men habounden in ioye and in gladnesse. and i see that every lorel shapeth him to finde out newe fraudes for to accuse gode folk. and i see that gode men beth overthrowen for drede of my peril; and every luxurious tourmentour dar doon alle 225 felonye unpunisshed and ben excited therto by yiftes; and innocents ne ben not only despoiled of sikernesse but of defence; and therfore me list to cryen to god in this wyse:— {16} pr. iv. 1. c. felistow;

95 errour and folye confoundeth yow. i shal shewe thee shortely the poynt of sovereyne blisfulnesse. is ther any-thing more precious to thee than thy-self? thou wolt answere, "nay." thanne, yif it so be that thou art mighty over thy-self, that is to seyn, by tranquillitee of thy sowle , than hast 100 thou thing in thy power that thou noldest never lesen, ne fortune ne may nat beneme it thee. and that thou mayst knowe that blisfulnesse ne may nat standen in thinges that ben fortunous and temporel, now understonde and gader it to-gidere thus: yif blisfulnesse be the sovereyn good of nature that liveth by 105 resoun, ne thilke thing nis nat sovereyn good that may be taken awey in any wyse, (for more worthy thing and more digne is thilke thing that may nat ben taken awey); than sheweth it wel , that the unstablenesse of fortune may nat atayne to receiven verray blisfulnesse. and yit more-over: what man that this 110 toumbling welefulnesse ledeth, either he woot that it is chaungeable, or elles he woot it nat. and yif he woot it nat, what blisful fortune may ther be in the blindnesse of ignorance? and yif he woot that it is chaungeable, he moot alwey ben adrad that he ne lese that thing that he ne doubteth nat but that he may lesen it; 115 as who seith, he mot ben alwey agast, lest he lese that he wot wel he may lese it . for which, the continuel dreed that he hath ne suffreth him nat to ben weleful. or yif he lese it, he weneth to be dispysed and forleten. certes eek, that is a ful litel good that is born with evene herte whan it is lost; that is to seyn, that men 120 do no more fors of the lost than of the havinge . and for as moche as thou thy-self art he, to whom it hath ben shewed and proved by ful manye demonstraciouns, as i wot wel, that the sowles of men ne mowe nat deyen in no wyse; and eek sin it is cleer and certein, that fortunous welefulnesse endeth by the deeth of the 125 {36} body; it may nat ben douted that, yif that deeth may take awey blisfulnesse, that alle the kinde of mortal thinges ne descendeth in-to wrecchednesse by the ende of the deeth. and sin we knowen wel, that many a man hath sought the fruit of blisfulnesse nat only with suffringe of deeth, but eek with suffringe of peynes and 130 tormentes; how mighte than this present lyf maken men blisful, sin that, whan thilke selve lyf is ended, it ne maketh folk no wrecches?

why art thou ravisshed with 50 ydel ioyes? why embracest thou straunge goodes as they weren thyne? fortune ne shal never maken that swiche thinges ben thyne, that nature of thinges hath maked foreine fro thee. sooth is that, with-outen doute, the frutes of the erthe owen to ben to the norissinge of bestes. and yif thou wolt fulfille thy nede after 55 that it suffyseth to nature, than is it no nede that thou seke after the superfluitee of fortune. for with ful fewe things and with ful litel thinges nature halt hir apayed; and yif thou wolt achoken the fulfillinge of nature with superfluitees, certes, thilke thinges that thou wolt thresten or pouren in-to nature shullen ben unioyful 60 to thee, or elles anoyous. wenest thou eek that it be a fair thing to shyne with dyverse clothinge? of whiche clothinge yif the beautee be agreeable to loken up-on, i wol mervailen on the nature of the matere of thilke clothes, or elles on the werkman that wroughte hem. but also a long route of meynee, maketh 65 that a blisful man? the whiche servants, yif they ben vicious of condiciouns, it is a great charge and a distruccioun to the hous, and a greet enemy to the lord him-self. and yif they ben goode men, how shal straunge or foreine goodnesse ben put in the noumbre of thy richesse? so that, by all these forseide thinges, 70 it is clearly y-shewed, that never oon of thilke thinges that thou acountedest for thyne goodes nas nat thy good. in the whiche {39} thinges, yif ther be no beautee to ben desyred, why sholdest thou ben sory yif thou lese hem, or why sholdest thou reioysen thee to holden hem? for yif they ben faire of hir owne kinde, what 75 aperteneth that to thee? for al so wel sholden they han ben faire by hem-selve, though they weren departed fram alle thyne richesses. forwhy faire ne precious ne weren they nat, for that they comen among thy richesses; but, for they semeden faire and precious, ther-for thou haddest lever rekne hem amonges thy 80 richesses. but what desirest thou of fortune with so grete a noise, and with so grete a fare? i trowe thou seke to dryve awey nede with habundaunce of thinges; but certes, it torneth to you al in the contrarie. forwhy certes, it nedeth of ful manye helpinges to 85 kepen the diversitee of precious ostelments . and sooth it is, that of manye thinges han they nede that manye thinges han; and ayeinward, of litel nedeth hem that mesuren hir fille after the nede of kinde, and nat after the outrage of coveityse. is it thanne so, that ye men ne han no proper good y-set in you, for which 90 ye moten seken outward youre goodes in foreine and subgit thinges? so is thanne the condicioun of thinges torned up-so-down, that a man, that is a devyne beest by merite of his resoun, thinketh that him-self nis neither faire ne noble, but-yif it be thorugh possessioun of ostelments that ne han no sowles. and 95 certes, al other thinges ben apayed of hir owne beautee; but ye men, that ben semblable to god by your resonable thought, desiren to aparailen your excellent kinde of the lowest thinges; ne ye understonden nat how greet a wrong ye don to your creatour. for he wolde that mankinde were most worthy and 100 noble of any othre erthely thinges; and ye threste adoun your dignitees benethe the lowest thinges. for yif that al the good of every thinge be more precious than is thilke thing whos that the good is: sin ye demen that the fouleste thinges ben youre goodes, thanne submitten ye and putten your-selven under tho 105 fouleste thinges by your estimacioun; and certes , this tydeth nat with-oute youre desertes. for certes, swiche is the condicioun of alle mankinde, that only whan it hath knowinge of it-selve, than {40} passeth it in noblesse alle other thinges; and whan it forleteth the knowinge of it-self, than is it brought binethen alle beestes. for-why 110 al other livinge beestes han of kinde to knowe nat hem-self; but whan that men leten the knowinge of hemself, it cometh hem of vice. but how brode sheweth the errour and the folye of yow men, that wenen that any thing may ben aparailed with straunge aparailements! but for sothe that may nat ben doon. for yif 115 a wight shyneth with thinges that ben put to him, as thus, if thilke thinges shynen with which a man is aparailed , certes, thilke thinges ben comended and preysed with which he is aparailed; but natheles, the thing that is covered and wrapped under that dwelleth in his filthe. 120 and i denye that thilke thing be good that anoyeth him that hath it. gabbe i of this?

and therfor it is thus, that honour ne comth nat to vertu for cause of dignitee, but ayeinward honour comth to dignitee for cause of vertu. but whiche is thilke youre dereworthe power, 20 that is so cleer and so requerable ? o ye ertheliche bestes, considere ye nat over which thinge that it semeth that ye han power? now yif thou saye a mous amonges other mys, that chalaunged to him-self-ward right and power over alle other mys, how greet scorn woldest thou han of it! glosa. so fareth it by 25 men; the body hath power over the body. for yif thou loke wel up-on the body of a wight, what thing shall thou finde more freele than is mankinde; the whiche men wel ofte ben slayn with bytinge of smale flyes, or elles with the entringe of crepinge wormes in-to the privetees of mannes body ? but wher shal man 30 finden any man that may exercen or haunten any right up-on another man, but only up-on his body, or elles up-on thinges that ben lowere than the body, the whiche i clepe fortunous possessiouns? mayst thou ever have any comaundement over a free corage? mayst thou remuen fro the estat of his propre 35 reste a thought that is clyvinge to-gidere in him-self by stedefast {43} resoun? as whylom a tyraunt wende to confounde a free man of corage, and wende to constreyne him by torment, to maken him discoveren and acusen folk that wisten of a coniuracioun, which i clepe a confederacie , that was cast ayeins this tyraunt; 40 but this free man boot of his owne tonge and caste it in the visage of thilke wode tyraunt; so that the torments that this tyraunt wende to han maked matere of crueltee, this wyse man maked it matere of vertu. but what thing is it that a man may don to another man, that 45 he ne may receyven the same thing of othre folk in him-self: or thus, what may a man don to folk, that folk ne may don him the same? i have herd told of busirides , that was wont to sleen his gestes that herberweden in his hous; and he was sleyn him-self of ercules that was his gest. regulus hadde taken in bataile 50 many men of affrike and cast hem in-to feteres; but sone after he moste yeve his handes to ben bounde with the cheynes of hem that he hadde whylom overcomen. wenest thou thanne that he be mighty, that hath no power to don a thing, that othre ne may don in him that he doth in othre? and yit more-over, 55 yif it so were that thise dignitees or poweres hadden any propre or natural goodnesse in hem-self, never nolden they comen to shrewes. for contrarious thinges ne ben nat wont to ben y-felawshiped to-gidere. nature refuseth that contrarious thinges ben y-ioigned. and so, as i am in certein that right wikked folk 60 han dignitees ofte tyme, than sheweth it wel that dignitees and powers ne ben nat goode of hir owne kinde; sin that they suffren hem-self to cleven or ioinen hem to shrewes. and certes, the same thing may i most digneliche iugen and seyn of alle the yiftes of fortune that most plentevously comen to shrewes; of 65 the whiche yiftes, i trowe that it oughte ben considered, that no man douteth that he nis strong in whom he seeth strengthe; and in whom that swiftnesse is, sooth it is that he is swift. also musike maketh musiciens, and phisike maketh phisiciens, and rethorike rethoriens. for-why the nature of every thing maketh 70 his propretee, ne it is nat entremedled with the effects of the {44} contrarious thinges; and, as of wil , it chaseth out thinges that ben to it contrarie. but certes, richesse may not restreyne avarice unstaunched; ne power ne maketh nat a man mighty over him-self, whiche that vicious lustes holden destreyned with 75 cheynes that ne mowen nat be unbounden. and dignitees that ben yeven to shrewede folk nat only ne maketh hem nat digne, but it sheweth rather al openly that they ben unworthy and undigne. and why is it thus? certes, for ye han ioye to clepen thinges with false names that beren hem alle in the contrarie; 80 the whiche names ben ful ofte reproeved by the effecte of the same thinges; so that thise ilke richesses ne oughten nat by right to ben cleped richesses; ne swich power ne oughte nat ben cleped power; ne swich dignitee ne oughte nat ben cleped dignitee. 85 and at the laste, i may conclude the same thing of alle the yiftes of fortune, in which ther nis nothing to ben desired, ne that hath in him-self naturel bountee, as it is ful wel y-sene. for neither they ne ioignen hem nat alwey to goode men, ne maken hem alwey goode to whom that they ben y-ioigned. pr. vi. 1. a. seyne. 2. a. om. ye. 5. c. flawmbe; a. fla m me ( twice ). 6. a. ins. wit (!) bef. walweth. 7. c. crwel. // c. remenbryth. 8. a. thilke; c. thikke. // a. emperie; c. imp er iye. 11. a. conseilers. 13. a. kyng; c. kynge. 15. ed. selde; c. a. zelde. // c. a. ed. thinges; read thing (lat. quid placet ). 19. a. om. thilke. 22. c. musȝ; a. myse; ed. myce. 23. c. mysȝ; a. myse; ed. myce. 26. c. shalthow. 27. a. mannes kynde. // a. whiche ben ful ofte slayn. 29. a. mennes bodyes. 33. c. maysthow. 34. c. maysthow remwen. 35. a. cleuyng. // c. stidefast; a. stedfast. 40. ed. caste; c. a. cast. 42. c. crwelte. 45. c. resseyuen; a. receyue. 48. a. herburghden. 52. c. om. he. // c. whylom; a. somtyme. // c. weenesthow. 53. c. thinge; a. thing. 54. a. om. 1st in. // a. to ( for 2nd in). 63. ed. i ( after may); c. a. omit . 67. c. om. it. 68. so a.; c. musuciens, phisissiens. 70. a. effect is ; c. effect. // a. om. the. 72. c. a. to it ben. 73. a. om. 2nd ne. 81, 82. a. rycchesse ( twice ). 82, 83. a. whiche ( for swich; twice ). 87. c. i-seene; a. sene. metre vi. nouimus quantas dederit ruinas. we han wel knowen how many grete harmes and destrucciouns weren don by the emperor nero . he leet brenne the citee of rome, and made sleen the senatoures. and he, cruel, whylom slew his brother ; and he was maked moist with the blood of 5 his moder; that is to seyn, he leet sleen and slitten the body of his moder, to seen wher he was conceived ; and he loked on every halve up-on her colde dede body, ne no tere ne wette his face, but he was so hard-herted that he mighte ben domes-man or iuge of hir dede beautee. and natheles, yit governede this nero by 10 ceptre alle the poeples that phebus the sonne may seen, cominge {45} from his outereste arysinge til he hyde his bemes under the wawes; that is to seyn, he governed alle the poeples by ceptre imperial that the sonne goth aboute, from est to west . and eek this nero governed by ceptre alle the poeples that ben under the 15 colde sterres that highten "septem triones" ; this is to seyn, he governede alle the poeples that ben under the party of the north . and eek nero governed alle the poeples that the violent wind nothus scorkleth, and baketh the brenning sandes by his drye hete; that is to seyn, alle the poeples in the south . but yit ne 20 mighte nat al his hye power torne the woodnesse of this wikked nero. allas! it is a grevous fortune, as ofte as wikked swerd is ioigned to cruel venim; that is to seyn, venimous crueltee to lordshippe .' me. vi. 2. c. let; a. letee (!). 3. c. crwel. // c. whylom; a. somtyme. 5. c. lette ( wrongly ); a. let. 6. c. conseyued; a. conceiued. 7. a. half. // c. wecte; a. wette. 9. a. ȝitte neuertheles. 11. a. hidde. 12. c. sceptre; a. ceptre. 15. c. vii. tyryones ( sic ); a. the seuene triones; ed. the septentrions. 16. a. parties. 18. c. ed. scorklith; a. scorchith. 19-21. a. om. but yit ... nero; ed. retains it, omitting hye. // for allas ... it is, a. has —but ne how greuous fortune is; c. om. a bef. greuous, but ed. retains it . c. repeats it is. 22. c. crwel; crwelte. prose vii. tum ego, scis, inquam. thanne seyde i thus: 'thou wost wel thy-self that the coveitise of mortal thinges ne hadde never lordshipe of me; but i have wel desired matere of thinges to done, as who seith, i desire to han matere of governaunce over comunalitees , for vertu, 5 stille, ne sholde nat elden;' that is to seyn, that [him] leste that, or he wex olde, his vertu, that lay now ful stille, ne should nat perisshe unexercised in governaunce of comune; for which men mighten speken or wryten of his goode governement . philosophye.

but your glorie, that is so narwe and so streite y-throngen in-to so litel boundes, how mochel coveiteth it in largesse and in greet doinge? and also sette this there-to: that many a nacioun, 35 dyverse of tonge and of maneres and eek of resoun of hir livinge, ben enhabited in the clos of thilke litel habitacle; to the whiche naciouns, what for difficultee of weyes and what for dyversitee of langages, and what for defaute of unusage and entrecomuninge of marchaundise, nat only the names of singuler men ne may nat 40 strecchen, but eek the fame of citees ne may nat strecchen. at the laste, certes, in the tyme of marcus tullius , as him-self writ in his book, that the renoun of the comune of rome ne hadde nat yit passed ne cloumben over the mountaigne that highte caucasus ; and yit was, thilke tyme, rome wel waxen and greetly redouted of 45 the parthes and eek of other folk enhabitinge aboute. seestow nat thanne how streit and how compressed is thilke glorie that ye travailen aboute to shewe and to multiplye?

and hasten {54} hem to geten glorious name by the arts of werre and of pees. and many folk mesuren and gessen that sovereyn good be ioye and gladnesse, and wenen that it be right blisful thing to ploungen 30 hem in voluptuous delyt. and ther ben folk that entrechaungen the causes and the endes of thise forseyde goodes, as they that desiren richesses to han power and delytes; or elles they desiren power for to han moneye, or for cause of renoun. in thise thinges, and in swiche othre thinges, is torned alle the entencioun of 35 desiringes and of werkes of men; as thus: noblesse and favour of people, whiche that yeveth to men, as it semeth hem, a maner cleernesse of renoun; and wyf and children, that men desiren for cause of delyt and of merinesse . but forsothe, frendes ne sholden nat be rekned a-mong the godes of fortune, but of vertu; for it is 40 a ful holy maner thing. alle thise othre thinges, forsothe, ben taken for cause of power or elles for cause of delyt. certes, now am i redy to referren the goodes of the body to thise forseide thinges aboven; for it semeth that strengthe and gretnesse of body yeven power and worthinesse, and that beautee 45 and swiftnesse yeven noblesses and glorie of renoun; and hele of body semeth yeven delyt. in alle thise thinges it semeth only that blisfulnesse is desired. for-why thilke thing that every man desireth most over alle thinges, he demeth that it be the sovereyn good; but i have defyned that blisfulnesse is the sovereyn good; 50 for which every wight demeth, that thilke estat that he desireth over alle thinges, that it be blisfulnesse. now hast thou thanne biforn thyn eyen almest al the purposed forme of the welefulnesse of man-kinde, that is to seyn, richesses, honours, power, and glorie, and delyts. the whiche delyt only 55 considerede epicurus , and iuged and establisshed that delyt is the sovereyn good; for as moche as alle othre thinges, as him thoughte, bi-refte awey ioye and mirthe fram the herte. but i retorne ayein to the studies of men, of whiche men the corage alwey reherseth and seketh the sovereyn good, al be it so that 60 it be with a derked memorie; but he not by whiche path, right {55} as a dronken man not nat by whiche path he may retorne him to his hous. semeth it thanne that folk folyen and erren that enforcen hem to have nede of nothing? certes, ther nis non other thing that may so wel performe blisfulnesse, as an estat plentivous 65 of alle goodes, that ne hath nede of non other thing, but that is suffisaunt of himself unto him-self. and folyen swiche folk thanne, that wenen that thilke thing that is right good, that it be eek right worthy of honour and of reverence? certes, nay. for that thing nis neither foul ne worthy to ben despised, that wel neigh al the 70 entencioun of mortal folk travaylen for to geten it. and power, oughte nat that eek to ben rekened amonges goodes? what elles? for it is nat to wene that thilke thing, that is most worthy of alle thinges, be feble and with-oute strengthe. and cleernesse of renoun, oughte that to ben despised? certes, ther may no 75 man forsake , that al thing that is right excellent and noble, that it ne semeth to ben right cleer and renomed. for certes, it nedeth nat to seye, that blisfulnesse be [nat] anguissous ne drery, ne subgit to grevaunces ne to sorwes, sin that in right litel thinges folk seken to have and to usen that may delyten hem. certes, thise ben 80 the thinges that men wolen and desiren to geten. and for this cause desiren they richesses, dignitees, regnes, glorie, and delices. for therby wenen they to han suffisaunce, honour, power, renoun, and gladnesse. than is it good , that men seken thus by so many diverse studies. in whiche desyr it may lightly ben shewed how 85 gret is the strengthe of nature; for how so that men han diverse sentences and discordinge, algates men acorden alle in lovinge the ende of good. pr. ii. 2. c. cyte; a. sete; lat. sedem . 5. c. enforsen; a. enforced; ed. enforcen. 6. a. om. and blisfulnesse. 10. a. om. cleped. 14. c. enforsen;

but yit, al be it so that the reaumes of mankinde strecchen brode, yit mot ther nede ben moche folk, over whiche that every king ne hath no lordshipe ne comaundement. and certes, up-on thilke syde that power faileth, which that maketh folk blisful, right on that same syde noun-power entreth 15 under-nethe, that maketh hem wrecches; in this manere thanne moten kinges han more porcioun of wrecchednesse than of welefulnesse. a tyraunt , that was king of sisile , that hadde assayed the peril of his estat, shewede by similitude the dredes of reaumes by gastnesse of a swerd that heng over the heved 20 of his familier . what thing is thanne this power, that may nat don awey the bytinges of bisinesse, ne eschewe the prikkes of drede?

'who-so that ever,' quod i, 'douteth of this, he ne may nat considere the nature of thinges ne the consequence of resouns.' and over this quod she, 'yif that ther be two thinges that 65 han oo same purpose by kinde, and that oon of hem pursueth and parformeth thilke same thing by naturel office, and that other ne may nat doon thilke naturel office, but folweth, by other manere thanne is convenable to nature, him that acomplissheth his purpos kindely, and yit he ne acomplissheth nat his owne 70 purpos: whether of thise two demestow for more mighty?' ' yif that i coniecte,' quod i, 'that thou wolt seye, algates yit i desire to herkne it more pleynly of thee.' 'thou wilt nat thanne deneye,' quod she, 'that the moevement of goinge nis in men by kinde?' 75 'no, forsothe,' quod i.

'thanne,' quod she, 'yif that a wight be mighty to moeve and 80 goth upon his feet, and another, to whom thilke naturel office of feet lakketh, enforceth him to gon crepinge up-on his handes: whiche of thise two oughte to ben holden the more mighty by right?' ' knit forth the remenaunt,' quod i; 'for no wight ne douteth 85 that he that may gon by naturel office of feet ne be more mighty than he that ne may nat.' 'but the soverein good,' quod she, 'that is eveneliche purposed to the gode folk and to badde, the gode folk seken it by naturel office of vertues, and the shrewes enforcen hem to geten it by 90 {98} dyverse coveityse of erthely thinges , which that nis no naturel office to geten thilke same soverein good. trowestow that it be any other wyse?' 'nay,' quod i; 'for the consequence is open and shewinge of thinges that i have graunted; that nedes gode folk moten ben 95 mighty, and shrewes feeble and unmighty.' 'thou rennest a-right biforn me,' quod she, 'and this is the iugement ; that is to seyn, i iuge of thee right as thise leches ben wont to hopen of syke folk, whan they aperceyven that nature is redressed and withstondeth to the maladye. but, for i see thee 100 now al redy to the understondinge, i shal shewe thee more thikke and continuel resouns. for loke now how greetly sheweth the feblesse and infirmitee of wikkede folk, that ne mowen nat comen to that hir naturel entencioun ledeth hem , and yit almost thilke naturel entencioun constreineth hem. and what were to demen 105 thanne of shrewes , yif thilke naturel help hadde forleten hem, the which naturel help of intencioun goth awey biforn hem, and is so greet that unnethe it may ben overcome? consider thanne how greet defaute of power and how greet feblesse ther is in wikkede felonous folk; as who seyth, the gretter thing that is coveited and 110 the desire nat acomplisshed, of the lasse might is he that coveiteth it and may nat acomplisshe. and forthy philosophie seyth thus by soverein good : ne shrewes ne requeren nat lighte medes ne veyne games, whiche they ne may folwen ne holden; but they failen of thilke somme and of the heighte of thinges, that is to seyn, soverein 115 good ; ne thise wrecches ne comen nat to the effect of soverein good , the which they enforcen hem only to geten, by nightes and by dayes; in the getinge of which good the strengthe of good folk is ful wel y-sene. for right so as thou mightest demen him mighty of goinge, that gooth on his feet til he mighte come to thilke 120 place, fro the whiche place ther ne laye no wey forther to ben gon; right so most thou nedes demen him for right mighty, that geteth and ateyneth to the ende of alle thinges that ben to desire, biyonde the whiche ende ther nis nothing to desire. of the which power of good folk men may conclude, that the wikked 125 {99} men semen to be bareine and naked of alle strengthe. for-why forleten they vertues and folwen vyces? nis it nat for that they ne knowen nat the goodes? but what thing is more feble and more caitif thanne is the blindnesse of ignoraunce? or elles they knowen ful wel whiche thinges that they oughten folwe, but 130 lecherye and coveityse overthroweth hem mistorned; and certes, so doth distemperaunce to feble men, that ne mowen nat wrastlen ayeins the vyces. ne knowen they nat thanne wel that they forleten the good wilfully, and tornen hem wilfully to vyces? and in this wyse they ne forleten nat only to ben mighty, but they 135 forleten al-outrely in any wyse for to ben. for they that forleten the comune fyn of alle thinges that ben, they forleten also therwith-al for to ben . and per-aventure it sholde semen to som folk that this were a merveile to seyen: that shrewes, whiche that contienen the more 140 partye of men, ne ben nat ne han no beinge; but natheles, it is so, and thus stant this thing. for they that ben shrewes, i deneye nat that they ben shrewes; but i deneye, and seye simplely and pleinly, that they ne ben nat, ne han no beinge. for right as thou mightest seyen of the carayne of a man, that it were a deed 145 man, but thou ne mightest nat simplely callen it a man; so graunte i wel forsothe, that vicious folk ben wikked, but i ne may nat graunten absolutly and simplely that they ben. for thilke thing that with-holdeth ordre and kepeth nature, thilke thing is and hath beinge; but what thing that faileth of that, that is to seyn, 150 that he forleteth naturel ordre , he forleteth thilke thing that is set in his nature. but thou wolt seyn, that shrewes mowen . certes, that ne deneye i nat; but certes, hir power ne descendeth nat of strengthe, but of feblesse. for they mowen don wikkednesses; the whiche they ne mighte nat don, yif they mighten dwellen in 155 the forme and in the doinge of good folk. and thilke power sheweth ful evidently that they ne mowen right naught. for so as i have gadered and proeved a litel her-biforn, that yvel is naught; and so as shrewes mowen only but shrewednesses, this conclusioun is al cleer, that shrewes ne mowen right naught, ne 160 han no power. {100} and for as moche as thou understonde which is the strengthe of this power of shrewes, i have definisshed a litel her-biforn, that nothing is so mighty as soverein good.' 'that is sooth,' quod i. 165 'and thilke same soverein good may don non yvel?' 'certes, no,' quod i. 'is ther any wight thanne,' quod she, 'that weneth that men mowen doon alle thinges?' 'no man,' quod i, 'but-yif he be out of his witte.' 170 'but, certes, shrewes mowen don yvel,' quod she. 'ye, wolde god,' quod i, 'that they mighten don non!'

'the engendringe of 30 alle thinges,' quod she, 'and alle the progressiouns of muable nature, and al that moeveth in any manere, taketh his causes, his ordre, and his formes, of the stablenesse of the divyne thoght; and thilke divyne thought, that is y-set and put in the tour , that is to seyn, in the heighte , of the simplicitee of god, stablissheth 35 many maner gyses to thinges that ben to done; the whiche maner, whan that men loken it in thilke pure clennesse of the divyne intelligence, it is y-cleped purviaunce; but whan thilke maner is referred by men to thinges that it moveth and disponeth, thanne of olde men it was cleped destinee. the whiche thinges, 40 yif that any wight loketh wel in his thought the strengthe of that oon and of that other, he shal lightly mowen seen, that thise two thinges ben dyverse. for purviaunce is thilke divyne reson that is establisshed in the soverein prince of thinges; the whiche purviaunce disponeth alle thinges. but destinee is the disposicioun 45 and ordinaunce clyvinge to moevable thinges, by the whiche disposicioun the purviaunce knitteth alle thinges in hir ordres; for purviaunce embraceth alle thinges to-hepe, al-thogh that they ben dyverse, and al-thogh they ben infinite; but destinee departeth and ordeineth alle thinges singulerly, and divyded in 50 moevinges, in places, in formes, in tymes, as thus: lat the unfoldinge of temporel ordinaunce, assembled and ooned in the lokinge of the divyne thought, be cleped purviaunce; and thilke same assemblinge and ooninge, divyded and unfolden by tymes, lat that ben called destinee. and al-be-it so that thise thinges 55 ben dyverse, yit natheles hangeth that oon on that other; for-why the order destinal procedeth of the simplicitee of purviaunce. for right as a werkman, that aperceyveth in his thoght the forme of the thing that he wol make, and moeveth the effect of the werk, and ledeth that he hadde loked biforn in his thoght simply 60 and presently, by temporel ordinaunce: certes, right so god disponeth in his purviaunce, singulerly and stably, the thinges that ben to done, but he aministreth in many maneres and in {116} dyverse tymes, by destinee, thilke same thinges that he hath disponed. 65 thanne, whether that destinee be exercysed outher by some divyne spirits, servaunts to the divyne purviaunce, or elles by som sowle , or elles by alle nature servinge to god, or elles by the celestial moevinges of sterres, or elles by the vertu of angeles, or elles by the dyverse subtilitee of develes, or elles by any of hem, 70 or elles by hem alle, the destinal ordinaunce is y-woven and acomplisshed. certes, it is open thing, that the purviaunce is an unmoevable and simple forme of thinges to done; and the moveable bond and the temporel ordinaunce of thinges, whiche that the divyne simplicitee of purviaunce hath ordeyned to done, 75 that is destinee. for which it is, that alle thinges that ben put under destinee ben, certes, subgits to purviaunce, to whiche purviaunce destinee itself is subgit and under. but some thinges ben put under purviaunce, that surmounten the ordinaunce of destinee; and tho ben thilke that stably ben y-ficched negh to the 80 firste godhed: they surmounten the ordre of destinal moevabletee. for right as of cercles that tornen a-boute a same centre or a-boute a poynt, thilke cercle that is innerest or most with-inne ioyneth to the simplesse of the middel, and is, as it were, a centre or a poynt to that other cercles that tornen a-bouten him; and thilke that is 85 outterest, compassed by larger envyronninge, is unfolden by larger spaces, in so moche as it is forthest fro the middel simplicitee of the poynt; and yif ther be any-thing that knitteth and felawshippeth him-self to thilke middel poynt, it is constreined in-to simplicitee, that is to seyn, in-to unmoevabletee , and it ceseth 90 to be shad and to fleten dyversely: right so, by semblable resoun, thilke thing that departeth forthest fro the first thoght of god, it is unfolden and summitted to gretter bondes of destinee: and in so moche is the thing more free and laus fro destinee, as it axeth and holdeth him ner to thilke centre of thinges, that is to seyn, god . 95 and yif the thing clyveth to the stedefastnesse of the thoght of god, and be with-oute moevinge, certes, it sormounteth the necessitee of {117} destinee. thanne right swich comparisoun as it is of skilinge to understondinge, and of thing that is engendred to thing that is, and of tyme to eternitee, and of the cercle to the centre, right so is the 100 ordre of moevable destinee to the stable simplicitee of purviaunce. thilke ordinaunce moeveth the hevene and the sterres, and atempreth the elements to-gider amonges hem-self, and transformeth hem by entrechaungeable mutacioun; and thilke same ordre neweth ayein alle thinges growinge and fallinge a-doun, by 105 semblable progressiouns of sedes and of sexes, that is to seyn, male and femele . and this ilke ordre constreineth the fortunes and the dedes of men by a bond of causes, nat able to ben unbounde; the whiche destinal causes, whan they passen out fro the biginninges of the unmoevable purviaunce, it mot nedes be that they 110 ne be nat mutable. and thus ben the thinges ful wel y-governed, yif that the simplicitee dwellinge in the divyne thoght sheweth forth the ordre of causes, unable to ben y-bowed ; and this ordre constreineth by his propre stabletee the moevable thinges, or elles they sholden fleten folily. for which it is , that alle thinges semen 115 to ben confus and trouble to us men, for we ne mowen nat considere thilke ordinaunce; natheles , the propre maner of every thinge, dressinge hem to goode, disponeth hem alle. for ther nis no-thing don for cause of yvel; ne thilke thing that is don by wikkede folk nis nat don for yvel . the whiche 120 shrewes, as i have shewed ful plentivously, seken good, but wikked errour mistorneth hem, ne the ordre cominge fro the poynt of soverein good ne declyneth nat fro his biginninge. but thou mayst seyn , what unreste may ben a worse confusioun than that gode men han somtyme adversitee and somtyme prosperitee, 125 and shrewes also now han thinges that they desiren, and now thinges that they haten? whether men liven now in swich hoolnesse of thoght, ( as who seyth, ben men now so wyse ), that swiche folk as they demen to ben gode folk or shrewes, that it moste nedes ben that folk ben swiche as they wenen? but in 130 this manere the domes of men discorden, that thilke men that some folk demen worthy of mede, other folk demen hem worthy of torment. but lat us graunte, i pose that som man may wel demen or knowen the gode folk and the badde; may he thanne knowen {118} and seen thilke innereste atempraunce of corages, as it hath ben 135 wont to be seyd of bodies; as who seyth, may a man speken and determinen of atempraunces in corages, as men were wont to demen or speken of complexiouns and atempraunces of bodies? ne it ne is nat an unlyk miracle, to hem that ne knowen it nat, ( as who seith, but it is lyke a merveil or a miracle to hem that ne knowen it nat ), why that 140 swete thinges ben covenable to some bodies that ben hole, and to some bodies bittere thinges ben covenable; and also, why that some syke folk ben holpen with lighte medicynes, and some folk ben holpen with sharpe medicynes. but natheles, the leche that knoweth the manere and the atempraunce of hele and of maladye, 145 ne merveileth of it no-thing. but what other thing semeth hele of corages but bountee and prowesse? and what other thing semeth maladye of corages but vyces? who is elles kepere of good or dryver awey of yvel, but god, governour and lecher of thoughtes? the whiche god, whan he hath biholden from the 150 heye tour of his purveaunce, he knoweth what is covenable to every wight, and leneth hem that he wot that is covenable to hem. lo, her-of comth and her-of is don this noble miracle of the ordre destinal, whan god, that al knoweth, doth swiche thing, of which thing that unknowinge folk ben astoned. but for to constreine , 155 as who seyth, but for to comprehende and telle a fewe thinges of the divyne deepnesse, the whiche that mannes resoun may understonde, thilke man that thou wenest to ben right iuste and right kepinge of equitee, the contrarie of that semeth to the divyne purveaunce, that al wot. and lucan, my familer , telleth that 160 "the victorious cause lykede to the goddes, and the cause over-comen lykede to catoun." thanne, what-so-ever thou mayst seen that is don in this werld unhoped or unwened, certes, it is the right ordre of thinges; but, as to thy wikkede opinioun, it is a confusioun. but i suppose that som man be so wel y-thewed, 165 that the divyne iugement and the iugement of mankinde acorden hem to-gider of him; but he is so unstedefast of corage, that, yif any adversitee come to him, he wol forleten, par-aventure, to continue innocence, by the whiche he ne may nat with-holden fortune. thanne the wyse dispensacioun of god spareth him, the 170 {119} whiche man adversitee mighte enpeyren; for that god wol nat suffren him to travaile, to whom that travaile nis nat covenable. another man is parfit in alle vertues, and is an holy man, and negh to god, so that the purviaunce of god wolde demen, that it were a felonye that he were touched with any adversitees; so 175 that he wol nat suffre that swich a man be moeved with any bodily maladye. but so as seyde a philosophre, the more excellent by me : he seyde in grek , that "vertues han edified the body of the holy man." and ofte tyme it bitydeth, that the somme of thinges that ben to done is taken to governe to gode folk, for that 180 the malice haboundaunt of shrewes sholde ben abated. and god yeveth and departeth to othre folk prosperitees and adversitees y-medled to-hepe, after the qualitee of hir corages, and remordeth som folk by adversitee , for they ne sholde nat wexen proude by longe welefulnesse. and other folk he suffreth to ben travailed 185 with harde thinges, for that they sholden confermen the vertues of corage by the usage and exercitacioun of pacience. and other folk dreden more than they oughten [that] whiche they mighten wel beren; and somme dispyse that they mowe nat beren; and thilke folk god ledeth in-to experience of himself by 190 aspre and sorwful thinges. and many othre folk han bought honourable renoun of this world by the prys of glorious deeth. and som men, that ne mowen nat ben overcomen by torments, have yeven ensaumple to othre folk, that vertu may nat ben overcomen by adversitees; and of alle thinges ther nis no doute, that 195 they ne ben don rightfully and ordenely, to the profit of hem to whom we seen thise thinges bityde. for certes, that adversitee comth somtyme to shrewes, and somtyme that that they desiren, it comth of thise forseide causes. and of sorwful thinges that bityden to shrewes , certes, no man ne wondreth; for alle men 200 wenen that they han wel deserved it, and that they ben of wikkede merite ; of whiche shrewes the torment somtyme agasteth othre to don felonyes, and somtyme it amendeth hem that suffren the torments. and the prosperitee that is yeven to shrewes {120} sheweth a greet argument to gode folk, what thing they sholde 205 demen of thilke welefulnesse, the whiche prosperitee men seen ofte serven to shrewes . in the which thing i trowe that god dispenseth; for, per-aventure, the nature of som man is so overthrowinge to yvel , and so uncovenable, that the nedy povertee of his houshold mighte rather egren him to don felonyes. and to 210 the maladye of him god putteth remedie, to yeven him richesses. and som other man biholdeth his conscience defouled with sinnes, and maketh comparisoun of his fortune and of him-self; and dredeth, per-aventure, that his blisfulnesse, of which the usage is ioyeful to him, that the lesinge of thilke blisfulnesse ne be nat 215 sorwful to him; and therfor he wol chaunge his maneres, and, for he dredeth to lese his fortune, he forleteth his wikkednesse. to othre folk is welefulnesse y-yeven unworthily, the whiche overthroweth hem in-to distruccioun that they han deserved. and to som othre folk is yeven power to punisshen, for that it shal be 220 cause of continuacioun and exercysinge to gode folk and cause of torment to shrewes. for so as ther nis non alyaunce by-twixe gode folk and shrewes, ne shrewes ne mowen nat acorden amonges hem-self. and why nat? for shrewes discorden of hem-self by hir vyces, the whiche vyces al to-renden hir consciences; and don 225 ofte tyme thinges, the whiche thinges, whan they han don hem, they demen that tho thinges ne sholden nat han ben don. for which thing thilke soverein purveaunce hath maked ofte tyme fair miracle; so that shrewes han maked shrewes to ben gode men. for whan that som shrewes seen that they suffren wrongfully 230 felonyes of othre shrewes, they wexen eschaufed in-to hate of hem that anoyeden hem, and retornen to the frut of vertu, whan they studien to ben unlyk to hem that they han hated. certes, only this is the divyne might, to the whiche might yveles ben thanne gode, whan it useth tho yveles covenably, and draweth out the 235 effect of any gode; as who seyth, that yvel is good only to the might of god, for the might of god ordeyneth thilke yvel to good . for oon ordre embraseth alle thinges, so that what wight that departeth fro the resoun of thilke ordre which that is assigned to {121} him, algates yit he slydeth in-to another ordre, so that no-thing 240 nis leveful to folye in the reame of the divyne purviaunce; as who seyth, nothing nis with-outen ordinaunce in the reame of the divyne purviaunce ; sin that the right stronge god governeth alle thinges in this world. for it nis nat leveful to man to comprehenden by wit, ne unfolden by word, alle the subtil ordinaunces and disposiciouns 245 of the divyne entente. for only it oughte suffise to han loked, that god him-self, maker of alle natures, ordeineth and dresseth alle thinges to gode;

and her-to i adde yit this thing : that, right as whan that i wot {133} that a thing is, it bihoveth by necessitee that thilke selve thing be; and eek, whan i have knowe that any thing shal bityden, so byhoveth it by necessitee that thilke thing bityde:—so folweth it 70 thanne, that the bitydinge of the thing y-wist biforn ne may nat ben eschued. and at the laste , yif that any wight wene a thing to ben other weyes thanne it is, it is nat only unscience, but it is deceivable opinioun ful diverse and fer fro the sothe of science. wherfore, yif any thing be so to comen, that the bitydinge of hit 75 ne be nat certein ne necessarie, who may weten biforn that thilke thing is to comen? for right as science ne may nat ben medled with falsnesse ( as who seyth, that yif i wot a thing, it ne may nat be false that i ne wot it ), right so thilke thing that is conceived by science ne may nat ben non other weys than as it is conceived. 80 for that is the cause why that science wanteth lesing ( as who seyth, why that witinge ne receiveth nat lesinge of that it wot ); for it bihoveth, by necessitee, that every thing be right as science comprehendeth it to be. what shal i thanne seyn? in whiche manere knoweth god biforn the thinges to comen, yif they ne be 85 nat certein? for yif that he deme that they ben to comen uneschewably, and so may be that it is possible that they ne shollen nat comen, god is deceived. but nat only to trowen that god is deceived, but for to speke it with mouth, it is a felonous sinne. but yif that god wot that, right so as thinges ben to 90 comen , so shullen they comen—so that he wite egaly , as who seyth, indifferently , that thinges mowen ben doon or elles nat y-doon—what is thilke prescience that ne comprehendeth no certein thing ne stable? or elles what difference is ther bitwixe the prescience and thilke iape-worthy divyninge of tiresie the 95 divynour, that seyde : "al that i seye," quod he, "either it shal be, or elles it ne shal nat be?" or elles how mochel is worth the devyne prescience more than the opinioun of mankinde, yif so be that it demeth the thinges uncertein, as men doon; of the whiche domes of men the bitydinge nis nat certein? but yif so be that 100 non uncertein thing ne may ben in him that is right certein welle {134} of alle thinges, thanne is the bitydinge certein of thilke thinges whiche he hath wist biforn fermely to comen. for which it folweth, that the freedom of the conseiles and of the werkes of mankind nis non, sin that the thoght of god, that seeth alle 105 thinges without errour of falsnesse, bindeth and constreineth hem to a bitydinge by necessitee . and yif this thing be ones y-graunted and received, that is to seyn, that ther nis no free wille , than sheweth it wel, how greet destruccioun and how grete damages ther folwen of thinges of mankinde. for in ydel ben 110 ther thanne purposed and bihight medes to gode folk, and peynes to badde folk, sin that no moevinge of free corage voluntarie ne hath nat deserved hem, that is to seyn, neither mede ne peyne ; and it sholde seme thanne, that thilke thing is alderworst, which that is now demed for aldermost iust and most rightful, that is to seyn , 115 that shrewes ben punisshed, or elles that gode folk ben y-gerdoned: the whiche folk, sin that hir propre wil ne sent hem nat to that oon ne to that other, that is to seyn, neither to gode ne to harm , but constreineth hem certein necessitee of thinges to comen: thanne ne shollen ther nevere ben, ne nevere weren, vyce ne vertu, but it 120 sholde rather ben confusioun of alle desertes medled with-outen discrecioun . and yit ther folweth an-other inconvenient , of the whiche ther ne may ben thoght no more felonous ne more wikke; and that is this : that, so as the ordre of thinges is y-led and comth of the purviaunce of god, ne that no-thing nis leveful to 125 the conseiles of mankinde ( as who seyth, that men han no power to doon no-thing, ne wilne no-thing ), than folweth it, that oure vyces ben referred to the maker of alle good ( as who seyth, than folweth it, that god oughte han the blame of oure vyces, sin he constreineth us by necessitee to doon vyces ). thanne is ther no resoun to hopen in 130 god , ne for to preyen to god ; for what sholde any wight hopen to god , or why sholde he preyen to god , sin that the ordenaunce of destinee, which that ne may nat ben inclyned, knitteth and streineth alle thinges that men may desiren? thanne sholde ther be doon awey thilke only allyaunce bitwixen god and men, that is to seyn, 135 {135} to hopen and to preyen. but by the prys of rightwisnesse and of verray mekenesse we deserven the gerdoun of the divyne grace, which that is inestimable, that is to seyn, that it is so greet, that it ne may nat ben ful y-preysed . and this is only the manere, that is to seyn, hope and preyeres , for which it semeth that men mowen 140 speke with god, and by resoun of supplicacioun be conioined to thilke cleernesse, that nis nat aproched no rather or that men beseken it and impetren it. and yif men wene nat that hope ne preyeres ne han no strengthes, by the necessitee of thinges to comen y-received, what thing is ther thanne by whiche we mowen 145 ben conioined and clyven to thilke soverein prince of thinges?

'thanne ayeinward,' quod she, 'i suppose that ther be prescience, but that it ne putteth no necessitee to thinges; thanne trowe i, that thilke selve freedom of wil shal dwellen al hool and {138} absolut and unbounden. but thou wolt seyn that, al-be-it so that 40 prescience nis nat cause of the necessitee of bitydinge to thinges to comen, algates yit it is a signe that the thinges ben to bityden by necessitee. by this manere thanne, al-thogh the prescience ne hadde never y-ben, yit algate or at the leeste weye it is certein thing, that the endes and bitydinges of thinges to comen sholden 45 ben necessarie. for every signe sheweth and signifyeth only what the thing is, but it ne maketh nat the thing that it signifyeth. for which it bihoveth first to shewen, that no-thing ne bitydeth that it ne bitydeth by necessitee, so that it may appere that the prescience is signe of this necessitee; or elles, yif ther nere no necessitee, 50 certes, thilke prescience ne mighte nat be signe of thing that nis nat. but certes, it is now certein that the proeve of this, y-sustened by stidefast resoun, ne shal nat ben lad ne proeved by signes ne by arguments y-taken fro with-oute, but by causes covenable and necessarie. but thou mayst seyn , how may it be 55 that the thinges ne bityden nat that ben y-purveyed to comen? but, certes, right as we trowen that tho thinges which that the purviance wot biforn to comen ne ben nat to bityden; but that ne sholden we nat demen; but rather, al-thogh that they shal bityden, yit ne have they no necessitee of hir kinde to bityden. 60 and this maystow lightly aperceiven by this that i shal seyn. for we seen many thinges whan they ben don biforn oure eyen, right as men seen the cartere worken in the torninge or atempringe or adressinge of hise cartes or charietes. and by this manere ( as who seith, maystow understonde ) of alle othere workmen . is ther 65 thanne any necessitee, as who seith, in oure lokinge , that constreineth or compelleth any of thilke thinges to ben don so?' boece. 'nay,' quod i; 'for in ydel and in veyn were al the effect of craft, yif that alle thinges weren moeved by constreininge;' that is to seyn, by constreininge of oure eyen or of oure sight . 70 philosophie. 'the thinges thanne,' quod she, 'that, whan men doon hem, ne han no necessitee that men doon hem, eek tho {139} same thinges, first or they ben doon, they ben to comen with-oute necessitee. for-why ther ben somme thinges to bityden, of which the endes and the bitydinges of hem ben absolut and quit of alle 75 necessitee. for certes, i ne trowe nat that any man wolde seyn this: that tho thinges that men doon now, that they ne weren to bityden first or they weren y-doon; and thilke same thinges, al-thogh that men had y-wist hem biforn, yit they han free bitydinges. for right as science of thinges present ne bringeth in 80 no necessitee to thinges that men doon, right so the prescience of thinges to comen ne bringeth in no necessitee to thinges to bityden. but thou mayst seyn, that of thilke same it is y-douted, as whether that of thilke thinges that ne han non issues and bitydinges necessaries, yif ther-of may ben any prescience; for 85 certes, they semen to discorden. for thou wenest that, yif that thinges ben y-seyn biforn, that necessitee folweth hem; and yif necessitee faileth hem, they ne mighten nat ben wist biforn, and that no-thing ne may ben comprehended by science but certein; and yif tho thinges that ne han no certein bitydinges ben purveyed 90 as certein, it sholde ben dirknesse of opinioun, nat soothfastnesse of science. and thou wenest that it be diverse fro the hoolnesse of science that any man sholde deme a thing to ben other-weys thanne it is it-self. and the cause of this erroure is, that of alle the thinges that every wight hath y-knowe, they wenen that tho 95 thinges been y-knowe al-oonly by the strengthe and by the nature of the thinges that ben y-wist or y-knowe; and it is al the contrarie. for al that ever is y-knowe, it is rather comprehended and knowen, nat after his strengthe and his nature, but after the facultee, that is to seyn, the power and the nature , of hem that 100 knowen. and, for that this thing shal mowen shewen by a short ensaumple: the same roundnesse of a body, other-weys the sighte of the eye knoweth it, and other-weyes the touchinge. the lokinge, by castinge of his bemes, waiteth and seeth from afer al the body to-gidere, with-oute moevinge of it-self; but the touchinge 105 clyveth and conioineth to the rounde body, and moeveth aboute {140} the environinge, and comprehendeth by parties the roundnesse. and the man him-self, other-weys wit biholdeth him, and other-weys imaginacioun, and other-weys resoun, and other-weys intelligence. for the wit comprehendeth withoute-forth the 110 figure of the body of the man that is establissed in the matere subiect; but the imaginacioun comprehendeth only the figure withoute the matere. resoun surmounteth imaginacioun, and comprehendeth by universal lokinge the comune spece that is in the singuler peces. but the eye of intelligence is heyere; for 115 it surmounteth the environinge of the universitee , and looketh, over that, by pure subtilitee of thoght, thilke same simple forme of man that is perdurably in the divyne thoght . in whiche this oughte greetly to ben considered, that the heyeste strengthe to comprehenden thinges enbraseth and contieneth the lowere 120 strengthe; but the lowere strengthe ne aryseth nat in no manere to heyere strengthe. for wit ne may no-thing comprehende out of matere, ne the imaginacioun ne loketh nat the universels speces, ne resoun taketh nat the simple forme so as intelligence taketh it ; but intelligence, that looketh al aboven, whan it hath 125 comprehended the forme, it knoweth and demeth alle the thinges that ben under that forme. but she knoweth hem in thilke manere in the whiche it comprehendeth thilke same simple forme that ne may never ben knowen to none of that other; that is to seyn, to none of tho three forseide thinges of the sowle . for it knoweth 130 the universitee of resoun, and the figure of the imaginacioun, and the sensible material conceived by wit ; ne it ne useth nat nor of resoun ne of imaginacioun ne of wit withoute-forth; but it biholdeth alle thinges, so as i shal seye, by a strok of thought formely, withoute discours or collacioun . certes resoun, whan it 135 looketh any-thing universel, it ne useth nat of imaginacioun, nor of witte, and algates yit it comprehendeth the thinges imaginable and sensible; for resoun is she that diffinisseth the universel of hir conseyte right thus:—man is a resonable two-foted beest. and {141} how so that this knowinge is universel, yet nis ther no wight that 140 ne woot wel that a man is a thing imaginable and sensible; and this same considereth wel resoun; but that nis nat by imaginacioun nor by wit, but it looketh it by a resonable concepcioun. also imaginacioun, al-be-it so that it taketh of wit the beginninges to seen and to formen the figures, algates, al-thogh that wit ne were 145 nat present, yit it environeth and comprehendeth alle thinges sensible; nat by resoun sensible of deminge, but by resoun imaginatif. seestow nat thanne that alle the thinges, in knowinge, usen more of hir facultee or of hir power than they doon of the facultee or power of thinges that ben y-knowe? ne that nis nat 150 wrong; for so as every iugement is the dede or doinge of him that demeth, it bihoveth that every wight performe the werk and his entencioun, nat of foreine power, but of his propre power. pr. iv. 2. c. deuynede;

and al-be-it so that 5 the passioun of the body, that is to seyn, the wit or the suffraunce , goth to-forn the strengthe of the workinge corage, the which {143} passioun or suffraunce clepeth forth the dede of the thoght in him-self, and moeveth and exciteth in this mene whyle the formes that resten withinne-forth; and yif that, in sensible bodies, as i have 10 seyd, our corage nis nat y-taught or empreinted by passioun to knowe thise thinges , but demeth and knoweth, of his owne strengthe, the passioun or suffraunce subiect to the body: moche more thanne tho thinges that ben absolut and quite fro alle talents or affecciouns of bodies, as god or his aungeles , ne folwen nat in 15 discerninge thinges obiect fro withoute-forth, but they accomplisshen and speden the dede of hir thoght. by this resoun thanne ther comen many maner knowinges to dyverse and differinge substaunces. for the wit of the body, the whiche wit is naked and despoiled of alle other knowinges, thilke wit 20 comth to beestes that ne mowen nat moeven hem-self her and ther, as oystres and muscules, and other swiche shelle-fish of the see, that clyven and ben norisshed to roches. but the imaginacioun comth to remuable beestes, that semen to han talent to fleen or to desiren any thing. but resoun is al-only to the linage 25 of mankinde, right as intelligence is only [to] the devyne nature: of which it folweth, that thilke knowinge is more worth than thise othre, sin it knoweth by his propre nature nat only his subiect, as who seith, it ne knoweth nat al-only that apertieneth properly to his knowinge , but it knoweth the subiects of alle other knowinges. 30 but how shal it thanne be, yif that wit and imaginacioun stryven ayein resoninge, and seyn, that of thilke universel thing that resoun weneth to seen, that it nis right naught? for wit and imaginacioun seyn that that, that is sensible or imaginable, it ne may nat be universel. thanne is either the iugement of resoun 35 sooth, ne that ther nis nothing sensible; or elles, for that resoun wot wel that many thinges ben subiect to wit and to imaginacioun, thanne is the concepcioun of resoun veyn and false, which that loketh and comprehendeth that that is sensible and singuler as universel. and yif that resoun wolde answeren ayein to thise 40 two, that is to seyn, to witte and to imaginacioun , and seyn, that soothly she hir-self, that is to seyn, resoun , loketh and comprehendeth, {144} by resoun of universalitee, bothe that that is sensible and that that is imaginable; and that thilke two, that is to seyn, wit and imaginacioun , ne mowen nat strecchen ne enhansen hem-self 45 to the knowinge of universalitee, for that the knowinge of hem ne may exceden ne surmounte the bodily figures: certes, of the knowinge of thinges, men oughten rather yeven credence to the more stedefast and to the more parfit iugement. in this maner stryvinge thanne, we that han strengthe of resoninge and 50 of imagininge and of wit, that is to seyn, by resoun and by imaginacioun and by wit , we sholde rather preyse the cause of resoun; as who seith, than the cause of wit and of imaginacioun . semblable thing is it, that the resoun of mankinde ne weneth nat that the devyne intelligence bi-holdeth or knoweth thinges to 55 comen, but right as the resoun of mankinde knoweth hem. for thou arguest and seyst thus: that yif it ne seme nat to men that some thinges han certein and necessarie bitydinges, they ne mowen nat ben wist biforn certeinly to bityden. and thanne nis ther no prescience of thilke thinges; and yif we trowe that 60 prescience be in thise thinges, thanne is ther no-thing that it ne bitydeth by necessitee. but certes, yif we mighten han the iugement of the devyne thoght, as we ben parsoneres of resoun, right so as we han demed that it behoveth that imaginacioun and wit be binethe resoun, right so wolde we demen that it were rightful 65 thing, that mannes resoun oughte to submitten it-self and to ben binethe the divyne thoght. for which , yif that we mowen, as who seith, that, yif that we mowen, i counseyle, that we enhanse us in-to the heighte of thilke sovereyn intelligence; for ther shal resoun wel seen that, that it ne may nat biholden in it-self. and 70 certes that is this, in what maner the prescience of god seeth alle thinges certeins and diffinisshed, al-thogh they ne han no certein issues or bitydinges;

so that we mowen eek knowen what his science is. the commune iugement of alle creatures resonables thanne is this: that god is eterne. lat us considere thanne what is eternitee; for certes that shal shewen us to-gidere the devyne nature and the devyne science. 10 eternitee, thanne, is parfit possessioun and al-togidere of lyf {146} interminable; and that sheweth more cleerly by the comparisoun or the collacioun of temporel thinges. for al thing that liveth in tyme it is present, and procedeth fro preterits in-to futures, that is to seyn, fro tyme passed in-to tyme cominge ; ne ther nis no-thing 15 establisshed in tyme that may enbracen to-gider al the space of his lyf. for certes, yit ne hath it taken the tyme of to-morwe, and it hath lost the tyme of yisterday. and certes, in the lyf of this day, ye ne liven no more but right as in the moevable and transitorie moment. thanne thilke thing that suffreth temporel 20 condicioun, al-thogh that it never bigan to be, ne thogh it never cese for to be, as aristotle demed of the world, and al-thogh that the lyf of it be strecched with infinitee of tyme, yit algates nis it no swich thing that men mighten trowen by right that it is eterne. for al-thogh that it comprehende and embrace the space 25 of lyf infinit, yit algates ne embraceth it nat the space of the lyf al-togider; for it ne hath nat the futures that ne ben nat yit, ne it ne hath no lenger the preterits that ben y-doon or y-passed . but thilke thing thanne, that hath and comprehendeth to-gider al the plentee of the lyf interminable, to whom ther ne faileth naught of 30 the future, and to whom ther nis naught of the preterit escaped nor y-passed, thilke same is y-witnessed and y-proeved by right to be eterne. and it bihoveth by necessitee that thilke thing be al-wey present to him-self, and compotent; as who seith, al-wey present to him-self, and so mighty that al be right at his plesaunce ; 35 and that he have al present the infinitee of the moevable tyme. wher-for som men trowen wrongfully that, whan they heren that it semede to plato that this world ne hadde never beginninge of tyme, ne that it never shal han failinge, they wenen in this maner that this world be maked coeterne with his maker; as who 40 seith, they wene that this world and god ben maked togider eterne, and that is a wrongful weninge . for other thing is it to ben y-lad by lyf interminable, as plato graunted to the world, and other thing is it to embrace to-gider al the present of the lyf interminable, the whiche thing it is cleer and manifest that it is propre to the 45 devyne thoght. {147} ne it ne sholde nat semen to us, that god is elder thanne thinges that ben y-maked by quantitee of tyme, but rather by the propretee of his simple nature. for this ilke infinit moevinge of temporel thinges folweth this presentarie estat of lyf unmoevable; 50 and so as it ne may nat countrefeten it ne feynen it ne be evenlyke to it for the inmoevabletee, that is to seyn, that is in the eternitee of god , it faileth and falleth in-to moevinge fro the simplicitee of the presence of god , and disencreseth in-to the infinit quantitee of future and of preterit: and so as it ne may nat han 55 to-gider al the plentee of the lyf, algates yit, for as moche as it ne ceseth never for to ben in som maner, it semeth som-del to us, that it folweth and resembleth thilke thing that it ne may nat atayne to ne fulfillen, and bindeth it-self to som maner presence of this litel and swifte moment: the which presence of this litel 60 and swifte moment , for that it bereth a maner image or lyknesse of the ay-dwellinge presence of god , it graunteth, to swiche maner thinges as it bitydeth to, that it semeth hem as thise thinges han y-ben, and ben. and, for that the presence of swich litel moment ne may nat 65 dwelle, ther-for it ravisshed and took the infinit wey of tyme, that is to seyn, by successioun ; and by this maner is it y-doon, for that it sholde continue the lyf in goinge, of the whiche lyf it ne mighte nat enbrace the plentee in dwellinge. and for-thy, yif we wollen putten worthy names to thinges, and folwen plato, lat us seye 70 thanne soothly, that god is eterne, and the world is perpetuel. thanne, sin that every iugement knoweth and comprehendeth by his owne nature thinges that ben subiect un-to him, ther is soothly to god, al-weys, an eterne and presentarie estat; and the science of him, that over-passeth al temporel moevement, dwelleth in the 75 simplicitee of his presence, and embraceth and considereth alle the infinit spaces of tymes, preterits and futures, and loketh, in his simple knowinge, alle thinges of preterit right as they weren y-doon presently right now. yif thou wolt thanne thenken and avyse the prescience, by which it knoweth alle thinges, thou ne 80 shal nat demen it as prescience of thinges to comen, but thou shalt demen it more rightfully that it is science of presence or of {148} instaunce, that never ne faileth. for which it nis nat y-cleped "previdence," but it sholde rather ben cleped "purviaunce," that is establisshed ful fer fro right lowe thinges, and biholdeth from 85 a-fer alle thinges, right as it were fro the heye heighte of thinges. why axestow thanne , or why desputestow thanne, that thilke thinges ben doon by necessitee whiche that ben y-seyn and knowen by the devyne sighte, sin that, forsothe, men ne maken nat thilke thinges necessarie which that they seen ben y-doon in 90 hir sighte? for addeth thy biholdinge any necessitee to thilke thinges that thou biholdest presente?' 'nay,' quod i. philosophie. 'certes, thanne, if men mighte maken any digne comparisoun or collacioun of the presence devyne and of the 95 presence of mankinde, right so as ye seen some thinges in this temporel present, right so seeth god alle thinges by his eterne present. wher-fore this devyne prescience ne chaungeth nat the nature ne the propretee of thinges, but biholdeth swiche thinges present to him-ward as they shullen bityde to yow-ward in tyme 100 to comen. ne it confoundeth nat the iugement of thinges; but by o sighte of his thought, he knoweth the thinges to comen, as wel necessarie as nat necessarie. right so as whan ye seen to-gider a man walken on the erthe and the sonne arysen in the hevene, al-be-it so that ye seen and biholden that oon and 105 that other to-gider, yit natheles ye demen and discernen that that oon is voluntarie and that other necessarie. right so thanne the devyne lookinge, biholdinge alle thinges under him, ne troubleth nat the qualitee of thinges that ben certeinly present to him-ward; but, as to the condicioun of tyme, forsothe, they ben future. for 110 which it folweth, that this nis noon opinioun, but rather a stedefast knowinge, y-strengthed by soothnesse, that, whanne that god knoweth anything to be, he ne unwot nat that thilke thing wanteth necessitee to be; this is to seyn, that, whan that god knoweth any thing to bityde, he wot wel that it ne hath no necessitee to bityde. 115 and yif thou seyst heer, that thilke thing that god seeth to bityde, it ne may nat unbityde ( as who seith, it mot bityde ), and {149} thilke thing that ne may nat unbityde it mot bityde by necessitee, and that thou streyne me by this name of necessitee: certes, i wol wel confessen and biknowe a thing of ful sad trouthe, but 120 unnethe shal ther any wight mowe seen it or come ther-to, but-yif that he be biholder of the devyne thoght. for i wol answeren thee thus: that thilke thing that is future, whan it is referred to the devyne knowinge, thanne is it necessarie; but certes, whan it is understonden in his owne kinde, men seen it is outrely free, 125 and absolut fro alle necessitee . for certes, ther ben two maneres of necessitee. that oon necessitee is simple, as thus: that it bihoveth by necessitee, that alle men be mortal or deedly . another necessitee is conditionel, as thus: yif thou wost that a man walketh, it bihoveth by necessitee 130 that he walke. thilke thing thanne that any wight hath y-knowe to be, it ne may ben non other weyes thanne he knoweth it to be. but this condicioun ne draweth nat with hir thilke necessitee simple. for certes, this necessitee conditionel , the propre nature of it ne maketh it nat, but the adieccioun of the condicioun 135 maketh it . for no necessitee ne constreyneth a man to gon, that goth by his propre wil; al-be-it so that, whan he goth, that it is necessarie that he goth. right on this same maner thanne, yif that the purviaunce of god seeth any thing present, than mot thilke thing ben by necessitee, al-thogh that it ne have 140 no necessitee of his owne nature. but certes, the futures that bityden by freedom of arbitre, god seeth hem alle to-gider present. thise thinges thanne, yif they ben referred to the devyne sighte, thanne ben they maked necessarie by the condicioun of the devyne knowinge. but certes, yif thilke thinges be considered 145 by hem-self, they ben absolut of necessitee , and ne forleten nat ne cesen nat of the libertee of hir owne nature. thanne, certes, with-oute doute, alle the thinges shollen ben doon which that god wot biforn that they ben to comen. but som of hem comen and bityden of free arbitre or of free wille , that, al-be-it so that 150 they bityden, yit algates ne lese they nat hir propre nature in beinge ; by the which first, or that they weren y-doon, they hadden power nat to han bitid.' boece . 'what is this to seyn thanne,' quod i, 'that thinges ne {150} ben nat necessarie by hir propre nature , so as they comen in alle 155 maneres in the lyknesse of necessitee by the condicioun of the devyne science?' philosophie. 'this is the difference,' quod she; 'that tho thinges that i purposede thee a litel heer-biforn, that is to seyn, the sonne arysinge and the man walkinge, that, ther-whyles that 160 thilke thinges been y-doon, they ne mighte nat ben undoon; natheles, that oon of hem, or it was y-doon, it bihoved by necessitee that it was y-doon, but nat that other. right so is it here , that the thinges that god hath present, with-oute doute they shollen been. but som of hem descendeth of the nature of 165 thinges, as the sonne arysinge ; and som descendeth of the power of the doeres, as the man walkinge . thanne seide i no wrong, that yif these thinges ben referred to the devyne knowinge, thanne ben they necessarie; and yif they ben considered by hem-self, thanne ben they absolut fro the bond of necessitee. right so as 170 alle thinges that apereth or sheweth to the wittes, yif thou referre it to resoun, it is universel; and yif thou referre it or loke it to it-self, than is it singuler. but now, yif thou seyst thus, that yif it be in my power to chaunge my purpos, than shal i voide the purviaunce of god , whan that, peraventure, i shal han chaunged 175 the thinges that he knoweth biforn, thanne shal i answere thee thus. certes, thou mayst wel chaunge thy purpos; but, for as mochel as the present soothnesse of the devyne purviaunce biholdeth that thou mayst chaunge thy purpos, and whether thou wolt chaunge it or no, and whiderward that thou torne it, thou ne 180 mayst nat eschuen the devyne prescience; right as thou ne mayst nat fleen the sighte of the presente eye, al-though that thou torne thy-self by thy free wil in-to dyverse acciouns. but thou mayst seyn ayein: "how shal it thanne be? shal nat the devyne science be chaunged by my disposicioun, whan that i wol o thing 185 now, and now another? and thilke prescience, ne semeth it nat to entrechaunge stoundes of knowinge;"' as who seith, ne shal it nat seme to us, that the devyne prescience entrechaungeth hise dyverse stoundes of knowinge, so that it knowe sum-tyme o thing and sum-tyme the contrarie of that thing? 190 {151} 'no, forsothe,' quod i . philosophie.

10 help me, that am the sorwful instrument that helpeth lovers, as i can, to pleyne! for wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne, a woful wight to han a drery fere , and, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere. 15 3. for i, that god of loves servaunts serve, ne dar to love, for myn unlyklinesse, preyen for speed, al sholde i therfor sterve, so fer am i fro his help in derknesse; but nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse 20 to any lover, and his cause avayle, have he my thank , and myn be this travayle! {154} 4. but ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse, if any drope of pitee in yow be, remembreth yow on passed hevinesse 25 that ye han felt, and on the adversitee of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye han felt that love dorste yow displese; or ye han wonne him with to greet an ese. 5. and preyeth for hem that ben in the cas 30 of troilus, as ye may after here, that love hem bringe in hevene to solas, and eek for me preyeth to god so dere, that i have might to shewe, in som manere, swich peyne and wo as loves folk endure, 35 in troilus unsely aventure. 6. and biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred in love, that never nil recovered be, and eek for hem that falsly been apeyred thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she; 40 thus biddeth god, for his benignitee, to graunte hem sone out of this world to pace, that been despeyred out of loves grace. 7. and biddeth eek for hem that been at ese, that god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce, 45 and sende hem might hir ladies so to plese, that it to love be worship and plesaunce. for so hope i my soule best avaunce, to preye for hem that loves servaunts be, and wryte hir wo, and live in charitee. 50 8. and for to have of hem compassioun as though i were hir owene brother dere. now herkeneth with a gode entencioun, for now wol i gon streight to my matere, in whiche ye may the double sorwes here 55 of troilus, in loving of criseyde, and how that she forsook him er she deyde. {155} 9 . it is wel wist, how that the grekes stronge in armes with a thousand shippes wente to troyewardes, and the citee longe 60 assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente, and, in diverse wyse and oon entente, the ravisshing to wreken of eleyne, by paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne. 10. now fil it so, that in the toun ther was 65 dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee, a gret devyn that cleped was calkas, that in science so expert was, that he knew wel that troye sholde destroyed be, by answere of his god, that highte thus, 70 daun phebus or apollo delphicus . 11. so whan this calkas knew by calculinge, and eek by answere of this appollo, that grekes sholden swich a peple bringe, thorugh which that troye moste been for-do, 75 he caste anoon out of the toun to go; for wel wiste he, by sort, that troye sholde destroyed been, ye , wolde who-so nolde. 12. for which, for to departen softely took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse, 80 and to the grekes ost ful prively he stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse, him deden bothe worship and servyse, in trust that he hath conning hem to rede in every peril which that is to drede. 85 13. the noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed, thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken, that calkas traytor fled was, and allyed with hem of grece; and casten to ben wroken on him that falsly hadde his feith so broken; 90 {156} and seyden, he and al his kin at ones ben worthy for to brennen , fel and bones. 14. now hadde calkas left, in this meschaunce, al unwist of this false and wikked dede, his doughter, which that was in gret penaunce, 95 for of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede, as she that niste what was best to rede; for bothe a widowe was she, and allone of any freend, to whom she dorste hir mone. 15. criseyde was this lady name a-right; 100 as to my dome, in al troyes citee nas noon so fair, for passing every wight so aungellyk was hir natyf beautee, that lyk a thing inmortal semed she, as doth an hevenish parfit creature, 105 that doun were sent in scorning of nature. 16. this lady, which that al-day herde at ere hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun, wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere, in widewes habit large of samit broun, 110 on knees she fil biforn ector a-doun; with pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge, his mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge. 17. now was this ector pitous of nature, and saw that she was sorwfully bigoon, 115 and that she was so fair a creature; of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon, and seyde, 'lat your fadres treson goon forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in ioye, dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in troye. 120 18. and al thonour that men may doon yow have, as ferforth as your fader dwelled here, ye shul han, and your body shal men save, as fer as i may ought enquere or here.' and she him thonked with ful humble chere, 125 {157} and ofter wolde , and it hadde ben his wille, and took hir leve, and hoom , and held hir stille. 19. and in hir hous she abood with swich meynee as to hir honour nede was to holde; and whyl she was dwellinge in that citee, 130 kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde. but whether that she children hadde or noon, i rede it nought; therfore i lete it goon. 20. the thinges fellen, as they doon of werre, 135 bitwixen hem of troye and grekes ofte; for som day boughten they of troye it derre, and eft the grekes founden no thing softe the folk of troye; and thus fortune on-lofte , and under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe 140 after hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe. 21. but how this toun com to destruccioun ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle; for it were here a long disgressioun fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle. 145 but the troyane gestes , as they felle, in omer , or in dares, or in dyte, who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte. 22. but though that grekes hem of troye shetten, and hir citee bisegede al a-boute, 150 hir olde usage wolde they not letten, as for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute; but aldermost in honour, out of doute, they hadde a relik hight palladion , that was hir trist a-boven everichon. 155 {158} 23. and so bifel, whan comen was the tyme of aperil, whan clothed is the mede with newe grene, of lusty ver the pryme, and swote smellen floures whyte and rede, in sondry wyses shewed, as i rede, 160 the folk of troye hir observaunces olde, palladiones feste for to holde. 24. and to the temple, in al hir beste wyse, in general, ther wente many a wight, to herknen of palladion the servyse; 165 and namely, so many a lusty knight, so many a lady fresh and mayden bright, ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste, ye, bothe for the seson and the feste. 25. among thise othere folk was criseyda, 170 in widewes habite blak; but nathelees, right as our firste lettre is now an a , in beautee first so stood she, makelees ; hir godly looking gladede al the prees. nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre, 175 nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre 26. as was criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon that hir bihelden in hir blake wede; and yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon, bihinden othere folk, in litel brede, 180 and neigh the dore, ay under shames drede, simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere, with ful assured loking and manere. 27. this troilus, as he was wont to gyde {159} his yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun 185 in thilke large temple on every syde, biholding ay the ladyes of the toun, now here, now there, for no devocioun hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste, but gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste. 190 28. and in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten if knight or squyer of his companye gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten on any woman that he coude aspye; he wolde smyle, and holden it folye, 195 and seye him thus, 'god wot, she slepeth softe for love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte! 29. 'i have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge, ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces, and which a labour folk han in winninge 200 of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces; and whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces; o verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye; ther nis not oon can war by other be.' 30. and with that word he gan cast up the browe, 205 ascaunces , 'lo! is this nought wysly spoken?' at which the god of love gan loken rowe right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken; he kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken; for sodeynly he hit him at the fulle; 210 and yet as proud a pekok can he pulle. 31. o blinde world, o blinde entencioun! how ofte falleth al theffect contraire of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun; for caught is proud , and caught is debonaire. 215 this troilus is clomben on the staire, {160} and litel weneth that he moot descenden. but al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden . 32. as proude bayard ginneth for to skippe out of the wey, so priketh him his corn, 220 til he a lash have of the longe whippe, than thenketh he, 'though i praunce al biforn first in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn, yet am i but an hors, and horses lawe i moot endure, and with my feres drawe.' 225 33. so ferde it by this fers and proude knight; though he a worthy kinges sone were, and wende no-thing hadde had swiche might ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere, yet with a look his herte wex a-fere , 230 that he, that now was most in pryde above, wex sodeynly most subget un-to love. 34. for-thy ensample taketh of this man, ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle, to scornen love, which that so sone can 235 the freedom of your hertes to him thralle; for ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle, that love is he that alle thing may binde; for may no man for-do the lawe of kinde. 35. that this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet; 240 for this trowe i ye knowen, alle or some, men reden not that folk han gretter wit than they that han be most with love y-nome; and strengest folk ben therwith overcome, the worthiest and grettest of degree; 245 this was, and is, and yet men shal it see. 36. and trewelich it sit wel to be so; {161} for alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed; and they that han ben aldermost in wo, with love han ben conforted most and esed; 250 and ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed, and worthy folk maad worthier of name, and causeth most to dreden vyce and shame. 37. now sith it may not goodly be withstonde, and is a thing so vertuous in kinde, 255 refuseth not to love for to be bonde, sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde. the yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde than that that brest; and therfor i yow rede to folwen him that so wel can yow lede. 260 38. but for to tellen forth in special as of this kinges sone of which i tolde, and leten other thing collateral, of him thenke i my tale for to holde, bothe of his ioye, and of his cares colde; 265 and al his werk, as touching this matere, for i it gan, i wil ther-to refere . 39. with-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge, this troilus, of every wight aboute, on this lady and now on that lokinge, 270 wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute: and up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route his eye perced, and so depe it wente, til on criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente. 40. and sodeynly he wex ther-with astoned, 275 and gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse: 'o mercy, god!' thoughte he, 'wher hastow woned, that art so fair and goodly to devyse?' {162} ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse, and softe sighed, lest men mighte him here, 280 and caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere. 41. she nas not with the leste of hir stature, but alle hir limes so wel answeringe weren to womanhode, that creature was neuer lasse mannish in seminge. 285 and eek the pure wyse of here meninge shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse. 42. to troilus right wonder wel with-alle gan for to lyke hir mening and hir chere, 290 which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere, ascaunces , 'what! may i not stonden here?' and after that hir loking gan she lighte, that never thoughte him seen so good a sighte. 295 43. and of hir look in him ther gan to quiken so greet desir, and swich affeccioun, that in his hertes botme gan to stiken of hir his fixe and depe impressioun: and though he erst hadde poured up and doun, 300 he was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke; unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke. 44. lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge, and scorned hem that loves peynes dryen, was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge 305 with-inne the subtile stremes of hir yën; that sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen, right with hir look, the spirit in his herte; blessed be love, that thus can folk converte! {163} 45. she, this in blak, lykinge to troylus, 310 over alle thyng he stood for to biholde; ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus, he neither chere made, ne worde tolde; but from a-fer, his maner for to holde, on other thing his look som-tyme he caste, 315 and eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste. 46. and after this, not fulliche al awhaped , out of the temple al esiliche he wente, repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped of loves folk, lest fully the descente 320 of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente, lest it were wist on any maner syde, his wo he gan dissimulen and hyde. 47. whan he was fro the temple thus departed, he streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth, 325 right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted, al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth; and al his chere and speche also he borneth ; and ay, of loves servants every whyle, him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle. 330 48. and seyde, 'lord, so ye live al in lest, ye loveres! for the conningest of yow, that serveth most ententiflich and best, him tit as often harm ther-of as prow; your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how! 335 nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse; in feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse! 49. in noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces, but it a sely fewe poyntes be; ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces 340 {164} as doth your lay , and that knowe alle ye; but that is not the worste, as mote i thee; but, tolde i yow the worste poynt, i leve, al seyde i sooth, ye wolden at me greve! 50. but tak this , that ye loveres ofte eschuwe, 345 or elles doon of good entencioun, ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue, and deme it harm in hir opinioun; and yet if she, for other enchesoun, be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon: 350 lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!' 51. but for al this, whan that he say his tyme, he held his pees, non other bote him gayned; for love bigan his fetheres so to lyme, that wel unnethe un-to his folk he feyned 355 that othere besye nedes him destrayned; for wo was him, that what to doon he niste, but bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste. 52. and whan that he in chaumbre was allone, he doun up-on his beddes feet him sette, 360 and first he gan to syke, and eft to grone, and thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette, that, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette that he hir saw a temple , and al the wyse right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse. 365 53. thus gan he make a mirour of his minde, in which he saugh al hoolly hir figure; and that he wel coude in his herte finde, it was to him a right good aventure to love swich oon, and if he dide his cure 370 to serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace, or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace. 54. imagininge that travaille nor grame {165} ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn as she, ne him for his desir ne shame, 375 al were it wist, but in prys and up-born of alle lovers wel more than biforn; thus argumented he in his ginninge, ful unavysed of his wo cominge. 55. thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe, 380 and thoughte he wolde werken prively, first , to hyden his desir in muwe from every wight y-born, al-outrely, but he mighte ought recovered be therby; remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe 385 yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe. 56. and over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte what for to speke, and what to holden inne, and what to arten hir to love he soughte, and on a song anoon-right to biginne, 390 and gan loude on his sorwe for to winne; for with good hope he gan fully assente criseyde for to love, and nought repente. 57. and of his song nought only the sentence, as writ myn autour called lollius , 395 but pleynly, save our tonges difference, i dar wel sayn, in al that troilus seyde in his song; lo! every word right thus as i shal seyn; and who-so list it here, lo! next this vers, he may it finden here. cantus troili. 400 58. 'if no love is, o god, what fele i so? and if love is, what thing and whiche is he! {166} if love be good, from whennes comth my wo? if it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me, whenne every torment and adversitee 405 that cometh of him, may to me savory thinke; for ay thurst i, the more that i it drinke. 59. and if that at myn owene lust i brenne, fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte? if harme agree me, wher-to pleyne i thenne? 410 i noot, ne why unwery that i feynte. o quike deeth, o swete harm so queynte, how may of thee in me swich quantitee, but-if that i consente that it be? 60. and if that i consente, i wrongfully 415 compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro, al sterelees with-inne a boot am i a-mid the see, by-twixen windes two, that in contrarie stonden ever-mo. allas! what is this wonder maladye? 420 for hete of cold, for cold of hete, i deye.' 61. and to the god of love thus seyde he with pitous voys, 'o lord, now youres is my spirit, which that oughte youres be. yow thanke i, lord, that han me brought to this; 425 but whether goddesse or womman , y-wis, she be, i noot, which that ye do me serve; but as hir man i wole ay live and sterve. 62. ye stonden in hire eyen mightily, as in a place un-to your vertu digne; 430 wherfore, lord, if my servyse or i {167} may lyke yow, so beth to me benigne; for myn estat royal here i resigne in-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.' 435 63. in him ne deyned sparen blood royal the fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse, ne him forbar in no degree, for al his vertu or his excellent prowesse; but held him as his thral lowe in distresse, 440 and brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe, that sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe. 64. so muche, day by day, his owene thought, for lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese, that every other charge he sette at nought; 445 for-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese, to seen hir goodly look he gan to prese; for ther-by to ben esed wel he wende, and ay the ner he was, the more he brende. 65. for ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is, 450 this, trowe i, knoweth al this companye. but were he fer or neer, i dar seye this, by night or day, for wysdom or folye, his herte, which that is his brestes yë, was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene 455 than ever was eleyne or polixene. 66. eek of the day ther passed nought an houre that to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde, 'good goodly, to whom serve i and laboure, as i best can, now wolde god, criseyde, 460 ye wolden on me rewe er that i deyde! my dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe and lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.' {168} 67. alle othere dredes weren from him fledde , bothe of the assege and his savacioun ; 465 ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde but arguments to this conclusioun, that she on him wolde han compassioun, and he to be hir man, whyl he may dure; lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure! 470 68. the sharpe shoures felle of armes preve, that ector or his othere bretheren diden, ne made him only ther-fore ones meve; and yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden , founde oon the best, and lengest tyme abiden 475 ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle in armes, that to thenke it was mervayle. 69. but for non hate he to the grekes hadde, ne also for the rescous of the toun, ne made him thus in armes for to madde, 480 but only, lo, for this conclusioun, to lyken hir the bet for his renoun; fro day to day in armes so he spedde, that alle the grekes as the deeth him dredde. 70. and fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep, 485 and made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep, it shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe; therfor a title he gan him for to borwe of other syknesse, lest of him men wende 490 that the hote fyr of love him brende. 71. and seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis; but how it was, certayn, can i not seye, if that his lady understood not this, or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye; 495 but wel i rede that, by no maner weye, {169} ne semed it [as] that she of him roughte, nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte. 72. but than fel to this troylus such wo, that he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede 500 was this, that she som wight had loved so, that never of him she wolde have taken hede; for whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede. ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne to tellen it, for al this world to winne. 505 73. but whanne he hadde a space fro his care, thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne; he sayde, 'o fool, now art thou in the snare, that whilom iapedest at loves peyne; now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne; 510 thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende. 74. what wole now every lover seyn of thee, if this be wist, but ever in thyn absence laughen in scorn, and seyn, "lo, ther gooth he, 515 that is the man of so gret sapience, that held us loveres leest in reverence! now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce of hem that love list febly for to avaunce! 75. but, o thou woful troilus, god wolde, 520 sin thow most loven thurgh thy destinee, that thow beset were on swich oon that sholde knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee: but al so cold in love, towardes thee, thy lady is, as frost in winter mone, 525 and thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone." 76. god wolde i were aryved in the port {170} of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede! a, lord, to me it were a greet comfort; then were i quit of languisshing in drede. 530 for by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede i shal bi-iaped been a thousand tyme more than that fool of whos folye men ryme. 77. but now help god, and ye, swete, for whom i pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste! 535 o mercy, dere herte, and help me from the deeth, for i, whyl that my lyf may laste, more than my-self wol love yow to my laste. and with som freendly look gladeth me, swete, though never more thing ye me bi-hete!' 540 78. this wordes and ful manye an-other to he spak, and called ever in his compleynte hir name, for to tellen hir his wo, til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte. al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte; 545 and whan that he bithoughte on that folye, a thousand fold his wo gan multiplye. 79. bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone, a freend of his, that called was pandare, com ones in unwar, and herde him grone, 550 and sey his freend in swich distresse and care: 'allas!' quod he, 'who causeth al this fare? o mercy, god! what unhap may this mene? han now thus sone grekes maad yow lene? 80. or hastow som remors of conscience, 555 and art now falle in som devocioun, and waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence, and hast for ferde caught attricioun ? god save hem that bi-seged han our toun, {171} and so can leye our iolyte on presse , 560 and bring our lusty folk to holinesse !' 81. these wordes seyde he for the nones alle, that with swich thing he mighte him angry maken, and with an angre don his sorwe falle, as for the tyme, and his corage awaken; 565 but wel he wiste, as fer as tonges spaken, ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse than he, ne more desired worthinesse. 82. 'what cas,' quod troilus, 'or what aventure hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge, 570 that am refus of euery creature? but for the love of god, at my preyinge, go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge wol thee disese, and i mot nedes deye; ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye. 575 83. but if thou wene i be thus syk for drede, it is not so, and ther-for scorne nought; ther is a-nother thing i take of hede wel more than ought the grekes han y-wrought, which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought. 580 but though that i now telle thee it ne leste, be thou nought wrooth, i hyde it for the beste.' 84. this pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe, ful often seyde, 'allas! what may this be? now freend,' quod he, 'if ever love or trouthe 585 hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me, ne do thou never swiche a crueltee to hyde fro thy freend so greet a care; wostow nought wel that it am i, pandare? 85. i wole parten with thee al thy peyne, 590 if it be so i do thee no comfort, {172} as it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne, to entreparten wo, as glad desport. i have, and shal, for trewe or fals report, in wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve; 595 hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.' 86. than gan this sorwful troilus to syke, and seyde him thus, 'god leve it be my beste to telle it thee; for, sith it may thee lyke, yet wole i telle it, though myn herte breste; 600 and wel wot i thou mayst do me no reste. but lest thow deme i truste not to thee, now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me. 87. love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth, 605 with desespeir so sorwfully me offendeth, that streyght un-to the deeth myn herte sayleth. ther-to desyr so brenningly me assaylleth, that to ben slayn it were a gretter ioye to me than king of grece been and troye! 610 88. suffiseth this, my fulle freend pandare, that i have seyd, for now wostow my wo; and for the love of god, my colde care so hyd it wel, i telle it never to mo; for harmes mighte folwen, mo than two, 615 if it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse, and lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.' 89. 'how hastow thus unkindely and longe hid this fro me, thou fool?' quod pandarus; 'paraunter thou might after swich oon longe, 620 that myn avys anoon may helpen us.' 'this were a wonder thing,' quod troylus, 'thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse; how devel maystow bringen me to blisse?' {173} 90. 'ye, troilus, now herke,' quod pandare, 625 'though i be nyce; it happeth ofte so, that oon that exces doth ful yvele fare, by good counseyl can kepe his freend ther-fro. i have my-self eek seyn a blind man go ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde; 630 a fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde. 91. a whetston is no kerving instrument, and yet it maketh sharpe kerving-tolis. and ther thow woost that i have ought miswent, eschewe thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is; 635 thus ofte wyse men ben war by folis. if thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared; by his contrarie is every thing declared. 92 . for how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe to him that never tasted bitternesse? 640 ne no man may be inly glad, i trowe, that never was in sorwe or som distresse; eek whyt by blak, by shame eek worthinesse, ech set by other, more for other semeth; as men may see; and so the wyse it demeth. 645 93. sith thus of two contraries is a lore, i, that have in love so ofte assayed grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more counsayllen thee of that thou art amayed . eek thee ne oughte nat ben yvel apayed, 650 though i desyre with thee for to bere thyn hevy charge; it shal the lasse dere. 94. i woot wel that it fareth thus by me as to thy brother parys an herdesse, which that y-cleped was oënone , 655 {174} wrot in a compleynt of hir hevinesse: ye say the lettre that she wroot, y gesse?' nay, never yet, y-wis,' quod troilus.

'o mercy, dere nece,' anoon quod he, 'what-so i spak, i mente nought but weel, by mars the god, that helmed is of steel; now beth nought wrooth, my blood, my nece dere.' 595 'now wel,' quod she, 'foryeven be it here!' 86. with this he took his leve, and hoom he wente; and lord, how he was glad and wel bigoon! criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente, but straught in-to hir closet wente anoon, 600 and sette here doun as stille as any stoon, and every word gan up and doun to winde, that he hadde seyd, as it com hir to minde; 87. and wex somdel astonied in hir thought, right for the newe cas; but whan that she 605 {208} was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought of peril, why she oughte afered be. for man may love, of possibilitee, a womman so, his herte may to-breste, and she nought love ayein, but-if hir leste. 610 88. but as she sat allone and thoughte thus, thascry aroos at skarmish al with-oute, and men cryde in the strete, 'see, troilus hath right now put to flight the grekes route!' with that gan al hir meynee for to shoute, 615 'a! go we see, caste up the latis wyde; for thurgh this strete he moot to palays ryde; 89. for other wey is fro the yate noon of dardanus , ther open is the cheyne.' with that com he and al his folk anoon 620 an esy pas rydinge, in routes tweyne, right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne, for which, men say, may nought disturbed be that shal bityden of necessitee. 90. this troilus sat on his baye stede, 625 al armed, save his heed, ful richely, and wounded was his hors, and gan to blede, on whiche he rood a pas , ful softely; but swych a knightly sighte, trewely, as was on him, was nought, with-outen faile, 630 to loke on mars, that god is of batayle. 91. so lyk a man of armes and a knight he was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse; for bothe he hadde a body and a might to doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse; 635 and eek to seen him in his gere him dresse, so fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he, it was an heven up-on him for to see. {209} 92. his helm to-hewen was in twenty places, that by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde, 640 his sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces, in which men mighte many an arwe finde that thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde ; and ay the peple cryde, 'here cometh our ioye, and, next his brother, holdere up of troye!' 645 93. for which he wex a litel reed for shame, whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen, that to biholde it was a noble game, how sobreliche he caste doun his yën. cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen, 650 and leet so softe it in hir herte sinke, that to hir-self she seyde, 'who yaf me drinke ?' 94. for of hir owene thought she wex al reed, remembringe hir right thus, 'lo, this is he which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed, 655 but i on him have mercy and pitee;' and with that thought, for pure a-shamed , she gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste, whyl he and al the peple for-by paste, 95. and gan to caste and rollen up and doun 660 with-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse, and his estat, and also his renoun, his wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse; but most hir favour was, for his distresse was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe 665 to sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe. 96. now mighte som envyous iangle thus, 'this was a sodeyn love, how mighte it be that she so lightly lovede troilus right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?' 670 now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee! {210} for every thing, a ginning hath it nede er al be wrought, with-outen any drede. 97. for i sey nought that she so sodeynly yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne 675 to lyke him first, and i have told yow why; and after that, his manhod and his pyne made love with-inne hir for to myne, for which, by proces and by good servyse, he gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse. 680 98. and also blisful venus, wel arayed, sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho, disposed wel, and with aspectes payed, to helpen sely troilus of his wo. and, sooth to seyn, she nas nat al a fo 685 to troilus in his nativitee; god woot that wel the soner spedde he. 99. now lat us stinte of troilus a throwe, that rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste un-to criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe, 690 ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste, if it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse, for troilus, up-on hir for to presse. 100. and, lord! so she gan in hir thought argue 695 in this matere of which i have yow told, and what to doon best were, and what eschue, that plyted she ful ofte in many fold. now was hir herte warm, now was it cold, and what she thoughte somwhat shal i wryte, 700 as to myn auctor listeth for to endyte. 101. she thoughte wel, that troilus persone she knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse, {211} and thus she seyde, 'al were it nought to done, to graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse, 705 it were honour, with pley and with gladnesse, in honestee, with swich a lord to dele, for myn estat, and also for his hele. 102. eek, wel wot i my kinges sone is he; and sith he hath to see me swich delyt, 710 if i wolde utterly his sighte flee, paraunter he mighte have me in dispyt, thurgh which i mighte stonde in worse plyt; now were i wys, me hate to purchace, with-outen nede, ther i may stonde in grace? 715 103. in every thing, i woot, ther lyth mesure. for though a man forbede dronkenesse, he nought for-bet that every creature be drinkelees for alwey, as i gesse; eek sith i woot for me is his distresse, 720 i ne oughte not for that thing him despyse, sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse. 104. and eek i knowe, of longe tyme agoon, his thewes goode, and that he is not nyce. ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, is he noon; 725 to wys is he to do so gret a vyce; ne als i nel him never so cheryce, that he may make avaunt, by iuste cause; he shal me never binde in swiche a clause. 105. now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis, 730 men mighten deme that he loveth me: what dishonour were it un-to me, this? may i him lette of that? why nay, pardee! i knowe also, and alday here and see, {212} men loven wommen al this toun aboute; 735 be they the wers? why, nay, with-outen doute. 106. i thenk eek how he able is for to have of al this noble toun the thriftieste, to been his love, so she hir honour save; for out and out he is the worthieste, 740 save only ector, which that is the beste. and yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure, but swich is love, and eek myn aventure. 107. ne me to love, a wonder is it nought; for wel wot i my-self, so god me spede, 745 al wolde i that noon wistë of this thought, i am oon the fayreste , out of drede, and goodlieste, who-so taketh hede; and so men seyn in al the toun of troye. what wonder is it though he of me have ioye? 750 108. i am myn owene woman , wel at ese, i thank it god, as after myn estat; right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese , with-outen ialousye or swich debat; shal noon housbonde seyn to me "chekmat!" 755 for either they ben ful of ialousye, or maisterful, or loven novelrye. 109. what shal i doon? to what fyn live i thus? shal i nat loven, in cas if that me leste? what, par dieux ! i am nought religious ! 760 and though that i myn herte sette at reste upon this knight, that is the worthieste, {213} and kepe alwey myn honour and my name, by alle right, it may do me no shame.' 110. but right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte, 765 in march, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face, and that a cloud is put with wind to flighte which over-sprat the sonne as for a space, a cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace, that over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle, 770 so that for fere almost she gan to falle. 111. that thought was this, 'allas! sin i am free, sholde i now love, and putte in iupartye my sikernesse, and thrallen libertee? allas! how dorste i thenken that folye? 775 may i nought wel in other folk aspye hir dredful ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne? ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne. 112. for love is yet the moste stormy lyf, right of him-self, that ever was bigonne; 780 for ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf, ther is in love, som cloud is over the sonne: ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne, whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke; our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke . 785 113. also these wikked tonges been so prest to speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe, that, right anoon as cessed is hir lest, so cesseth love, and forth to love a newe: but harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe. 790 for though these men for love hem first to-rende, ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende. 114. how ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be, the treson, that to womman hath be do? {214} to what fyn is swich love, i can nat see, 795 or wher bicomth it, whan it is ago; ther is no wight that woot, i trowe so, wher it bycomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth ; that erst was no-thing, in-to nought it torneth. 115. how bisy, if i love, eek moste i be 800 to plesen hem that iangle of love, and demen, and coye hem, that they sey non harm of me? for though ther be no cause, yet hem semen al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen ; and who may stoppen every wikked tonge, 805 or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?' 116. and after that, hir thought bigan to clere, and seyde, 'he which that no-thing under-taketh , no-thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.' and with an other thought hir herte quaketh; 810 than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh; now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye, she rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye. 117. adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente in-to the gardin, with hir neces three, 815 and up and doun ther made many a wente, flexippe, she, tharbe, and antigone, to pleyen, that it ioye was to see; and othere of hir wommen, a gret route, hir folwede in the gardin al aboute. 820 118. this yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes, and shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene, and benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes, in which she walketh arm in arm bi-twene; til at the laste antigone the shene 825 gan on a troian song to singe clere, that it an heven was hir voys to here.— {215} 119. she seyde, 'o love, to whom i have and shal ben humble subgit, trewe in myn entente, as i best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al 830 for ever-more, myn hertes lust to rente . for never yet thy grace no wight sente so blisful cause as me, my lyf to lede in alle ioye and seurtee, out of drede. 120. ye, blisful god, han me so wel beset 835 in love, y-wis, that al that bereth lyf imaginen ne cowde how to ben bet; for, lord, with-outen ialousye or stryf, i love oon which that is most ententyf to serven wel, unwery or unfeyned, 840 that ever was, and leest with harm distreyned. 121. as he that is the welle of worthinesse, of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed, of wit appollo, stoon of sikernesse, of vertu rote, of lust findere and heed, 845 thurgh which is alle sorwe fro me deed, y-wis, i love him best, so doth he me; now good thrift have he, wher-so that he be!

lo, here is she that is your deeth to wyte.' 10. ther-with it semed as he wepte almost; 65 'a ha,' quod troilus so rewfully, 'wher me be wo, o mighty god, thou wost! who is al there? i see nought trewely.' 'sire,' quod criseyde, 'it is pandare and i.' 'ye, swete herte? allas, i may nought ryse 70 to knele, and do yow honour in som wyse.' 11. and dressede him upward, and she right tho gan bothe here hondes softe upon him leye, 'o, for the love of god, do ye not so to me,' quod she, 'ey! what is this to seye? 75 sire, come am i to yow for causes tweye; first, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe eke continuaunce i wolde yow biseke.' 12. this troilus, that herde his lady preye of lordship him, wex neither quik ne deed, 80 ne mighte a word for shame to it seye, al-though men sholde smyten of his heed. but lord, so he wex sodeinliche reed, and sire, his lesson, that he wende conne, to preyen hir, is thurgh his wit y-ronne. 85 13. cryseyde al this aspyede wel y-nough, for she was wys, and lovede him never-the-lasse, {247} al nere he malapert , or made it tough, or was to bold, to singe a fool a masse. but whan his shame gan somwhat to passe, 90 his resons, as i may my rymes holde, i yow wol telle, as techen bokes olde. 14. in chaunged vois, right for his verrey drede, which vois eek quook, and ther-to his manere goodly abayst, and now his hewes rede, 95 now pale, un-to criseyde, his lady dere, with look doun cast and humble yolden chere, lo, the alderfirste word that him asterte was, twyes, 'mercy, mercy, swete herte!' 15. and stinte a whyl, and whan he mighte out-bringe, 100 the nexte word was, 'god wot, for i have, as feythfully as i have had konninge, ben youres, also god my sowle save; and shal, til that i, woful wight, be grave. and though i dar ne can un-to yow pleyne, 105 y-wis, i suffre nought the lasse peyne. 16. thus muche as now, o wommanliche wyf, i may out-bringe, and if this yow displese, that shal i wreke upon myn owne lyf right sone, i trowe, and doon your herte an ese, 110 if with my deeth your herte i may apese. but sin that ye han herd me som-what seye, now recche i never how sone that i deye.' 17. ther-with his manly sorwe to biholde, it mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe; 115 and pandare weep as he to watre wolde , and poked ever his nece newe and newe, and seyde, 'wo bigon ben hertes trewe! for love of god, make of this thing an ende, or slee us bothe at ones, er that ye wende.' 120 {248} 18. 'i? what?' quod she, 'by god and by my trouthe, i noot nought what ye wilne that i seye.' 'i? what?' quod he, 'that ye han on him routhe, for goddes love, and doth him nought to deye.' 'now thanne thus,' quod she, 'i wolde him preye 125 to telle me the fyn of his entente; yet wiste i never wel what that he mente.' 19. 'what that i mene, o swete herte dere?' quod troilus, 'o goodly fresshe free! that, with the stremes of your eyen clere, 130 ye wolde som-tyme freendly on me see, and thanne agreën that i may ben he, with-oute braunche of vyce in any wyse, in trouthe alwey to doon yow my servyse 20. as to my lady right and chief resort, 135 with al my wit and al my diligence, and i to han , right as yow list, comfort, under your yerde, egal to myn offence, as deeth, if that i breke your defence; and that ye deigne me so muche honoure, 140 me to comaunden ought in any houre. 21. and i to ben your verray humble trewe, secret, and in my paynes pacient, and ever-mo desire freshly newe, to serven, and been y-lyke ay diligent, 145 and, with good herte, al holly your talent receyven wel, how sore that me smerte, lo, this mene i, myn owene swete herte.' 22. quod pandarus, 'lo, here an hard request, and resonable, a lady for to werne! 150 now, nece myn, by natal ioves fest , {249} were i a god, ye sholde sterve as yerne, that heren wel, this man wol no-thing yerne but your honour, and seen him almost sterve, and been so looth to suffren him yow serve.' 155 23. with that she gan hir eyen on him caste ful esily, and ful debonairly, avysing hir, and hyed not to faste with never a word, but seyde him softely, 'myn honour sauf, i wol wel trewely, 160 and in swich forme as he can now devyse, receyven him fully to my servyse, 24. biseching him, for goddes love, that he wolde, in honour of trouthe and gentilesse, as i wel mene, eek mene wel to me, 165 and myn honour, with wit and besinesse, ay kepe; and if i may don him gladnesse, from hennes-forth, y-wis, i nil not feyne: now beeth al hool, no lenger ye ne pleyne. 25. but nathelees, this warne i yow,' quod she, 170 'a kinges sone al-though ye be, y-wis, ye shul na-more have soverainetee of me in love, than right in that cas is; ne i nil forbere, if that ye doon a-mis, to wrathen yow; and whyl that ye me serve, 175 cherycen yow right after ye deserve. 26. and shortly, derë herte and al my knight, beth glad, and draweth yow to lustinesse, and i shal trewely, with al my might, your bittre tornen al in-to swetnesse; 180 if i be she that may yow do gladnesse, for every wo ye shal recovere a blisse'; and him in armes took, and gan him kisse. 27. fil pandarus on knees, and up his yën to hevene threw, and held his hondes hye, 185 {250} 'immortal god!' quod he, 'that mayst nought dyen, cupide i mene, of this mayst glorifye; and venus, thou mayst make melodye; with-outen hond, me semeth that in towne, for this merveyle, i here ech belle sowne . 190 28. but ho! no more as now of this matere, for-why this folk wol comen up anoon, that han the lettre red; lo, i hem here. but i coniure thee, criseyde, and oon , and two , thou troilus, whan thow mayst goon, 195 that at myn hous ye been at my warninge, for i ful wel shal shape your cominge; 29. and eseth ther your hertes right y-nough; and lat see which of yow shal bere the belle to speke of love a-right!' ther-with he lough, 200 'for ther have ye a layser for to telle.' quod troilus, 'how longe shal i dwelle er this be doon?' quod he, 'whan thou mayst ryse, this thing shal be right as i yow devyse.' 30. with that eleyne and also deiphebus 205 tho comen upward, right at the steyres ende; and lord, so than gan grone troilus, his brother and his suster for to blende. quod pandarus, 'it tyme is that we wende; tak, nece myn, your leve at alle three, 210 and lat hem speke, and cometh forth with me.' 31. she took hir leve at hem ful thriftily, as she wel coude, and they hir reverence un-to the fulle diden hardely, and speken wonder wel, in hir absence, 215 of hir, in preysing of hir excellence, {251} hir governaunce, hir wit; and hir manere commendeden, it ioye was to here. 32. now lat hir wende un-to hir owne place, and torne we to troilus a-yein, 220 that gan ful lightly of the lettre passe, that deiphebus hadde in the gardin seyn. and of eleyne and him he wolde fayn delivered been, and seyde, that him leste to slepe, and after tales have reste. 225 33. eleyne him kiste, and took hir leve blyve, deiphebus eek, and hoom wente every wight; and pandarus, as faste as he may dryve, to troilus tho com, as lyne right ; and on a paillet, al that glade night, 230 by troilus he lay, with mery chere, to tale; and wel was hem they were y-fere. 34. whan every wight was voided but they two, and alle the dores were faste y-shette, to telle in short, with-oute wordes mo, 235 this pandarus, with-outen any lette, up roos, and on his beddes syde him sette, and gan to speken in a sobre wyse to troilus, as i shal yow devyse. 35. 'myn alderlevest lord, and brother dere, 240 god woot, and thou, that it sat me so sore, when i thee saw so languisshing to-yere, for love, of which thy wo wex alwey more; that i, with al my might and al my lore, have ever sithen doon my bisinesse 245 to bringe thee to ioye out of distresse; 36. and have it brought to swich plyt as thou wost, so that, thorugh me, thow stondest now in weye to fare wel, i seye it for no bost, and wostow why? for shame it is to seye, 250 {252} for thee have i bigonne a gamen pleye which that i never doon shal eft for other, al-though he were a thousand fold my brother. 37. that is to seye, for thee am i bicomen, bitwixen game and ernest, swich a mene 255 as maken wommen un-to men to comen; al sey i nought, thou wost wel what i mene. for thee have i my nece, of vyces clene, so fully maad thy gentilesse triste, that al shal been right as thy-selve liste. 260 38. but god, that al wot, take i to witnesse, that never i this for coveityse wroughte, but only for to abregge that distresse, for which wel nygh thou deydest, as me thoughte. but gode brother, do now as thee oughte, 265 for goddes love, and keep hir out of blame, sin thou art wys, and save alwey hir name. 39. for wel thou wost, the name as yet of here among the peple, as who seyth, halwed is; for that man is unbore, i dar wel swere, 270 that ever wiste that she dide amis. but wo is me, that i, that cause al this, may thenken that she is my nece dere, and i hir eem, and traytor eek y-fere! 40. and were it wist that i, through myn engyn, 275 hadde in my nece y-put this fantasye, to do thy lust, and hoolly to be thyn, why, al the world up-on it wolde crye, and seye, that i the worste trecherye dide in this cas, that ever was bigonne, 280 and she for-lost, and thou right nought y-wonne. 41. wher-fore, er i wol ferther goon a pas, yet eft i thee biseche and fully seye, {253} that privetee go with us in this cas, that is to seye, that thou us never wreye; 285 and be nought wrooth, though i thee ofte preye to holden secree swich an heigh matere; for skilful is, thow wost wel, my preyere. 42. and thenk what wo ther hath bitid er this, for makinge of avauntes, as men rede; 290 and what mischaunce in this world yet ther is, fro day to day, right for that wikked dede; for which these wyse clerkes that ben dede han ever yet proverbed to us yonge, that "firste vertu is to kepe tonge." 295 43. and, nere it that i wilne as now tabregge diffusioun of speche, i coude almost a thousand olde stories thee alegge of wommen lost, thorugh fals and foles bost; proverbes canst thy-self y-nowe, and wost, 300 ayeins that vyce, for to been a labbe, al seyde men sooth as often as they gabbe. 44. o tonge, allas! so often here-biforn hastow made many a lady bright of hewe seyd, "welawey! the day that i was born!" 305 and many a maydes sorwes for to newe; and, for the more part, al is untrewe that men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve; of kinde non avauntour is to leve . 45. avauntour and a lyere, al is on; 310 as thus: i pose, a womman graunte me hir love, and seyth that other wol she non, and i am sworn to holden it secree, and after i go telle it two or three; y-wis, i am avauntour at the leste, 315 and lyere, for i breke my biheste. {254} 46. now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame, swich maner folk; what shal i clepe hem, what, that hem avaunte of wommen, and by name, that never yet bihighte hem this ne that, 320 ne knewe hem more than myn olde hat? no wonder is, so god me sende hele, though wommen drede with us men to dele. 47. i sey not this for no mistrust of yow, ne for no wys man, but for foles nyce, 325 and for the harm that in the world is now, as wel for foly ofte as for malyce; for wel wot i, in wyse folk, that vyce no womman drat , if she be wel avysed; for wyse ben by foles harm chastysed. 330 48. but now to purpos; leve brother dere, have al this thing that i have seyd in minde, and keep thee clos, and be now of good chere, for at thy day thou shalt me trewe finde. i shal thy proces sette in swich a kinde, 335 and god to-forn, that it shall thee suffyse, for it shal been right as thou wolt devyse. 49. for wel i woot, thou menest wel, parde; therfore i dar this fully undertake. thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee, 340 and day is set , the chartres up to make. have now good night, i may no lenger wake; and bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse, that god me sende deeth or sone lisse.' 50. who mighte telle half the ioye or feste 345 which that the sowle of troilus tho felte, heringe theffect of pandarus biheste? his olde wo, that made his herte swelte, gan tho for ioye wasten and to-melte, {255} and al the richesse of his sykes sore 350 at ones fledde, he felte of hem no more. 51. but right so as these holtes and these hayes, that han in winter dede been and dreye, revesten hem in grene, whan that may is, whan every lusty lyketh best to pleye: 355 right in that selve wyse, sooth to seye, wex sodeynliche his herte ful of ioye, that gladder was ther never man in troye. 52. and gan his look on pandarus up caste ful sobrely, and frendly for to see, 360 and seyde, 'freend, in aprille the laste, as wel thou wost, if it remembre thee, how neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me; and how thou didest al thy bisinesse to knowe of me the cause of my distresse. 365 53. thou wost how longe i it for-bar to seye to thee, that art the man that i best triste; and peril was it noon to thee by-wreye, that wiste i wel; but tel me, if thee liste, sith i so looth was that thy-self it wiste, 370 how dorste i mo tellen of this matere, that quake now, and no wight may us here? 54. but natheles, by that god i thee swere, that, as him list, may al this world governe, and, if i lye, achilles with his spere 375 myn herte cleve, al were my lyf eterne, as i am mortal, if i late or yerne wolde it biwreye, or dorste , or sholde conne, for al the good that god made under sonne; 55. that rather deye i wolde, and determyne, 380 as thinketh me, now stokked in presoun, {256} in wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermyne, caytif to cruel king agamenoun; and this, in alle the temples of this toun, upon the goddes alle, i wol thee swere, 385 to-morwe day, if that thee lyketh here. 56. and that thou hast so muche y-doon for me, that i ne may it never-more deserve, this knowe i wel, al mighte i now for thee a thousand tymes on a morwen sterve, 390 i can no more, but that i wol thee serve right as thy sclave, whider-so thou wende, for ever-more, un-to my lyves ende! 57. but here, with al myn herte, i thee biseche, that never in me thou deme swich folye 395 as i shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche, that this, which thou me dost for companye, i sholde wene it were a bauderye; i am nought wood, al-if i lewed be; it is not so, that wool i wel, pardee. 400 58. but he that goth, for gold or for richesse, on swich message, calle him what thee list; and this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse, compassioun, and felawship, and trist; departe it so , for wyde-where is wist 405 how that there is dyversitee requered bitwixen thinges lyke, as i have lered. 59. and, that thou knowe i thenke nought ne wene that this servyse a shame be or iape, i have my faire suster polixene, 410 cassandre, eleyne, or any of the frape ; be she never so faire or wel y-shape, {257} tel me, which thou wilt of everichone, to han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone. 60. but sin that thou hast don me this servyse, 415 my lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede, so, for the love of god, this grete empryse parforme it out; for now is moste nede. for high and low, with-outen any drede, i wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe; 420 have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.' 61. thus held him ech with other wel apayed, that al the world ne mighte it bet amende; and, on the morwe, whan they were arayed, ech to his owene nedes gan entende. 425 but troilus, though as the fyr he brende for sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce, he not for-gat his gode governaunce. 62. but in him-self with manhod gan restreyne ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere, 430 that alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne, ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere, what that he mente, as touching this matere. from every wight as fer as is the cloude he was, so wel dissimulen he coude. 435 63. and al the whyl which that i yow devyse, this was his lyf; with al his fulle might, by day he was in martes high servyse, this is to seyn, in armes as a knight; and for the more part, the longe night 440 he lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve his lady best, hir thank for to deserve. 64. nil i nought swerë, al-though he lay softe, that in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed, {258} ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte, 445 and wolde of that him missed han ben sesed ; but in swich cas man is nought alwey plesed, for ought i wot, no more than was he; that can i deme of possibilitee. 65. but certeyn is, to purpos for to go, 450 that in this whyle, as writen is in geste, he say his lady som-tyme; and also she with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste, and by hir bothe avys, as was the beste, apoynteden ful warly in this nede, 455 so as they dorste, how they wolde procede. 66. but it was spoken in so short a wyse, in swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere, lest any wyght divynen or devyse wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere, 460 that al this world so leef to hem ne were as that cupido wolde hem grace sende to maken of hir speche aright an ende. 67. but thilke litel that they speke or wroughte, his wyse goost took ay of al swich hede, 465 it semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte with-outen word, so that it was no nede to bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede; for which she thoughte that love, al come it late, of alle ioye hadde opned hir the yate. 470 68. and shortly of this proces for to pace, so wel his werk and wordes he bisette, that he so ful stood in his lady grace, that twenty thousand tymes, or she lette, she thonked god she ever with him mette; 475 so coude he him governe in swich servyse, that al the world ne mighte it bet devyse. {259} 69. for-why she fond him so discreet in al, so secret, and of swich obëisaunce, that wel she felte he was to hir a wal 480 of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce; that, to ben in his gode governaunce, so wys he was, she was no more afered, i mene, as fer as oughte ben requered. 70. and pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr, 485 was ever y-lyke prest and diligent; to ese his frend was set al his desyr. he shof ay on, he to and fro was sent; he lettres bar whan troilus was absent. that never man, as in his freendes nede, 490 ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede. 71. but now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde that every word, or sonde, or look, or chere of troilus that i rehersen sholde, in al this whyle, un-to his lady dere;

500 and though i wolde i coude not, y-wis; for ther was som epistel hem bitwene, that wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte; how sholde i thanne a lyne of it endyte? 505 73. but to the grete effect: than sey i thus, that stonding in concord and in quiete thise ilke two, criseyde and troilus, as i have told, and in this tyme swete, save only often mighte they not mete, 510 {260} ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle , that it befel right as i shal yow telle, 74. that pandarus, that ever dide his might right for the fyn that i shal speke of here, as for to bringe to his hous som night 515 his faire nece, and troilus y-fere, wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere, touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde, hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde. 75. for he with greet deliberacioun 520 hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle forn-cast, and put in execucioun, and neither laft, for cost ne for travayle; come if hem lest, hem sholde no-thing fayle; and for to been in ought espyed there, 525 that, wiste he wel, an inpossible were. 76. dredelees, it cleer was in the wind of every pye and every lette-game;

ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente. 80. whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye 555 as he was wont, and of him-self to iape; and fynally, he swor and gan hir seye, by this and that, she sholde him not escape, ne lengere doon him after hir to gape; but certeynly she moste, by hir leve, 560 come soupen in his hous with him at eve. 81. at whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse, and seyde, 'it rayneth; lo, how sholde i goon?' 'lat be,' quod he, 'ne stond not thus to muse; this moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.' 565 so at the laste her-of they felle at oon, or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere, he nolde never come ther she were. 82. sone after this, to him she gan to rowne, and asked him if troilus were there? 570 he swor hir, 'nay, for he was out of towne,' and seyde, 'nece, i pose that he were, yow thurfte never have the more fere. for rather than men mighte him ther aspye, me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.' 575 {262} 83. nought list myn auctor fully to declare what that she thoughte whan he seyde so, that troilus was out of town y-fare, as if he seyde ther-of sooth or no; but that, with-oute awayt, with him to go, 580 she graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte, and, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte. 84. but nathelees, yet gan she him biseche, al-though with him to goon it was no fere, for to be war of goosish peples speche, 585 that dremen thinges whiche that never were, and wel avyse him whom he broughte there; and seyde him, 'eem, sin i mot on yow triste, loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.' 85. he swor hir, 'yis, by stokkes and by stones, 590 and by the goddes that in hevene dwelle, or elles were him lever, soule and bones, with pluto king as depe been in helle as tantalus!' what sholde i more telle? whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve, 595 and she to souper com, whan it was eve, 86. with a certayn of hir owene men, and with hir faire nece antigone, and othere of hir wommen nyne or ten; but who was glad now, who, as trowe ye, 600 but troilus, that stood and mighte it see thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe , ther he bishet , sin midnight, was in mewe, 87. unwist of every wight but of pandare? but to the poynt; now whan she was y-come 605 {263} with alle ioye, and alle frendes fare, hir eem anoon in armes hath hir nome, and after to the souper, alle and some, whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette; god wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette . 610 88. and after souper gonnen they to ryse, at ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade, and wel was him that coude best devyse to lyken hir, or that hir laughen made. he song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of wade . 615 but at the laste, as every thing hath ende, she took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende. 89 . but o, fortune, executrice of wierdes, o influences of thise hevenes hye! soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes, 620 though to us bestes been the causes wrye. this mene i now, for she gan hoomward hye, but execut was al bisyde hir leve , at the goddes wil; for which she moste bleve. 90. the bente mone with hir hornes pale, 625 saturne, and iove, in cancro ioyned were, that swich a rayn from hevene gan avale, that every maner womman that was there hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere; at which pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne, 630 'now were it tyme a lady to go henne! 91. but goode nece, if i mighte ever plese yow any-thing, than prey i yow,' quod he, 'to doon myn herte as now so greet an ese as for to dwelle here al this night with me, 635 for-why this is your owene hous, pardee. {264} for, by my trouthe, i sey it nought a-game, to wende as now, it were to me a shame.' 92. criseyde, whiche that coude as muche good as half a world, tok hede of his preyere; 640 and sin it ron , and al was on a flood, she thoughte, as good chep may i dwellen here, and graunte it gladly with a freendes chere, and have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde; for hoom to goon it may nought wel bityde. 645 93.

217. beth glad for-thy, and live in sikernesse; thus seyde i never er this, ne shal to mo ; 1515 and if to yow it were a gret gladnesse to turne ayein, soone after that ye go, as fayn wolde i as ye, it were so, as wisly god myn herte bringe at reste!' and him in armes took, and ofte keste. 1520 218. agayns his wil, sin it mot nedes be, this troilus up roos, and faste him cledde, {292} and in his armes took his lady free an hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde, and with swich wordes as his herte bledde, 1525 he seyde, 'farewel, my dere herte swete, ther god us graunte sounde and sone to mete!' 219. to which no word for sorwe she answerde, so sore gan his parting hir destreyne; and troilus un-to his palays ferde, 1530 as woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne; so hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne for to ben eft there he was in plesaunce, that it may never out of his remembraunce. 220. retorned to his real palais, sone 1535 he softe in-to his bed gan for to slinke, to slepe longe, as he was wont to done, but al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke, but sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke; thenkinge how she, for whom desyr him brende, 1540 a thousand-fold was worth more than he wende. 221. and in his thought gan up and doun to winde hir wordes alle, and every contenaunce, and fermely impressen in his minde the leste poynt that to him was plesaunce; 1545 and verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce, desyr al newe him brende , and lust to brede gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede. 222. criseyde also, right in the same wyse, of troilus gan in hir herte shette 1550 his worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wyse, his gentilesse, and how she with him mette, thonkinge love he so wel hir bisette; desyring eft to have hir herte dere in swich a plyt, she dorste make him chere. 1555 {293} 223. pandare, a-morwe which that comen was un-to his nece, and gan hir fayre grete, seyde, 'al this night so reyned it, allas! that al my drede is that ye, nece swete, han litel layser had to slepe and mete; 1560 al night,' quod he, 'hath reyn so do me wake, that som of us, i trowe, hir hedes ake.' 224. and ner he com, and seyde, 'how stont it now this mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?' criseyde answerde, 'never the bet for yow, 1565 fox that ye been, god yeve your herte care! god helpe me so, ye caused al this fare, trow i,' quod she, 'for alle your wordes whyte; o! who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!' 225. with that she gan hir face for to wrye 1570 with the shete, and wex for shame al reed; and pandarus gan under for to prye, and seyde, 'nece, if that i shal ben deed, have here a swerd, and smyteth of myn heed.' with that his arm al sodeynly he thriste 1575 under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste. 226. i passe al that which chargeth nought to seye, what! god foryaf his deeth , and she al-so foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye, for other cause was ther noon than so. 1580 but of this thing right to the effect to go, whan tyme was, hom til hir hous she wente, and pandarus hath fully his entente. 227. now torne we ayein to troilus, that resteles ful longe a-bedde lay, 1585 {294} and prevely sente after pandarus, to him to come in al the haste he may. he com anoon, nought ones seyde he 'nay,' and troilus ful sobrely he grette, and doun upon his beddes syde him sette. 1590 228. this troilus, with al the affeccioun of frendes love that herte may devyse, to pandarus on kneës fil adoun, and er that he wolde of the place aryse, he gan him thonken in his beste wyse; 1595 a hondred sythe he gan the tyme blesse, that he was born to bringe him fro distresse. 229. he seyde, 'o frend, of frendes the alderbeste that ever was, the sothe for to telle, thou hast in hevene y-brought my soule at reste 1600 fro flegiton , the fery flood of helle; that, though i mighte a thousand tymes selle, upon a day, my lyf in thy servyse, it mighte nought a mote in that suffyse. 230. the sonne, which that al the world may see, 1605 saw never yet, my lyf, that dar i leye, so inly fair and goodly as is she, whos i am al, and shal, til that i deye; and, that i thus am hires, dar i seye, that thanked be the heighe worthinesse 1610 of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse. 231. thus hastow me no litel thing y-yive, fo which to thee obliged be for ay my lyf, and why? for thorugh thyn help i live; for elles deed hadde i be many a day.' 1615 and with that word doun in his bed he lay, {295} and pandarus ful sobrely him herde til al was seyd, and thanne he him answerde: 232. 'my dere frend, if i have doon for thee in any cas, god wot, it is me leef; 1620 and am as glad as man may of it be, god help me so; but tak now not a-greef that i shal seyn, be war of this myscheef, that, there-as thou now brought art in-to blisse, that thou thy-self ne cause it nought to misse. 1625 233 . for of fortunes sharp adversitee the worst kinde of infortune is this, a man to have ben in prosperitee, and it remembren, whan it passed is. thou art wys y-nough, for-thy do nought amis; 1630 be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme, for if thou be, certeyn, it wol thee harme. 234. thou art at ese, and holde thee wel ther-inne. for also seur as reed is every fyr, as greet a craft is kepe wel as winne; 1635 brydle alwey wel thy speche and thy desyr. for worldly ioye halt not but by a wyr; that preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte; for-thy nede is to werke with it softe.' 235. quod troilus, 'i hope, and god to-forn, 1640 my dere frend, that i shal so me bere, that in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn, ne i nil not rakle as for to greven here; it nedeth not this matere ofte tere; for wistestow myn herte wel, pandare, 1645 god woot, of this thou woldest litel care.' 236. tho gan he telle him of his glade night. and wher-of first his herte dredde, and how, {296} and seyde, 'freend, as i am trewe knight, and by that feyth i shal to god and yow, 1650 i hadde it never half so hote as now; and ay the more that desyr me byteth to love hir best, the more it me delyteth. 237. i noot my-self not wisly what it is; but now i fele a newe qualitee, 1655 ye, al another than i dide er this.' pandare answerde, and seyde thus, that he that ones may in hevene blisse be, he feleth other weyes, dar i leye, than thilke tyme he first herde of it seye. 1660 238. this is o word for al; this troilus was never ful, to speke of this matere, and for to preysen un-to pandarus the bountee of his righte lady dere, and pandarus to thanke and maken chere. 1665 this tale ay was span-newe to biginne til that the night departed hem a-twinne. 239. sone after this, for that fortune it wolde, i-comen was the blisful tyme swete, that troilus was warned that he sholde, 1670 ther he was erst, criseyde his lady mete; for which he felte his herte in ioye flete; and feythfully gan alle the goddes herie; and lat see now if that he can be merie. 240. and holden was the forme and al the wyse, 1675 of hir cominge, and eek of his also, as it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse. but playnly to the effect right for to go, in ioye and seurte pandarus hem two a-bedde broughte, whan hem bothe leste, 1680 and thus they ben in quiete and in reste. {297} 241. nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met, to aske at me if that they blythe were; for if it erst was wel, tho was it bet a thousand-fold, this nedeth not enquere. 1685 a-gon was every sorwe and every fere; and bothe, y-wis, they hadde, and so they wende, as muche ioye as herte may comprende . 242. this is no litel thing of for to seye, this passeth every wit for to devyse; 1690 for eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye; felicitee, which that thise clerkes wyse commenden so, ne may not here suffyse. this ioye may not writen been with inke, this passeth al that herte may bithinke. 1695 243. but cruel day, so wel-awey the stounde! gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe, for whiche hem thoughte felen dethes wounde; so wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe, and day they gonnen to dispyse al newe, 1700 calling it traytour, envyous, and worse, and bitterly the dayes light they curse. 244. quod troilus, 'allas! now am i war that pirous and tho swifte stedes three, whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char, 1705 han goon som by-path in despyt of me; that maketh it so sone day to be; and, for the sonne him hasteth thus to ryse, ne shal i never doon him sacrifyse!' 245. but nedes day departe moste hem sone, 1710 and whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere, {298} they twinne anoon as they were wont to done, and setten tyme of meting eft y-fere; and many a night they wroughte in this manere. and thus fortune a tyme ladde in ioye 1715 criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of troye. 246. in suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges, this troilus gan al his lyf to lede; he spendeth, iusteth, maketh festeyinges; he yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede, 1720 and held aboute him alwey, out of drede, a world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde, the fressheste and the beste he coude fynde; 247. that swich a voys was of hym and a stevene thorugh-out the world, of honour and largesse, 1725 that it up rong un-to the yate of hevene. and, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse, that in his herte he demede, as i gesse, that there nis lovere in this world at ese so wel as he, and thus gan love him plese. 1730 248. the godlihede or beautee which that kinde in any other lady hadde y-set can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde, a-boute his herte, of al criseydes net. he was so narwe y-masked and y-knet, 1735 that it undon on any manere syde, that nil not been, for ought that may betyde. 249. and by the hond ful ofte he wolde take this pandarus, and in-to gardin lede, and swich a feste and swich a proces make 1740 him of criseyde, and of hir womanhede, and of hir beautee, that, with-outen drede, {299} it was an hevene his wordes for to here; and thanne he wolde singe in this manere. 250 . 'love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce, 1745 love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye, love, that with an holsom alliaunce halt peples ioyned, as him list hem gye, love, that knetteth lawe of companye, and couples doth in vertu for to dwelle, 1750 bind this acord, that i have told and telle; 251. that that the world with feyth, which that is stable, dyverseth so his stoundes concordinge, that elements that been so discordable holden a bond perpetuely duringe, 1755 that phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe, and that the mone hath lordship over the nightes, al this doth love; ay heried be his mightes! 252. that that the see, that gredy is to flowen, constreyneth to a certeyn ende so 1760 his flodes, that so fersly they ne growen to drenchen erthe and al for ever-mo; and if that love ought lete his brydel go, al that now loveth a-sonder sholde lepe, and lost were al, that love halt now to-hepe . 1765 253. so wolde god, that auctor is of kinde, that, with his bond, love of his vertu liste to cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde, that from his bond no wight the wey out wiste. and hertes colde, hem wolde i that he twiste 1770 {300} to make hem love, and that hem leste ay rewe on hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.' 254. in alle nedes, for the tounes werre, he was, and ay the firste in armes dight; and certeynly, but-if that bokes erre, 1775 save ector, most y-drad of any wight; and this encrees of hardinesse and might cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne, that altered his spirit so with-inne. 255. in tyme of trewe , on haukinge wolde he ryde, 1780 or elles hunten boor, bere, or lyoun; the smale bestes leet he gon bi-syde. and whan that he com rydinge in-to toun, ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun, as fresh as faucon comen out of muwe, 1785 ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe. 256. and most of love and vertu was his speche, and in despyt hadde alle wrecchednesse; and doutelees, no nede was him biseche to honouren hem that hadde worthinesse, 1790 and esen hem that weren in distresse. and glad was he if any wight wel ferde, that lover was, whan he it wiste or herde. 257. for sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight but-if he were in loves heigh servyse, 1795 i mene folk that oughte it been of right. and over al this, so wel coude he devyse of sentement, and in so unkouth wyse al his array, that every lover thoughte, that al was wel, what-so he seyde or wroughte. 1800 258. and though that he be come of blood royal, him liste of pryde at no wight for to chase; {301} benigne he was to ech in general, for which he gat him thank in every place. thus wolde love, y-heried be his grace, 1805 that pryde, envye, ire, and avaryce he gan to flee, and every other vyce. 259. thou lady bright, the doughter to dione, thy blinde and winged sone eek, daun cupyde; ye sustren nyne eek, that by elicone 1810 in hil parnaso listen for to abyde, that ye thus fer han deyned me to gyde, i can no more, but sin that ye wol wende, ye heried been for ay, with-outen ende! 260. thourgh yow have i seyd fully in my song 1815 theffect and ioye of troilus servyse, al be that ther was som disese among, as to myn auctor listeth to devyse . my thridde book now ende ich in this wyse; and troilus in luste and in quiete 1820 is with criseyde, his owne herte swete. explicit liber tercius.

sin she is queynt, that wont was yow to lighte, in veyn fro-this-forth have i eyen tweye 315 y-formed, sin your vertue is a-weye. 46. o my criseyde, o lady sovereyne of thilke woful soule that thus cryeth, who shal now yeven comfort to the peyne?

who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe, 385 fortune our ioye wolde han over-throwe? 56. for in this world ther is no creature, as to my doom, that ever saw ruyne straungere than this, thorugh cas or aventure. but who may al eschewe or al devyne? 390 swich is this world; for-thy i thus defyne, ne trust no wight to finden in fortune ay propretee ; hir yeftes been comune. 57. but tel me this, why thou art now so mad to sorwen thus? why lystow in this wyse, 395 {315} sin thy desyr al holly hastow had, so that, by right, it oughte y-now suffyse? but i, that never felte in my servyse a frendly chere or loking of an yë, lat me thus wepe and wayle, til i dye. 400 58. and over al this, as thou wel wost thy-selve, this town is ful of ladies al aboute; and, to my doom, fairer than swiche twelve as ever she was, shal i finde, in som route, ye, oon or two, with-outen any doute. 405 for-thy be glad, myn owene dere brother, if she be lost, we shul recovere another. 59 . what, god for-bede alwey that ech plesaunce in o thing were, and in non other wight! if oon can singe, another can wel daunce; 410 if this be goodly, she is glad and light; and this is fayr, and that can good a-right. ech for his vertu holden is for dere, bothe heroner and faucon for rivere . 60. and eek, as writ zanzis , that was ful wys, 415 "the newe love out chaceth ofte the olde;" and up-on newe cas lyth newe avys. thenk eek, thy-self to saven artow holde; swich fyr, by proces, shal of kinde colde. for sin it is but casuel plesaunce, 420 som cas shal putte it out of remembraunce. 61. for al-so seur as day cometh after night, the newe love, labour or other wo, or elles selde seinge of a wight, don olde affecciouns alle over-go. 425 and, for thy part, thou shalt have oon of tho to abrigge with thy bittre peynes smerte; absence of hir shal dryve hir out of herte.' {316} 62. thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle, to helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deyde. 430 for doutelees, to doon his wo to falle, he roughte not what unthrift that he seyde. but troilus, that neigh for sorwe deyde, tok litel hede of al that ever he mente; oon ere it herde, at the other out it wente:— 435 63. but at the laste answerde and seyde, 'freend, this lechecraft, or heled thus to be, were wel sitting, if that i were a feend, to traysen hir that trewe is unto me! i pray god, lat this consayl never y-thee; 440 but do me rather sterve anon-right here er i thus do as thou me woldest lere. 64. she that i serve, y-wis, what so thou seye, to whom myn herte enhabit is by right, shal han me holly hires til that i deye. 445 for, pandarus, sin i have trouthe hir hight, i wol not been untrewe for no wight; but as hir man i wol ay live and sterve, and never other creature serve. 65. and ther thou seyst, thou shall as faire finde 450 as she, lat be, make no comparisoun to creature y-formed here by kinde. o leve pandare, in conclusioun, i wol not be of thyn opinioun, touching al this; for whiche i thee biseche, 455 so hold thy pees; thou sleest me with thy speche. 66. thow biddest me i sholde love an-other al freshly newe, and lat criseyde go! {317} it lyth not in my power, leve brother. and though i mighte, i wolde not do so. 460 but canstow pleyen raket , to and fro, netle in, dokke out , now this, now that, pandare? now foule falle hir , for thy wo that care! 67. thow farest eek by me, thou pandarus, as he, that whan a wight is wo bi-goon, 465 he cometh to him a pas, and seyth right thus, "thenk not on smert, and thou shalt fele noon." thou most me first transmuwen in a stoon, and reve me my passiounes alle, er thou so lightly do my wo to falle. 470 68. the deeth may wel out of my brest departe the lyf, so longe may this sorwe myne; but fro my soule shal criseydes darte out never-mo; but doun with proserpyne, whan i am deed, i wol go wone in pyne; 475 and ther i wol eternally compleyne my wo, and how that twinned be we tweyne. 69. thow hast here maad an argument, for fyn, how that it sholde lasse peyne be criseyde to for-goon, for she was myn, 480 and live in ese and in felicitee. why gabbestow , that seydest thus to me that "him is wors that is fro wele y-throwe, than he hadde erst non of that wele y-knowe?" 70. but tel me now, sin that thee thinketh so light 485 to chaungen so in love, ay to and fro, why hastow not don bisily thy might to chaungen hir that doth thee al thy wo? why niltow lete hir fro thyn herte go? {318} why niltow love an-other lady swete, 490 that may thyn herte setten in quiete? 71. if thou hast had in love ay yet mischaunce, and canst it not out of thyn herte dryve, i, that livede in lust and in plesaunce with hir as muche as creature on-lyve, 495 how sholde i that foryete, and that so blyve? o where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe, that canst so wel and formely arguwe? 72. nay, nay, god wot, nought worth is al thy reed, for which, for what that ever may bifalle, 500 with-outen wordes mo, i wol be deed. o deeth, that endere art of sorwes alle, com now, sin i so ofte after thee calle, for sely is that deeth , soth for to seyne, that, ofte y-cleped, cometh and endeth peyne. 505 73. wel wot i, whyl my lyf was in quiete, er thou me slowe , i wolde have yeven hyre; but now thy cominge is to me so swete, that in this world i no-thing so desyre. o deeth, sin with this sorwe i am a-fyre, 510 thou outher do me anoon in teres drenche, or with thy colde strook myn hete quenche! 74. sin that thou sleest so fele in sondry wyse ayens hir wil, unpreyed, day and night, do me, at my requeste, this servyse, 515 delivere now the world, so dostow right, of me, that am the wofulleste wight that ever was; for tyme is that i sterve, sin in this world of right nought may i serve.' 75. this troilus in teres gan distille, 520 as licour out of alambyk ful faste; {319} and pandarus gan holde his tunge stille, and to the ground his eyen doun he caste. but nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste, 'what, parde, rather than my felawe deye, 525 yet shal i som-what more un-to him seye:' 76. and seyde, 'freend, sin thou hast swich distresse, and sin thee list myn arguments to blame, why nilt thy-selven helpen doon redresse, and with thy manhod letten al this grame?

'lo, nece, i trowe ye han herd al how the king, with othere lordes, for the beste, hath mad eschaunge of antenor and yow, that cause is of this sorwe and this unreste. 880 but how this cas doth troilus moleste, that may non erthely mannes tonge seye; for verray wo his wit is al aweye. 127. for which we han so sorwed, he and i, that in-to litel bothe it hadde us slawe; 885 but thurgh my conseil this day, fynally, he somwhat is fro weping now with-drawe. and semeth me that he desyreth fawe with yow to been al night, for to devyse remede in this, if ther were any wyse. 890 128. this, short and pleyne, theffect of my message, as ferforth as my wit can comprehende. {331} for ye, that been of torment in swich rage, may to no long prologe as now entende; and her-upon ye may answere him sende. 895 and, for the love of god, my nece dere, so leef this wo er troilus be here.' 129. 'gret is my wo,' quod she, and sighte sore, as she that feleth dedly sharp distresse; 'but yet to me his sorwe is muchel more, 900 that love him bet than he him-self, i gesse. allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse? can he for me so pitously compleyne? y-wis, this sorwe doubleth al my peyne. 130. grevous to me, god wot, is for to twinne,' 905 quod she, 'but yet it hardere is to me to seen that sorwe which that he is inne; for wel wot i, it wol my bane be; and deye i wol in certayn,' tho quod she; 'but bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth, 910 dryve out that goost, which in myn herte beteth.' 131. thise wordes seyd, she on hir armes two fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously. quod pandarus, 'allas! why do ye so, syn wel ye wot the tyme is faste by, 915 that he shal come? arys up hastely, that he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde, but ye wol han him wood out of his minde! 132. for wiste he that ye ferde in this manere, he wolde him-selve slee; and if i wende 920 to han this fare, he sholde not come here for al the good that pryam may despende. for to what fyn he wolde anoon pretende, {332} that knowe i wel; and for-thy yet i seye, so leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye. 925 133. and shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge, and nought encresse, leve nece swete; beth rather to him cause of flat than egge , and with som wysdom ye his sorwes bete. what helpeth it to wepen ful a strete, 930 or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte? bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte. 134. i mene thus; whan i him hider bringe, sin ye ben wyse, and bothe of oon assent, so shapeth how distourbe your goinge, 935 or come ayen, sone after ye be went. wommen ben wyse in short avysement; and lat sen how your wit shal now avayle; and what that i may helpe, it shal not fayle.' 135. 'go,' quod criseyde, 'and uncle, trewely, 940 i shal don al my might, me to restreyne from weping in his sight, and bisily, him for to glade, i shal don al my peyne, and in myn herte seken every veyne; if to this soor ther may be founden salve, 945 it shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.' 136 . goth pandarus, and troilus he soughte, til in a temple he fond him allone, as he that of his lyf no lenger roughte; but to the pitouse goddes everichone 950 ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone, to doon him sone out of this world to pace; for wel he thoughte ther was non other grace. {333} 137. and shortly, al the sothe for to seye, he was so fallen in despeyr that day, 955 that outrely he shoop him for to deye. for right thus was his argument alwey: he seyde, he nas but loren, waylawey! 'for al that comth, comth by necessitee; thus to be lorn, it is my destinee. 960 138 . for certaynly, this wot i wel,' he seyde, that for-sight of divyne purveyaunce hath seyn alwey me to for-gon criseyde, sin god seeth every thing, out of doutaunce, and hem desponeth, thourgh his ordenaunce, 965 in hir merytes sothly for to be, as they shul comen by predestinee. 139. but nathelees, allas! whom shal i leve? for ther ben grete clerkes many oon, that destinee thorugh argumentes preve; 970 and som men seyn that nedely ther is noon; but that free chois is yeven us everichoon. o, welaway! so sleye arn clerkes olde, that i not whos opinion i may holde. 140 . for som men seyn, if god seth al biforn, 975 ne god may not deceyved ben, pardee, than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn, that purveyaunce hath seyn bifore to be. wherfor i seye, that from eterne if he hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede, 980 we have no free chois, as these clerkes rede. 141. for other thought nor other dede also might never be, but swich as purveyaunce, which may not ben deceyved never-mo, hath feled biforn, with-outen ignoraunce. 985 {334} for if ther mighte been a variaunce to wrythen out fro goddes purveyinge, ther nere no prescience of thing cominge; 142. but it were rather an opinioun uncerteyn, and no stedfast forseinge; 990 and certes, that were an abusioun, that god shuld han no parfit cleer witinge more than we men that han doutous weninge. but swich an errour up-on god to gesse were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse. 995 143. eek this is an opinioun of somme that han hir top ful heighe and smothe y-shore ; they seyn right thus , that thing is not to come for that the prescience hath seyn bifore that it shal come; but they seyn, that therfore 1000 that it shal come, therfore the purveyaunce wot it biforn with-outen ignoraunce; 144. and in this manere this necessitee retorneth in his part contrarie agayn. for needfully bihoveth it not to be 1005 that thilke thinges fallen in certayn that ben purveyed; but nedely, as they seyn, bihoveth it that thinges, whiche that falle, that they in certayn ben purveyed alle. 145. i mene as though i laboured me in this, 1010 to enqueren which thing cause of which thing be; as whether that the prescience of god is the certayn cause of the necessitee of thinges that to comen been, pardee; or if necessitee of thing cominge 1015 be cause certeyn of the purveyinge. 146. but now ne enforce i me nat in shewinge how the ordre of causes stant; but wel wot i, {335} that it bihoveth that the bifallinge of thinges wist biforen certeynly 1020 be necessarie, al seme it not ther-by that prescience put falling necessaire to thing to come, al falle it foule or faire. 147 . for if ther sit a man yond on a see, than by necessitee bihoveth it 1025 that, certes, thyn opinioun soth be, that wenest or coniectest that he sit; and ferther-over now ayenward yit, lo, right so it is of the part contrarie, as thus; (now herkne, for i wol not tarie): 1030 148. i seye, that if the opinioun of thee be sooth, for that he sit, than seye i this, that he mot sitten by necessitee; and thus necessitee in either is. for in him nede of sitting is, y-wis, 1035 and in thee nede of sooth; and thus, forsothe, ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe. 149. but thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore, that thyn opinion of sitting soth is; but rather, for the man sit ther bifore, 1040 therfore is thyn opinion sooth, y-wis. and i seye, though the cause of sooth of this comth of his sitting, yet necessitee is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee. 150. thus on this same wyse, out of doutaunce, 1045 i may wel maken, as it semeth me, my resoninge of goddes purveyaunce, and of the thinges that to comen be; by whiche reson men may wel y-see, {336} that thilke thinges that in erthe falle, 1050 that by necessitee they comen alle. 151. for al-though that, for thing shal come, y-wis, therfore is it purveyed, certaynly, nat that it comth for it purveyed is: yet nathelees, bihoveth it nedfully, 1055 that thing to come be purveyed, trewely; or elles, thinges that purveyed be, that they bityden by necessitee. 152. and this suffyseth right y-now, certeyn, for to destroye our free chois every del.— 1060 but now is this abusion to seyn, that fallinge of the thinges temporel is cause of goddes prescience eternel. now trewely, that is a fals sentence, that thing to come sholde cause his prescience. 1065 153. what mighte i wene, and i hadde swich a thought, but that god purveyth thing that is to come for that it is to come, and elles nought? so mighte i wene that thinges alle and some, that whylom been bifalle and over-come, 1070 ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveyaunce, that for-wot al with-outen ignoraunce. 154. and over al this, yet seye i more herto, that right as whan i woot ther is a thing, y-wis, that thing mot nedefully be so; 1075 eek right so, whan i woot a thing coming, so mot it come; and thus the bifalling of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde, they mowe not been eschewed on no syde.' 155. than seyde he thus, 'almighty iove in trone, 1080 that wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse, {337} rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone, or bring criseyde and me fro this distresse.' and whyl he was in al this hevinesse, disputinge with him-self in this matere, 1085 com pandare in, and seyde as ye may here. 156. 'o mighty god,' quod pandarus, 'in trone, ey! who seigh ever a wys man faren so? why, troilus, what thenkestow to done? hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo? 1090 what, parde, yet is not criseyde a-go! why lust thee so thy-self for-doon for drede, that in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede? 157. hastow not lived many a yeer biforn with-outen hir, and ferd ful wel at ese? 1095 artow for hir and for non other born? hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese? lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese. that, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces, right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces. 1100 158. and yet this is a wonder most of alle, why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit, touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle, ne if she can hir-self distorben it. thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit. 1105 a man may al by tyme his nekke bede whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede. 159. for-thy take hede of that that i shal seye; i have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be, so as accorded was bitwixe us tweye. 1110 and ever-mo me thinketh thus, that she hath som-what in hir hertes prevetee, {338} wher-with she can, if i shal right arede, distorbe al this, of which thou art in drede. 160. for which my counseil is, whan it is night, 1115 thou to hir go, and make of this an ende; and blisful iuno, thourgh hir grete mighte, shal, as i hope, hir grace un-to us sende. myn herte seyth, "certeyn, she shal not wende;" and for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste; 1120 and hold this purpos, for it is the beste.' 161. this troilus answerde, and sighte sore, 'thou seyst right wel, and i wil do right so;' and what him liste, he seyde un-to it more. and whan that it was tyme for to go, 1125 ful prevely him-self, with-outen mo, un-to hir com, as he was wont to done; and how they wroughte, i shal yow telle sone. 162. soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete, so gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste, 1130 that neither of hem other mighte grete, but hem in armes toke and after kiste. the lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe, as i seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge. 1135 163. tho woful teres that they leten falle as bittre weren, out of teres kinde , for peyne, as is ligne aloës or galle. so bittre teres weep nought, as i finde, the woful myrra through the bark and rinde. 1140 that in this world ther nis so hard an herte, that nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte. 164. but whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne retorned been ther-as hem oughte dwelle, {339} and that som-what to wayken gan the peyne 1145 by lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle of hire teres, and the herte unswelle, with broken voys, al hoors for-shright , criseyde to troilus thise ilke wordes seyde: 165. 'o iove, i deye, and mercy i beseche! 1150 help, troilus!' and ther-with-al hir face upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche; hir woful spirit from his propre place, right with the word, alwey up poynt to pace . and thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene, 1155 that whylom fresh and fairest was to sene. 166. this troilus, that on hir gan biholde, clepinge hir name, (and she lay as for deed, with-oute answere, and felte hir limes colde, hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed), 1160 this sorwful man can now noon other reed, but ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste; wher him was wo , god and him-self it wiste! 167. he rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde; for signe of lyf, for ought he can or may, 1165 can he noon finde in no-thing on criseyde, for which his song ful ofte is 'weylaway!' but whan he saugh that specheles she lay, with sorwful voys, and herte of blisse al bare, he seyde how she was fro this world y-fare! 1170 168. so after that he longe hadde hir compleyned, his hondes wrong, and seyde that was to seye, and with his teres salte hir brest bireyned, he gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye, and pitously gan for the soule preye, 1175 {340} and seyde, 'o lord, that set art in thy trone, rewe eek on me, for i shal folwe hir sone!' 169. she cold was and with-outen sentement, for aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon; and this was him a preignant argument 1180 that she was forth out of this world agoon; and whan he seigh ther was non other woon , he gan hir limes dresse in swich manere as men don hem that shul be leyd on bere. 170. and after this, with sterne and cruel herte, 1185 his swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte , him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte, so that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte, ther-as the doom of mynos wolde it dighte; sin love and cruel fortune it ne wolde, 1190 that in this world he lenger liven sholde. 171. thanne seyde he thus, fulfild of heigh desdayn, 'o cruel iove, and thou, fortune adverse, this al and som, that falsly have ye slayn criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse, 1195 fy on your might and werkes so diverse! thus cowardly ye shul me never winne; ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne. 172. for i this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus, wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye; 1200 shal never lover seyn that troilus dar not, for fere, with his lady dye; for certeyn, i wol bere hir companye. but sin ye wol not suffre us liven here, yet suffreth that our soules ben y-fere. 1205 {341} 173. and thou, citee, whiche that i leve in wo, and thou, pryam, and bretheren al y-fere, and thou, my moder, farewel! for i go; and attropos , make redy thou my bere! and thou, criseyde, o swete herte dere, 1210 receyve now my spirit!' wolde he seye, with swerd at herte, al redy for to deye. 174. but as god wolde, of swough ther-with she abreyde, and gan to syke, and 'troilus' she cryde; and he answerde, 'lady myn criseyde, 1215 live ye yet?' and leet his swerd doun glyde. 'ye, herte myn, that thanked be cupyde!' quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte; and he bigan to glade hir as he mighte; 175. took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte, 1220 and hir to glade he dide al his entente; for which hir goost, that flikered ay on-lofte, in-to hir woful herte ayein it wente. but at the laste, as that hir eyen glente a-syde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye, 1225 as it lay bare, and gan for fere crye, 176. and asked him, why he it hadde out-drawe? and troilus anoon the cause hir tolde, and how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe. for which criseyde up-on him gan biholde, 1230 and gan him in hir armes faste folde, and seyde, 'o mercy, god, lo, which a dede! allas! how neigh we were bothe dede! 177. thanne if i ne hadde spoken, as grace was, ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?' quod she. 1235 {342} 'ye, douteless;' and she answerde, 'allas! for, by that ilke lord that made me, i nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be, after your deeth, to han be crowned quene of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene. 1240 178. but with this selve swerd, which that here is, my-selve i wolde have slayn !'—quod she tho; 'but ho , for we han right y-now of this, and late us ryse and streight to bedde go; and therë lat vs speken of our wo. 1245 for, by the morter which that i see brenne, knowe i ful wel that day is not fer henne.' 179. whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde, nought was it lyk tho nightes here-biforn; for pitously ech other gan biholde, 1250 as they that hadden al hir blisse y-lorn, biwaylinge ay the day that they were born. til at the last this sorwful wight criseyde to troilus these ilke wordes seyde:— 180. 'lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,' quod she, 1255 'that if a wight alwey his wo compleyne, and seketh nought how holpen for to be, it nis but folye and encrees of peyne; and sin that here assembled be we tweyne to finde bote of wo that we ben inne, 1260 it were al tyme sone to biginne. 181. i am a womman, as ful wel ye woot, and as i am avysed sodeynly, so wol i telle yow, whyl it is hoot. me thinketh thus, that neither ye nor i 1265 oughte half this wo to make skilfully. {343} for there is art y-now for to redresse that yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse. 182. sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne, for ought i woot, for no-thing elles is 1270 but for the cause that we sholden twinne. considered al, ther nis no-more amis. but what is thanne a remede un-to this, but that we shape us sone for to mete? this al and som, my dere herte swete. 1275 183. now that i shal wel bringen it aboute to come ayein, sone after that i go, ther-of am i no maner thing in doute. for dredeles, with-inne a wouke or two, i shal ben here; and, that it may be so 1280 by alle right, and in a wordes fewe, i shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe. 184. for which i wol not make long sermoun, for tyme y-lost may not recovered be; but i wol gon to my conclusioun, 1285 and to the beste, in ought that i can see. and, for the love of god, for-yeve it me if i speke ought ayein your hertes reste; for trewely, i speke it for the beste; 185. makinge alwey a protestacioun, 1290 that now these wordes, whiche that i shal seye, nis but to shewe yow my mocioun, to finde un-to our helpe the beste weye; and taketh it non other wyse, i preye. for in effect what-so ye me comaunde, 1295 that wol i doon, for that is no demaunde . {344} 186. now herkeneth this, ye han wel understonde, my goinge graunted is by parlement so ferforth, that it may not be with-stonde for al this world, as by my iugement. 1300 and sin ther helpeth noon avysement to letten it, lat it passe out of minde; and lat us shape a bettre wey to finde. 187. the sothe is, that the twinninge of us tweyne wol us disese and cruelliche anoye. 1305 but him bihoveth som-tyme han a peyne, that serveth love, if that he wol have ioye. and sin i shal no ferthere out of troye than i may ryde ayein on half a morwe, it oughte lasse causen us to sorwe. 1310 188. so as i shal not so ben hid in muwe, that day by day, myn owene herte dere, sin wel ye woot that it is now a truwe, ye shul ful wel al myn estat y-here. and er that truwe is doon, i shal ben here, 1315 and thanne have ye bothe antenor y-wonne and me also; beth glad now, if ye conne; 189. and thenk right thus, "criseyde is now agoon, but what! she shal come hastely ayeyn;" and whanne, allas? by god, lo, right anoon, 1320 er dayes ten, this dar i saufly seyn. and thanne at erste shul we been so fayn, so as we shulle to-gederes ever dwelle, thal al this world ne mighte our blisse telle. 190. i see that ofte, ther-as we ben now, 1325 that for the beste, our conseil for to hyde, {345} ye speke not with me, nor i with yow in fourtenight; ne see yow go ne ryde. may ye not ten dayes thanne abyde, for myn honour, in swich an aventure? 1330 y-wis, ye mowen elles lite endure! 191. ye knowe eek how that al my kin is here, but-if that onliche it my fader be; and eek myn othere thinges alle y-fere, and nameliche, my dere herte, ye, 1335 whom that i nolde leven for to see for al this world, as wyd as it hath space; or elles, see ich never ioves face! 192. why trowe ye my fader in this wyse coveiteth so to see me, but for drede 1340 lest in this toun that folkes me dispyse by-cause of him, for his unhappy dede? what woot my fader what lyf that i lede? for if he wiste in troye how wel i fare, us neded for my wending nought to care. 1345 193. ye seen that every day eek, more and more, men trete of pees; and it supposed is, that men the quene eleyne shal restore, and grekes us restore that is mis. so though ther nere comfort noon but this, 1350 that men purposen pees on every syde, ye may the bettre at ese of herte abyde. 194. for if that it be pees, myn herte dere, the nature of the pees mot nedes dryve that men moste entrecomunen y-fere, 1355 and to and fro eek ryde and gon as blyve alday as thikke as been flen from an hyve; and every wight han libertee to bleve wher-as him list the bet, with-outen leve. {346} 195. and though so be that pees ther may be noon, 1360 yet hider, though ther never pees ne were, i moste come; for whider sholde i goon, or how mischaunce sholde i dwelle there among tho men of armes ever in fere? for which, as wisly god my soule rede, 1365 i can not seen wher-of ye sholden drede. 196. have here another wey, if it so be that al this thing ne may yow not suffyse. my fader, as ye knowen wel, pardee, is old, and elde is ful of coveityse. 1370 and i right now have founden al the gyse, with-oute net, wher-with i shal him hente; and herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente. 197. lo, troilus, men seyn that hard it is the wolf ful, and the wether hool to have; 1375 this is to seyn, that men ful ofte, y-wis, mot spenden part, the remenaunt for to save. for ay with gold men may the herte grave of him that set is up-on coveityse; and how i mene, i shal it yow devyse. 1380 198. the moeble which that i have in this toun un-to my fader shal i take, and seye, that right for trust and for savacioun it sent is from a freend of his or tweye, the whiche freendes ferventliche him preye 1385 to senden after more, and that in hye, whyl that this toun stant thus in iupartye. 199. and that shal been an huge quantitee, thus shal i seyn, but, lest it folk aspyde, this may be sent by no wight but by me; 1390 {347} i shal eek shewen him, if pees bityde, what frendes that ich have on every syde toward the court, to doon the wrathe pace of priamus, and doon him stonde in grace. 200. so, what for o thing and for other, swete, 1395 i shal him so enchaunten with my sawes, that right in hevene his sowle is, shal he mete! for al appollo, or his clerkes lawes, or calculinge avayleth nought three hawes; desyr of gold shal so his sowle blende, 1400 that, as me lyst, i shal wel make an ende. 201. and if he wolde ought by his sort it preve if that i lye, in certayn i shal fonde distorben him, and plukke him by the sleve, makinge his sort, and beren him on honde , 1405 he hath not wel the goddes understonde. for goddes speken in amphibologyes , and, for a sooth, they tellen twenty lyes. 202. eek drede fond first goddes, i suppose, thus shal i seyn, and that his cowarde herte 1410 made him amis the goddes text to glose, whan he for ferde out of his delphos sterte . and but i make him sone to converte, and doon my reed with-inne a day or tweye, i wol to yow oblige me to deye.' 1415 203. and treweliche, as writen wel i finde, that al this thing was seyd of good entente; and that hir herte trewe was and kinde towardes him, and spak right as she mente, and that she starf for wo neigh, whan she wente, 1420 {348} and was in purpos ever to be trewe; thus writen they that of hir werkes knewe. 204. this troilus, with herte and eres spradde , herde al this thing devysen to and fro; and verraylich him semed that he hadde 1425 the selve wit ; but yet to lete hir go his herte misforyaf him ever-mo. but fynally, he gan his herte wreste to trusten hir, and took it for the beste. 205. for which the grete furie of his penaunce 1430 was queynt with hope, and ther-with hem bitwene bigan for ioye the amorouse daunce. and as the briddes, whan the sonne is shene, delyten in hir song in leves grene, right so the wordes that they spake y-fere 1435 delyted hem, and made hir hertes clere . 206. but natheles, the wending of criseyde, for al this world, may nought out of his minde; for which ful ofte he pitously hir preyde, that of hir heste he might hir trewe finde. 1440 and seyde hir, 'certes, if ye be unkinde, and but ye come at day set in-to troye, ne shal i never have hele, honour, ne ioye. 207. for al-so sooth as sonne up-rist on morwe, and, god! so wisly thou me, woful wrecche, 1445 to reste bringe out of this cruel sorwe, i wol my-selven slee if that ye drecche. but of my deeth though litel be to recche, yet, er that ye me cause so to smerte, dwel rather here, myn owene swete herte! 1450 208. for trewely, myn owene lady dere, tho sleightes yet that i have herd yow stere {349} ful shaply been to failen alle y-fere. for thus men seyn, "that oon thenketh the bere , but al another thenketh his ledere." 1455 your sire is wys, and seyd is, out of drede, "men may the wyse at-renne, and not at-rede." 209. it is ful hard to halten unespyed bifore a crepul, for he can the craft; your fader is in sleighte as argus yëd ; 1460 for al be that his moeble is him biraft, his olde sleighte is yet so with him laft, ye shal not blende him for your womanhede, ne feyne a-right, and that is al my drede. 210. i noot if pees shal ever-mo bityde; 1465 but, pees or no, for ernest ne for game, i woot, sin calkas on the grekes syde hath ones been, and lost so foule his name, he dar no more come here ayein for shame; for which that weye, for ought i can espye, 1470 to trusten on, nis but a fantasye. 211. ye shal eek seen, your fader shal yow glose to been a wyf, and as he can wel preche, he shal som grek so preyse and wel alose, that ravisshen he shal yow with his speche, 1475 or do yow doon by force as he shal teche. and troilus, of whom ye nil han routhe, shal causeles so sterven in his trouthe! 212. and over al this, your fader shal despyse us alle, and seyn this citee nis but lorn; 1480 and that thassege never shal aryse, for-why the grekes han it alle sworn til we be slayn, and doun our walles torn. {350} and thus he shal you with his wordes fere , that ay drede i, that ye wol bleve there. 1485 213. ye shul eek seen so many a lusty knight a-mong the grekes, ful of worthinesse, and eche of hem with herte, wit, and might to plesen yow don al his besinesse, that ye shul dullen of the rudenesse 1490 of us sely troianes, but-if routhe remorde yow, or vertue of your trouthe. 214. and this to me so grevous is to thinke, that fro my brest it wol my soule rende; ne dredeles, in me ther may not sinke 1495 a good opinioun, if that ye wende; for-why your faderes sleighte wol us shende. and if ye goon, as i have told yow yore, so thenk i nam but deed, with-oute more. 215. for which, with humble, trewe, and pitous herte, 1500 a thousand tymes mercy i yow preye; so reweth on myn aspre peynes smerte, and doth somwhat, as that i shal yow seye, and lat us stele away bitwixe us tweye; and thenk that folye is, whan man may chese, 1505 for accident his substaunce ay to lese . 216. i mene this, that sin we mowe er day wel stele away, and been to-gider so, what wit were it to putten in assay, in cas ye sholden to your fader go, 1510 if that ye mighte come ayein or no? thus mene i, that it were a gret folye to putte that sikernesse in iupartye. {351} 217. and vulgarly to speken of substaunce of tresour, may we bothe with us lede 1515 y-nough to live in honour and plesaunce, til in-to tyme that we shul ben dede; and thus we may eschewen al this drede. for everich other wey ye can recorde, myn herte, y-wis, may not ther-with acorde. 1520 218. and hardily, ne dredeth no poverte, for i have kin and freendes elles-where that, though we comen in our bare sherte, us sholde neither lakke gold ne gere, but been honoured whyl we dwelten there. 1525 and go we anoon, for, as in myn entente, this is the beste, if that ye wole assente.' 219. criseyde, with a syk, right in this wyse answerde, 'y-wis, my dere herte trewe, we may wel stele away, as ye devyse, 1530 and finde swiche unthrifty weyes newe; but afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe. and help me god so at my moste nede as causeles ye suffren al this drede! 220. for thilke day that i for cherisshinge 1535 or drede of fader, or of other wight, or for estat, delyt, or for weddinge be fals to yow, my troilus, my knight, saturnes doughter, iuno , thorugh hir might, as wood as athamante do me dwelle 1540 eternaly in stix, the put of helle! 221. and this on every god celestial i swere it yow, and eek on eche goddesse, on every nymphe and deite infernal, on satiry and fauny more and lesse, 1545 {352} that halve goddes been of wildernesse; and attropos my threed of lyf to-breste if i be fals; now trowe me if thow leste! 222. and thou, simoys , that as an arwe clere thorugh troye rennest ay downward to the see, 1550 ber witnesse of this word that seyd is here, that thilke day that ich untrewe be to troilus, myn owene herte free, that thou retorne bakwarde to thy welle, and i with body and soule sinke in helle! 1555 223. but that ye speke, awey thus for to go and leten alle your freendes, god for-bede, for any womman, that ye sholden so, and namely, sin troye hath now swich nede of help; and eek of o thing taketh hede, 1560 if this were wist, my lif laye in balaunce, and your honour; god shilde us fro mischaunce! 224. and if so be that pees her-after take , as alday happeth, after anger, game, why, lord! the sorwe and wo ye wolden make, 1565 that ye ne dorste come ayein for shame! and er that ye iuparten so your name, beth nought to hasty in this hote fare; for hasty man ne wanteth never care. 225. what trowe ye the peple eek al aboute 1570 wolde of it seye? it is ful light to arede. they wolden seye, and swere it, out of doute, that love ne droof yow nought to doon this dede, but lust voluptuous and coward drede. {353} thus were al lost, y-wis, myn herte dere, 1575 your honour, which that now shyneth so clere. 226. and also thenketh on myn honestee, that floureth yet, how foule i sholde it shende, and with what filthe it spotted sholde be, if in this forme i sholde with yow wende. 1580 ne though i livede un-to the worldes ende, my name sholde i never ayeinward winne; thus were i lost, and that were routhe and sinne. 227. and for-thy slee with reson al this hete; men seyn, "the suffraunt overcometh," pardee; 1585 eek "who-so wol han leef, he leef mot lete;" thus maketh vertue of necessitee by pacience, and thenk that lord is he of fortune ay, that nought wol of hir recche; and she ne daunteth no wight but a wrecche. 1590 228. and trusteth this, that certes, herte swete, er phebus suster, lucina the shene, the leoun passe out of this ariete, i wol ben here, with-outen any wene. i mene, as helpe me iuno, hevenes quene, 1595 the tenthe day, but-if that deeth me assayle, i wol yow seen, with-outen any fayle.' 229. 'and now, so this be sooth,' quod troilus, 'i shal wel suffre un-to the tenthe day, sin that i see that nede it moot be thus. 1600 but, for the love of god, if it be may, so lat us stele prively away; for ever in oon, as for to live in reste, myn herte seyth that it wol been the beste.' 230. 'o mercy, god, what lyf is this?' quod she; 1605 'allas, ye slee me thus for verray tene! {354} i see wel now that ye mistrusten me; for by your wordes it is wel y-sene. now, for the love of cynthia the shene, mistrust me not thus causeles, for routhe; 1610 sin to be trewe i have yow plight my trouthe. 231. and thenketh wel, that som tyme it is wit to spende a tyme, a tyme for to winne ; ne, pardee, lorn am i nought fro yow yit, though that we been a day or two a-twinne. 1615 dryf out the fantasyes yow with-inne; and trusteth me, and leveth eek your sorwe, or here my trouthe, i wol not live til morwe. 232. for if ye wiste how sore it doth me smerte, ye wolde cesse of this; for god, thou wost, 1620 the pure spirit wepeth in myn herte, to see yow wepen that i love most, and that i moot gon to the grekes ost. ye, nere it that i wiste remedye to come ayein, right here i wolde dye! 1625 233. but certes, i am not so nyce a wight that i ne can imaginen a way to come ayein that day that i have hight. for who may holde thing that wol a-way? my fader nought, for al his queynte pley. 1630 and by my thrift, my wending out of troye another day shal torne us alle to ioye. 234. for-thy, with al myn herte i yow beseke, if that yow list don ought for my preyere, and for the love which that i love yow eke, 1635 that er that i departe fro yow here, that of so good a comfort and a chere i may you seen, that ye may bringe at reste myn herte, which that is at point to breste. {355} 235. and over al this, i pray yow,' quod she tho, 1640 'myn owene hertes soothfast suffisaunce, sin i am thyn al hool, with-outen mo, that whyl that i am absent, no plesaunce of othere do me fro your remembraunce. for i am ever a-gast, for-why men rede, 1645 that "love is thing ay ful of bisy drede." 236. for in this world ther liveth lady noon, if that ye were untrewe, as god defende! that so bitraysed were or wo bigoon as i, that alle trouthe in yow entende. 1650 and douteles, if that ich other wende, i nere but deed; and er ye cause finde, for goddes love, so beth me not unkinde.' 237. to this answerde troilus and seyde, 'now god, to whom ther nis no cause y-wrye, 1655 me glade, as wis i never un-to criseyde, sin thilke day i saw hir first with yë, was fals, ne never shal til that i dye. at shorte wordes, wel ye may me leve; i can no more, it shal be founde at preve.' 1660 238. 'graunt mercy, goode myn, y-wis,' quod she, 'and blisful venus lat me never sterve er i may stonde of plesaunce in degree to quyte him wel, that so wel can deserve; and whyl that god my wit wol me conserve, 1665 i shal so doon, so trewe i have yow founde, that ay honour to me-ward shal rebounde. 239 . for trusteth wel, that your estat royal ne veyn delyt, nor only worthinesse of yow in werre, or torney marcial, 1670 ne pompe, array, nobley, or eek richesse, {356} ne made me to rewe on your distresse; but moral vertue, grounded upon trouthe, that was the cause i first hadde on yow routhe! 240. eek gentil herte and manhod that ye hadde, 1675 and that ye hadde, as me thoughte, in despyt every thing that souned in-to badde, as rudenesse and poeplish appetyt; and that your reson brydled your delyt, this made, aboven every creature, 1680 that i was your, and shal, whyl i may dure. 241. and this may lengthe of yeres not for-do, ne remuable fortune deface; but iuppiter, that of his might may do the sorwful to be glad, so yeve us grace, 1685 er nightes ten, to meten in this place, so that it may your herte and myn suffyse; and fareth now wel, for tyme is that ye ryse.' 242. and after that they longe y-pleyned hadde, and ofte y-kist and streite in armes folde, 1690 the day gan ryse, and troilus him cladde, and rewfulliche his lady gan biholde, as he that felte dethes cares colde. and to hir grace he gan him recomaunde; wher him was wo, this holde i no demaunde. 1695 243. for mannes heed imaginen ne can, ne entendement considere, ne tonge telle the cruel peynes of this sorwful man, that passen every torment doun in helle. for whan he saugh that she ne mighte dwelle, 1700 which that his soule out of his herte rente, with-outen more, out of the chaumbre he wente. explicit liber quartus.

but at the yate ther she sholde oute ryde with certeyn folk, he hoved hir tabyde, so wo bigoon, al wolde he nought him pleyne, 35 that on his hors unnethe he sat for peyne. 6. for ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe, whan diomede on horse gan him dresse, and seyde un-to him-self this ilke sawe, 'allas,' quod he, 'thus foul a wrecchednesse 40 why suffre ich it, why nil ich it redresse? were it not bet at ones for to dye than ever-more in langour thus to drye? 7. why nil i make at ones riche and pore to have y-nough to done, er that she go? 45 why nil i bringe al troye upon a rore? why nil i sleen this diomede also? why nil i rather with a man or two stele hir a-way? why wol i this endure? why nil i helpen to myn owene cure?' 50 8. but why he nolde doon so fel a dede, that shal i seyn, and why him liste it spare: {359} he hadde in herte alwey a maner drede, lest that criseyde, in rumour of this fare , sholde han ben slayn; lo, this was al his care. 55 and elles, certeyn, as i seyde yore, he hadde it doon, with-outen wordes more. 9. criseyde, whan she redy was to ryde, ful sorwfully she sighte, and seyde 'allas!' but forth she moot, for ought that may bityde, 60 and forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas. ther nis non other remedie in this cas. what wonder is though that hir sore smerte, whan she forgoth hir owene swete herte? 10. this troilus, in wyse of curteisye, 65 with hauke on hond , and with an huge route of knightes, rood and dide hir companye, passinge al the valey fer with-oute. and ferther wolde han riden, out of doute, ful fayn, and wo was him to goon so sone; 70 but torne he moste, and it was eek to done. 11. and right with that was antenor y-come out of the grekes ost, and every wight was of it glad, and seyde he was wel-come. and troilus, al nere his herte light, 75 he peyned him with al his fulle might him to with-holde of wepinge at the leste, and antenor he kiste, and made feste. 12. and ther-with-al he moste his leve take, and caste his eye upon hir pitously, 80 and neer he rood, his cause for to make, to take hir by the honde al sobrely. and lord! so she gan wepen tendrely! and he ful softe and sleighly gan hir seye, 'now hold your day, and dooth me not to deye.' 85 {360} 13. with that his courser torned he a-boute with face pale, and un-to diomede no word he spak, ne noon of al his route; of which the sone of tydeus took hede, as he that coude more than the crede 90 in swich a craft, and by the reyne hir hente ; and troilus to troye homwarde he wente. 14. this diomede, that ladde hir by the brydel, whan that he saw the folk of troye aweye, thoughte, 'al my labour shal not been on ydel, 95 if that i may, for somwhat shal i seye. for at the worste it may yet shorte our weye. i have herd seyd, eek tymes twyës twelve, "he is a fool that wol for-yete him-selve ."' 15. but natheles this thoughte he wel ynough, 100 'that certaynly i am aboute nought if that i speke of love, or make it tough ;

480 yet were it fairer that we toke our leve. for goddes love, lat us now sone at eve our leve take, and homward lat us torne; for trewely, i nil not thus soiorne.' 70. pandare answerde, 'be we comen hider 485 to fecchen fyr , and rennen hoom ayeyn? god helpe me so, i can not tellen whider we mighten goon, if i shal soothly seyn, ther any wight is of us more fayn than sarpedoun; and if we hennes hye 490 thus sodeinly, i holde it vilanye, 71. sin that we seyden that we wolde bleve with him a wouke; and now, thus sodeinly, the ferthe day to take of him our leve, he wolde wondren on it, trewely! 495 lat us holde forth our purpos fermely; and sin that ye bihighten him to byde, hold forward now, and after lat us ryde.' 72. thus pandarus, with alle peyne and wo, made him to dwelle; and at the woukes ende, 500 {373} of sarpedoun they toke hir leve tho, and on hir wey they spedden hem to wende. quod troilus, 'now god me grace sende, that i may finden, at myn hom-cominge, criseyde comen!' and ther-with gan he singe. 505 73. 'ye, hasel-wode !' thoughte this pandare, and to him-self ful softely he seyde, 'god woot, refreyden may this hote fare er calkas sende troilus criseyde!' but natheles, he iaped thus, and seyde, 510 and swor, y-wis, his herte him wel bihighte, she wolde come as sone as ever she mighte. 74. whan they un-to the paleys were y-comen of troilus, they doun of hors alighte, and to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen. 515 and in-to tyme that it gan to nighte, they spaken of crisëyde the brighte. and after this, whan that hem bothe leste, they spedde hem fro the soper un-to reste. 75. on morwe, as sone as day bigan to clere, 520 this troilus gan of his sleep tabreyde, and to pandare, his owene brother dere, 'for love of god,' ful pitously he seyde, 'as go we seen the paleys of criseyde; for sin we yet may have namore feste, 525 so lat us seen hir paleys at the leste.' 76. and ther-with-al, his meyne for to blende, a cause he fond in toune for to go, and to criseydes hous they gonnen wende. but lord! this sely troilus was wo! 530 him thoughte his sorweful herte braste a-two. {374} for whan he saugh hir dores sperred alle, wel neigh for sorwe a-doun he gan to falle. 77. therwith whan he was war and gan biholde how shet was every windowe of the place, 535 as frost, him thoughte, his herte gan to colde; for which with chaunged deedlich pale face, with-outen word, he forth bigan to pace; and, as god wolde, he gan so faste ryde, that no wight of his contenaunce aspyde. 540 78. than seyde he thus, 'o paleys desolat, o hous, of houses whylom best y-hight , o paleys empty and disconsolat, o thou lanterne, of which queynt is the light, o paleys, whylom day, that now art night, 545 wel oughtestow to falle, and i to dye, sin she is went that wont was us to gye! 79. o paleys, whylom croune of houses alle, enlumined with sonne of alle blisse! o ring, fro which the ruby is out-falle, 550 o cause of wo, that cause hast been of lisse! yet, sin i may no bet, fayn wolde i kisse thy colde dores, dorste i for this route; and fare-wel shryne, of which the seynt is oute!' 80. ther-with he caste on pandarus his yë 555 with chaunged face, and pitous to biholde; and whan he mighte his tyme aright aspye, ay as he rood, to pandarus he tolde his newe sorwe, and eek his ioyes olde, so pitously and with so dede an hewe, 560 that every wight mighte on his sorwe rewe. 81. fro thennesforth he rydeth up and doun, and every thing com him to remembraunce {375} as he rood forth by places of the toun in whiche he whylom hadde al his plesaunce. 565 'lo, yond saugh i myn owene lady daunce; and in that temple, with hir eyen clere, me caughte first my righte lady dere. 82. and yonder have i herd ful lustily my dere herte laughe, and yonder pleye 570 saugh i hir ones eek ful blisfully. and yonder ones to me gan she seye, "now goode swete, love me wel, i preye." and yond so goodly gan she me biholde, that to the deeth myn herte is to hir holde. 575 83. and at that corner, in the yonder hous, herde i myn alderlevest lady dere so wommanly, with voys melodious, singen so wel, so goodly, and so clere, that in my soule yet me thinketh i here 580 the blisful soun; and, in that yonder place, my lady first me took un-to hir grace.' 84. thanne thoughte he thus, 'o blisful lord cupyde, whanne i the proces have in my memorie, how thou me hast werreyed on every syde, 585 men mighte a book make of it, lyk a storie. what nede is thee to seke on me victorie, sin i am thyn, and hoolly at thy wille? what ioye hastow thyn owene folk to spille? 85. wel hastow, lord, y-wroke on me thyn ire, 590 thou mighty god, and dredful for to greve! now mercy, lord, thou wost wel i desire thy grace most, of alle lustes leve. and live and deye i wol in thy bileve; {376} for which i naxe in guerdon but a bone, 595 that thou criseyde ayein me sende sone. 86. distreyne hir herte as faste to retorne as thou dost myn to longen hir to see; than woot i wel, that she nil not soiorne. now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be 600 un-to the blood of troye, i preye thee, as iuno was un-to the blood thebane, for which the folk of thebes caughte hir bane.' 87. and after this he to the yates wente ther-as criseyde out-rood a ful good paas, 605 and up and doun ther made he many a wente, and to him-self ful ofte he seyde 'allas! from hennes rood my blisse and my solas! as wolde blisful god now, for his ioye, i mighte hir seen ayein come in-to troye. 610 88. and to the yonder hille i gan hir gyde, allas! and there i took of hir my leve! and yond i saugh hir to hir fader ryde, for sorwe of which myn herte shal to-cleve. and hider hoom i com whan it was eve; 615 and here i dwelle out-cast from alle ioye, and shal, til i may seen hir eft in troye.' 89. and of him-self imagined he ofte to ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse than he was wont, and that men seyde softe, 620 'what may it be? who can the sothe gesse why troilus hath al this hevinesse?' and al this nas but his malencolye, that he hadde of him-self swich fantasye. 90. another tyme imaginen he wolde 625 that every wight that wente by the weye {377} had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde, 'i am right sory troilus wol deye.' and thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye. as ye have herd, swich lyf right gan he lede, 630 as he that stood bitwixen hope and drede. 91. for which him lyked in his songes shewe thencheson of his wo, as he best mighte, and make a song of wordes but a fewe, somwhat his woful herte for to lighte. 635 and whan he was from every mannes sighte, with softe voys he, of his lady dere, that was absent, gan singe as ye may here. 92. 'o sterre, of which i lost have al the light, with herte soor wel oughte i to bewayle, 640 that ever derk in torment, night by night, toward my deeth with wind in stere i sayle; for which the tenthe night if that i fayle the gyding of thy bemes brighte an houre, my ship and me caribdis wol devoure.' 645 93. this song when he thus songen hadde, sone he fil ayein in-to his sykes olde; and every night, as was his wone to done, he stood the brighte mone to beholde, and al his sorwe he to the mone tolde; 650 and seyde, 'y-wis, whan thou art horned newe, i shal be glad, if al the world be trewe! 94. i saugh thyn hornes olde eek by the morwe, whan hennes rood my righte lady dere, that cause is of my torment and my sorwe; 655 for whiche, o brighte lucina the clere, for love of god, ren faste aboute thy spere! {378} for whan thyn hornes newe ginne springe, than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!' 95. the day is more, and lenger every night, 660 than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho; and that the sonne wente his course unright by lenger wey than it was wont to go; and seyde, 'y-wis, me dredeth ever-mo, the sonnes sone, pheton , be on-lyve, 665 and that his fadres cart amis he dryve.' 96. upon the walles faste eek wolde he walke, and on the grekes ost he wolde see, and to him-self right thus he wolde talke, 'lo, yonder is myn owene lady free, 670 or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be! and thennes comth this eyr, that is so sote, that in my soule i fele it doth me bote. 97. and hardely this wind, that more and more thus stoundemele encreseth in my face, 675 is of my ladyes depe sykes sore. i preve it thus, for in non othere place of al this toun, save onliche in this space, fele i no wind that souneth so lyk peyne; it seyth, "allas! why twinned be we tweyne?"' 680 98. this longe tyme he dryveth forth right thus, til fully passed was the nynthe night; and ay bi-syde him was this pandarus, that bisily dide alle his fulle might him to comforte, and make his herte light; 685 yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe that she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe. 99. up-on that other syde eek was criseyde, with wommen fewe, among the grekes stronge; {379} for which ful ofte a day 'allas!' she seyde, 690 'that i was born! wel may myn herte longe after my deeth; for now live i to longe! allas! and i ne may it not amende; for now is wors than ever yet i wende. 100. my fader nil for no-thing do me grace 695 to goon ayein, for nought i can him queme; and if so be that i my terme passe, my troilus shal in his herte deme that i am fals, and so it may wel seme. thus shal i have unthank on every syde; 700 that i was born, so weylawey the tyde! 101. and if that i me putte in iupartye, to stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle that i be caught, i shal be holde a spye; or elles, lo, this drede i most of alle, 705 if in the hondes of som wrecche i falle, i am but lost, al be myn herte trewe; now mighty god, thou on my sorwe rewe!' 102. ful pale y-waxen was hir brighte face, hir limes lene, as she that al the day 710 stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay. and al the night wepinge, allas! she lay. and thus despeired, out of alle cure, she ladde hir lyf, this woful creature. 715 103. ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse, and in hir-self she wente ay portrayinge of troilus the grete worthinesse, and alle his goodly wordes recordinge sin first that day hir love bigan to springe. 720 {380} and thus she sette hir woful herte a-fyre thorugh remembraunce of that she gan desyre. 104. in al this world ther nis so cruel herte that hir hadde herd compleynen in hir sorwe, that nolde han wopen for hir peynes smerte, 725 so tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe. hir nedede no teres for to borwe. and this was yet the worste of al hir peyne, ther was no wight to whom she dorste hir pleyne. 105. ful rewfully she loked up-on troye, 730 biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles; 'allas!' quod she, 'the plesaunce and the ioye the whiche that now al torned in-to galle is, have i had ofte with-inne yonder walles! o troilus, what dostow now,' she seyde; 735 'lord! whether yet thou thenke up-on criseyde?

'but for to assaye,' he seyde, 'it nought ne greveth; for he that nought nassayeth, nought nacheveth .' 785 113. yet seide he to him-self upon a night, 'now am i not a fool, that woot wel how hir wo for love is of another wight, and here-up-on to goon assaye hir now? i may wel wite, it nil not been my prow. 790 for wyse folk in bokes it expresse, "men shal not wowe a wight in hevinesse." 114. but who-so mighte winnen swich a flour from him, for whom she morneth night and day, he mighte seyn, he were a conquerour.' 795 and right anoon, as he that bold was ay, thoughte in his herte, 'happe, how happe may, al sholde i deye, i wole hir herte seche; i shal no more lesen but my speche.' 115. this diomede, as bokes us declare, 800 was in his nedes prest and corageous; with sterne voys and mighty limes square, hardy, testif, strong, and chevalrous of dedes, lyk his fader tideus. and som men seyn, he was of tunge large; 805 and heir he was of calidoine and arge . 116 . criseyde mene was of hir stature, ther-to of shap, of face, and eek of chere, ther mighte been no fairer creature. and ofte tyme this was hir manere, 810 to gon y-tressed with hir heres clere {383} doun by hir coler at hir bak bihinde, which with a threde of gold she wolde binde. 117. and, save hir browes ioyneden y-fere, ther nas no lak, in ought i can espyen; 815 but for to speken of hir eyen clere, lo, trewely, they writen that hir syen, that paradys stood formed in hir yën. and with hir riche beautee ever-more strof love in hir, ay which of hem was more. 820 118. she sobre was, eek simple, and wys with-al, the beste y-norisshed eek that mighte be, and goodly of hir speche in general, charitable, estatliche, lusty, and free; ne never-mo ne lakkede hir pitee; 825 tendre-herted, slydinge of corage; but trewely, i can not telle hir age. 119. and troilus wel waxen was in highte, and complet formed by proporcioun so wel, that kinde it not amenden mighte; 830 yong, fresshe, strong, and hardy as lyoun; trewe as steel in ech condicioun; on of the beste enteched creature, that is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure. 120. and certainly in storie it is y-founde, 835 that troilus was never un-to no wight, as in his tyme, in no degree secounde in durring don that longeth to a knight. al mighte a geaunt passen him of might, his herte ay with the firste and with the beste 840 stod paregal, to durre don that him leste. {384} 121. but for to tellen forth of diomede:— it fil that after, on the tenthe day, sin that criseyde out of the citee yede, this diomede, as fresshe as braunche in may, 845 com to the tente ther-as calkas lay, and feyned him with calkas han to done; but what he mente, i shal yow telle sone. 122. criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle, welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette; 850 and he was ethe y-nough to maken dwelle. and after this, with-outen longe lette, the spyces and the wyn men forth hem fette; and forth they speke of this and that y-fere, as freendes doon, of which som shal ye here. 855 123. he gan first fallen of the werre in speche bitwixe hem and the folk of troye toun; and of thassege he gan hir eek byseche, to telle him what was hir opinioun. fro that demaunde he so descendeth doun 860 to asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte the grekes gyse, and werkes that they wroughte? 124. and why hir fader tarieth so longe to wedden hir un-to som worthy wight? criseyde, that was in hir peynes stronge 865 for love of troilus, hir owene knight, as fer-forth as she conning hadde or might, answerde him tho; but, as of his entente, it semed not she wiste what he mente. 125. but natheles, this ilke diomede 870 gan in him-self assure, and thus he seyde, 'if ich aright have taken of yow hede, me thinketh thus, o lady myn, criseyde, {385} that sin i first hond on your brydel leyde, whan ye out come of troye by the morwe, 875 ne coude i never seen yow but in sorwe. 126. can i not seyn what may the cause be but-if for love of som troyan it were, the which right sore wolde athinken me that ye, for any wight that dwelleth there, 880 sholden spille a quarter of a tere, or pitously your-selven so bigyle; for dredelees, it is nought worth the whyle. 127. the folk of troye, as who seyth , alle and some in preson been, as ye your-selven see; 885 for thennes shal not oon on-lyve come for al the gold bitwixen sonne and see. trusteth wel, and understondeth me, ther shal not oon to mercy goon on-lyve, al were he lord of worldes twyës fyve!

935 and so hope i that i shal yet, y-wis. {387} but he was slayn , allas! the more harm is, unhappily at thebes al to rathe, polymites and many a man to scathe. 135. but herte myn, sin that i am your man, 940 and been the ferste of whom i seche grace, to serven you as hertely as i can, and ever shal, whyl i to live have space, so, er that i departe out of this place, ye wol me graunte, that i may to-morwe, 945 at bettre leyser, telle yow my sorwe.' 136. what shold i telle his wordes that he seyde? he spak y-now, for o day at the meste; it preveth wel, he spak so that criseyde graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste, 950 for to speken with him at the leste, so that he nolde speke of swich matere; and thus to him she seyde, as ye may here: 137. as she that hadde hir herte on troilus so faste, that ther may it noon arace; 955 and straungely she spak, and seyde thus: 'o diomede, i love that ilke place ther i was born; and ioves, for his grace, delivere it sone of al that doth it care! god, for thy might, so leve it wel to fare! 960 138. that grekes wolde hir wraththe on troye wreke, if that they mighte, i knowe it wel, y-wis. but it shal not bifallen as ye speke; and god to-forn, and ferther over this, i wot my fader wys and redy is; 965 and that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde, so dere, i am the more un-to him holde. 139. that grekes been of heigh condicioun, i woot eek wel; but certein, men shal finde {388} as worthy folk with-inne troye toun, 970 as conning, and as parfit and as kinde, as been bitwixen orcades and inde. and that ye coude wel your lady serve, i trowe eek wel, hir thank for to deserve. 140. but as to speke of love, y-wis,' she seyde, 975 'i hadde a lord, to whom i wedded was , the whos myn herte al was, til that he deyde; and other love, as helpe me now pallas, ther in myn herte nis, ne never was. and that ye been of noble and heigh kinrede, 980 i have wel herd it tellen, out of drede. 141. and that doth me to han so gret a wonder, that ye wol scornen any womman so. eek, god wot, love and i be fer a-sonder; i am disposed bet, so mote i go, 985 un-to my deeth, to pleyne and maken wo. what i shal after doon, i can not seye; but trewely, as yet me list not pleye. 142. myn herte is now in tribulacioun, and ye in armes bisy, day by day. 990 here-after, whan ye wonnen han the toun, paraunter, thanne so it happen may, that whan i see that i never er say , than wole i werke that i never wroughte!

for now is clene a-go 1055 my name of trouthe in love, for ever-mo! for i have falsed oon, the gentileste that ever was, and oon the worthieste! 152. allas, of me, un-to the worldes ende, shal neither been y-writen nor y-songe 1060 no good word, for thise bokes wol me shende. o, rolled shal i been on many a tonge; {391} through-out the world my belle shal be ronge ; and wommen most wol hate me of alle. allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle!

'and certes, yow ne haten shal i never, 1080 and freendes love, that shal ye han of me, and my good word, al mighte i liven ever. and, trewely, i wolde sory be for to seen yow in adversitee. and giltelees, i woot wel, i yow leve; 1085 but al shal passe; and thus take i my leve.' 156. but trewely, how longe it was bitwene, that she for-sook him for this diomede, ther is non auctor telleth it, i wene. take every man now to his bokes hede; 1090 he shal no terme finden, out of drede. for though that he bigan to wowe hir sone, er he hir wan, yet was ther more to done. {392} 157. ne me ne list this sely womman chyde ferther than the story wol devyse. 1095 hir name, allas! is publisshed so wyde, that for hir gilt it oughte y-now suffyse. and if i mighte excuse hir any wyse, for she so sory was for hir untrouthe, y-wis, i wolde excuse hir yet for routhe. 1100 158. this troilus, as i biforn have told, thus dryveth forth, as wel as he hath might. but often was his herte hoot and cold, and namely, that ilke nynthe night, which on the morwe she hadde him byhight 1105 to come ayein: god wot, ful litel reste hadde he that night; no-thing to slepe him leste. 159. the laurer-crouned phebus , with his hete, gan, in his course ay upward as he wente, to warmen of the est see the wawes wete; 1110 and nisus doughter song with fresh entente, whan troilus his pandare after sente; and on the walles of the toun they pleyde, to loke if they can seen ought of criseyde. 160. til it was noon , they stoden for to see 1115 who that ther come; and every maner wight, that cam fro fer, they seyden it was she, til that they coude knowen him a-right. now was his herte dul, now was it light; and thus by-iaped stonden for to stare 1120 aboute nought, this troilus and pandare. 161. to pandarus this troilus tho seyde, 'for ought i wot, bi-for noon, sikerly, in-to this toun ne comth nought here criseyde. she hath y-now to done, hardily, 1125 {393} to winnen from hir fader, so trowe i; hir olde fader wol yet make hir dyne er that she go; god yeve his herte pyne!' 162. pandare answerde, 'it may wel be, certeyn; and for-thy lat us dyne, i thee biseche; 1130 and after noon than mayst thou come ayeyn.' and hoom they go, with-oute more speche; and comen ayein, but longe may they seche er that they finde that they after cape ; fortune hem bothe thenketh for to iape. 1135 163. quod troilus, 'i see wel now, that she is taried with hir olde fader so, that er she come, it wol neigh even be. com forth, i wol un-to the yate go. thise portours been unkonninge ever-mo; 1140 and i wol doon hem holden up the yate as nought ne were, al-though she come late.' 164. the day goth faste, and after that comth eve, and yet com nought to troilus criseyde. he loketh forth by hegge, by tree, by greve, 1145 and fer his heed over the wal he leyde. and at the laste he torned him, and seyde, 'by god, i woot hir mening now, pandare! al-most, y-wis, al newe was my care. 165. now douteles, this lady can hir good; 1150 i woot, she meneth ryden prively. i comende hir wysdom, by myn hood! she wol not maken peple nycely gaure on hir, whan she comth; but softely by nighte in-to the toun she thenketh ryde. 1155 and, dere brother, thenk not longe to abyde . {394} 166. we han nought elles for to don, y-wis. and pandarus, now woltow trowen me? have here my trouthe, i see hir! yond she is. heve up thyn eyen, man! maystow not see?' 1160 pandare answerde, 'nay, so mote i thee! al wrong, by god; what seystow, man, wher art? that i see yond nis but a fare-cart .' 167 . 'allas, thou seist right sooth,' quod troilus; 'but hardely, it is not al for nought 1165 that in myn herte i now reioyse thus. it is ayein som good i have a thought. noot i not how, but sin that i was wrought, ne felte i swich a confort, dar i seye; she comth to-night, my lyf, that dorste i leye!' 1170 168. pandare answerde, 'it may be wel, y-nough'; and held with him of al that ever he seyde; but in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough, and to him-self ful sobrely he seyde: 'from hasel-wode, ther ioly robin pleyde, 1175 shal come al that that thou abydest here; ye, fare-wel al the snow of ferne yere !' 169. the wardein of the yates gan to calle the folk which that with-oute the yates were, and bad hem dryven in hir bestes alle, 1180 or al the night they moste bleven there. and fer with-in the night, with many a tere, this troilus gan hoomward for to ryde; for wel he seeth it helpeth nought tabyde. 170. but natheles, he gladded him in this; 1185 he thoughte he misacounted hadde his day, {395} and seyde, 'i understonde have al a-mis. for thilke night i last criseyde say, she seyde, "i shal ben here, if that i may, er that the mone, o dere herte swete! 1190 the lyon passe , out of this ariete." 171. for which she may yet holde al hir biheste.' and on the morwe un-to the yate he wente, and up and down, by west and eek by este, up-on the walles made he many a wente. 1195 but al for nought; his hope alwey him blente; for which at night, in sorwe and sykes sore he wente him hoom, with-outen any more. 172. this hope al clene out of his herte fledde, he nath wher-on now lenger for to honge; 1200 but for the peyne him thoughte his herte bledde, so were his throwes sharpe and wonder stronge. for when he saugh that she abood so longe, he niste what he iuggen of it mighte, sin she hath broken that she him bihighte. 1205 173. the thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day after tho dayes ten, of which i tolde, bitwixen hope and drede his herte lay, yet som-what trustinge on hir hestes olde. but whan he saugh she nolde hir terme holde, 1210 he can now seen non other remedye, but for to shape him sone for to dye. 174. ther-with the wikked spirit, god us blesse, which that men clepeth wode ialousye, gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse; 1215 for which, by-cause he wolde sone dye, he ne eet ne dronk, for his malencolye, {396} and eek from every companye he fledde; this was the lyf that al the tyme he ledde. 175. he so defet was, that no maner man 1220 unnethe mighte him knowe ther he wente; so was he lene, and ther-to pale and wan, and feble, that he walketh by potente ; and with his ire he thus him-selven shente. and who-so axed him wher-of him smerte, 1225 he seyde, his harm was al aboute his herte. 176. pryam ful ofte, and eek his moder dere, his bretheren and his sustren gonne him freyne why he so sorwful was in al his chere, and what thing was the cause of al his peyne? 1230 but al for nought; he nolde his cause pleyne, but seyde, he felte a grevous maladye a-boute his herte, and fayn he wolde dye. 177. so on a day he leyde him doun to slepe, and so bifel that in his sleep him thoughte, 1235 that in a forest faste he welk to wepe for love of hir that him these peynes wroughte; and up and doun as he the forest soughte, he mette he saugh a boor with tuskes grete, that sleep ayein the brighte sonnes hete. 1240 178. and by this boor, faste in his armes folde, lay kissing ay his lady bright criseyde: for sorwe of which, whan he it gan biholde, and for despyt, out of his slepe he breyde, and loude he cryde on pandarus, and seyde, 1245 'o pandarus, now knowe i crop and rote! i nam but deed, ther nis non other bote! 179. my lady bright criseyde hath me bitrayed, in whom i trusted most of any wight, she elles-where hath now hir herte apayed; 1250 {397} the blisful goddes, through hir grete might, han in my dreem y-shewed it ful right. thus in my dreem criseyde i have biholde'— and al this thing to pandarus he tolde. 180.

'lacerae'; rather rent, or tattered. the sense 'rending' occurs in ovid, met. viii. 880. 6 . that is to seyn. the words in italics are not in the original, but were added by chaucer as explanatory. throughout the treatise, i print all such passages in italics. 8 . werdes , 'weirds,' fate. 'gloria felicis olim uiridisque iuuentae solantur maesti nunc mea fata senis.' 12 . slake , better slakke ; cf. cant. ta. e. 1849. empted , 'effeto.' ms. c. has emty . 13 . in yeres ... swete : 'dulcibus annis.' 14 . y-cleped , invoked; 'uocata,' sc. 'mors.' cf. troilus, iv. 503. 16 . naiteth , refuseth; 'negat.' icel. neita , to say nay. 17 . lighte , i.e. transitory; 'leuibus ... bonis.' the gloss 'sc. temporels' (in a) gives the right sense. sc. = scilicet, namely; the form temporels is the french plural. 18, 19 . but now : 'nunc quia fallacem mutauit nubila uultum, protrahit ingratas impia uita moras.' the translation unagreable dwellinges is an unhappy one. 22 . in stedefast degree , in a secure position; 'stabili ... gradu.' with regard to the last sentence, mr. stewart remarks, in his essay on boethius, that chaucer here 'actually reproduces the original latin metre,' i.e. a hexameter and pentameter. the true m. e. pronunciation must, for this purpose, be entirely neglected; which amounts to saying that chaucer must have been profoundly unconscious of any such intention. prose 1. 2 . and markede : 'querimoniamque lacrimabilem stili officio designarem.' hence markede is 'wrote down'; and pointel refers to the stilus . cf. som. tale, d 1742. with office , by the use (of). {420} 6 . empted , exhausted; 'inexhausti uigoris.' of course the woman here described is philosophia . 9 . doutous ; 'statura discretionis ambiguae.' 12 . heef , heaved; a. s. hōf . in layamon, hof , haf , heaf . i put heef for hef , because the e is long. 13 . so that : 'respicientiumque hominum frustrabatur intuitum.' 14 . delye (so in both mss.) = deli-ē , o. f. deliè (see cotgrave), delicate, thin, slender, from lat. delicatus , with the usual loss of c between two vowels and before the accented syllable; lat. 'tenuissimis filis.' after crafte it would have been better to insert and ; lat. 'indissolubili que materiâ.' but some mss., including c., omit que . 18 . as it is wont : 'ueluti fumosas imagines solet.' 21 . a grekissh p ; i.e. π . a grekissh t ; i.e. θ , not τ ; the greek θ being pronounced as t in latin. the reference is to φιλοσοφία πρακτικὴ καὶ θεωρητική ; in latin, philosophia actiua et contemplatiua; i. e. practical (or active) and theoretical (or contemplative) philosophy. this is the same distinction as that between the vita actiua and vita contemplatiua , so common in medieval literature; see note (3) to the sec. non. tale, g 87; and note to p. plowman, b. vi. 251. 26 . corven , cut, cut away pieces from; lat. 'sciderant.' 33 . cruel , i. e. stern; 'toruis.' 34 . thise comune : 'has scenicas meretriculas.' 39 . no-thing fructefyinge ; 'infructuosis.' hence we may perhaps prefer to read no-thing fructuous , as in caxton and thynne. 41 . holden : 'hominumque mentes assuefaciunt morbo, non liberant.' 45 . for-why , because (very common); seldom interrogative. 47 . me , from me; and, in fact, caxton and thynne read from me or fro me . the forms eleaticis , &c. are due to the lat. text—'eleaticis atque academicis studiis.' he should rather have said—'scoles of elea and of the academie.' the eleatici philosophi were the followers of zeno of elea (zeno eleates, born about b. c. 488 at elea (velia) in italy), and the favourite disciple of parmenides (who is expressly mentioned in book iii. pr. 12, l. 143). the academic philosophers were followers of plato. 49 . mermaidenes ; lat. 'sirenes,' sirens; cf. n. p. tale, b 4461, and note. til it be at the laste ; a false translation. rather unto destruction ; 'usque in exitium.' but, instead of exitium , ms. c. has exitum . 55 . plounged , drowned; 'mersa.' cf. dreint , met. 2, l. 1. 59 . ner , nearer; comparative, not positive; 'propius.' metre 2. 2 . mintinge , intending; 'tendit ... ire.' still in use in cambridgeshire. 8 . sterres of the cold moon : 'gelidae sidera lunae.' i suppose this means the constellations seen by moonlight, but invisible in the day. the expression sidus lunae , the moon's bright form, occurs in pliny, {421} nat. hist. ii. 9. 6; but it is difficult to see how sidera can have the same sense, as some commentators say. 9 . recourses , orbits; referring to the planets. y-flit , moved or whirled along by their different spheres; alluding to the old ptolemaic system of astronomy, which supposed that each planet was fastened to a revolving sphere, thus causing it to perform its orbit in a certain time, varying in the case of each. this man : 'comprensam [sc. stellam] in numeris uictor habebat.' 16 . highteth , adorns; 'ornet.' prob. from the sb. hight , hiht (a. s. hyht ), joy, delight. 17 . fleteth , flows (i.e. abounds); 'grauidis influat uuis.' 20 . empted : 'nunc iacet effeto lumine mentis.' 22 . fool , i.e. foolish, witless, senseless; 'stolidam.' prose 2. 6 . armures , i.e. defensive armour; 'arma.' 8 . in sikernesse : 'inuicta te firmitate tuerentur.' 14 . litargie ; better letargye , i.e. lethargy. cf. troil. i. 730. 19 . yplyted , pleated into a wrinkle; 'contracta in rugam ueste.' metre 3. 1 . discussed , driven away; 'discussâ ... nocte.' 4 . clustred ; 'glomerantur'; or 'covered with clouds,' as chaucer says. 5 . chorus , corus, or caurus, the north-west wind. 6 . ploungy , stormy, rainy; 'nimbosis ... imbribus.' 8 . borias , boreas, the north wind, from thrace. 9 . caves ; better cave , as in caxton and thynne; lat. 'antro.' beteth ; 'uerberet'; hence chaucer's gloss. 11 . y-shaken , 'uibratus'; i.e. tremulous, sparkling. prose 3. 2 . took , drew in, received light; 'hausi caelum.' 4 . beholde , the present tense; 'respicio.' 10 . norry , pupil, lit. nourished one; 'alumne.' 11 . parten the charge , share the burden. 15 . redoute my blame , fear blame. agrysen , shudder. 16 . quasi diceret non , as if she would say no; as if she expected the answer no. this remark is often inserted by chaucer. 19 . plato ; b.c. 428-347. before his time, solon, anaxagoras, and pythagoras all met with opposition. the fate of socrates is well known. 21 . the heritage : 'cuius hereditatem cum deinceps epicureum uulgus ac stoicum, ceterique pro sua quisque parte raptum ire molirentur, meque reclamantem renitentemque uelut in partem praedae detraherent, uestem, quam meis texueram manibus, disciderunt, abreptisque ab ea panniculis, totam me sibi cessisse credentes abiere.' 38 . anaxogore , anaxagoras, a greek philosopher ( b.c. 500-428); exiled from athens ( b.c. 450). 39 . zeno ; zeno of elea (see p. 420), born about b.c. 488, is said to have risked his life to defend his country. his fate is doubtful. 40 . senecciens , apparently meant for 'the followers of seneca.' {422} the original has: 'at canios, at senecas, at soranos ... scire potuisti.' canios , the canii; i. e. men like canius. the constancy and death of julius canius (or canus) is related by seneca, de tranquillitate, cap. xiv. cf. pr. iv. 131, and note, p. 424. 41 . sorans , the sorani; men like soranus. soranus is mentioned in tacitus, annal. xvi. 23. caxton and thynne read soranos , as in the latin text. 42 . unsolempne , uncelebrated; 'incelebris.' 49 . it is to dispyse , it (the host) is to be despised. 53 . ententif , busy about seizing useless baggage as spoil. sarpulers , sacks made of coarse canvas; in caxton, sarpleris ; 'sarcinulas.' cotgrave has: ' serpillere , a sarpler, or sarp-cloth, a piece of course canvas to pack up things in.' cf. mod. f. serpillière . 56 . palis , also spelt paleis (o. f. palis ), lit. a palisading, or a piece of strong paling, a rampart, used to translate lat. uallum . when spelt paleis , it must not be confused with paleis , a palace. metre 4. 3 . either fortune , good fortune or bad. 5 . hete : 'versum funditus excitantis aestum.' i suppose that aestum is rather 'surge' than 'heat' here. see met. vii. below, l. 3. 6 . vesevus , 'veseuus'; the same as vesuvius; cf. vergil, georg. ii. 224. 7 . wrytheth , writhes out, throws forth wreaths of smoke. here the old printed editions by caxton and thynne, as well as ms. ii. 1. 38, happily restore the text; lat. 'torquet.' 8 . caxton and thynne have thonder-leyte , which is perhaps better. ms. ii. 1. 38 has thonder leit . 13 . stable of his right : 'stabilis, suique iuris.' prose 4. 2 . artow lyk . the original is partly in greek. 'an ὄνος λύρας ?' some mss. have: 'esne ὄνος πρὸς λύραν ?' and ms. c. has: 'esne asinus ad liram?' in an edition of boethius by renatus vallinus, printed in 1656, i find the following note: 'ut et omnes veteres scripsere, varro in satyra quæ testamentum inscribitur apud agellium, lib. iii. cap. xvi: ii liberi, si erunt ὄνοι λύρας , exheredes sunto . suidas ex menandro, lucianus, martian. capella, lib. viii., atque alii quos refert erasmus, in eo adagio. imo et apud varronem id nominis satyra extitit.' it has clearly a proverbial reference to dullness of perception. ch. quotes it again in his troilus, i. 731, where he so explains it. 3 . why spillestow teres , why do you waste tears; 'quid lacrimis manas?' after these words occur, in the original, four greek words which chaucer does not translate, viz.: ἐξαύδα, μὴ κεῦθε νόῳ : i. e. speak out, do not hide them in your mind; quoted from homer, iliad i. 363. with lines 3 and 4 compare troilus, i. 857. 7 . by him-self , in itself; 'per se.' alluding to 'sharpnesse,' i. e. 'asperitas.' {423} 15 . enformedest , didst conform; 'formares.' 17 . ordre of hevene ; 'ad caelestis ordinis exemplar.' this refers to the words of plato just at the end of the 9th book of the republic: ἐν ὀυρανῷ ἴσως παράδειγμα ἀνάκειται. cf. also the last lines of book ii of the present treatise. 18 . confermedest (ms. a, enfourmedist ), didst confirm; 'sanxisti.' the reading conformedest evidently arose from confusion with enformedest above, in l. 15. 19 . mouth of plato ; referring to book v (473 d) of the republic: ἐὰν μὴ, ἢ ὁι φιλόσοφοι βασιλεύσωσιν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν, ἠ ὁι βασιλῆς τε νῦν λεγόμενοι κὶ δυνάσται φιλοσοφήσωσι γνησίως τε καὶ ἱκανῶς, καὶ τοῦτο ἐις ταὐτὸν ξυμπέσῃ, δύναμίς τε πολιτικὴ καὶ φιλοσοφία· τῶν δε νῦν πορευομένων χωρὶς ἐφ' ἑκάτερον ἁι πολλαὶ φύσεις ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἀποκλεισθῶσιν, ὀυκ ἔστι κακῶν παῦλα ... ταῖς πόλεσι· δοκῶ δὲ, ὀυδὲ τῳ ἀνθρωπίνῳ γένει. 24 . the same plato ; in the 6th dialogue on the republic. 25 . cause , reason; 'caussam.' wyse , i.e. ' for wise men.' 27 . felonous tormentours citizenes , citizens who are wicked and oppressive; the substantives are in apposition. 33 . knowinge with me , my witnesses; 'mihi ... conscii.' 36 . discordes ... preyeres ; 'inexorabilesque discordiae.' 37 . for this libertee , &c.; 'et quod conscientiae libertas habet.' 41 . conigaste , conigastus, or cunigastus; mentioned in cassiodorus, epist. lib. viii. ep. 28. the facts here referred to are known only from the present passage. prospre fortunes translates 'fortunas' simply; it seems to mean 'success' or 'well-being.' 43 . trigwille , triguilla; 'regiae praepositum domus.' 45 . auctoritee ; 'obiecta periculis auctoritate protexi.' 52 . cariages , taxes; 'uectigalibus.' see a similar use in the pers. tale, i 752, and note. 59 . inplitable , intricate: 'inexplicabilis.' coempcioun , an imposition so called; see chaucer's explanation below, in l. 64. in greek, συνωνή . 61 . campaigne , campania, in italy, provost ; 'praefectum praetorii.' 64-67 . see the footnote. i have here transposed this gloss, so as to make it follow , instead of preceding , the mention of coempcioun in the text. 68 . paulin , decius paulinus, consul in 498; mentioned in cassiodorus, epist. lib. i. epist. 23, lib. iii. epist. 29. 69 . houndes ; 'palatini canes.' 73 . albin , perhaps decius albinus, to whom theodoric addressed a letter preserved in cassiodorus, lib. iv. ep. 30. see l. 156 below. 75 . ciprian , cyprian. we know something of him from two letters in cassiodorus, epist. v. 40, 41. theodoric esteemed him highly. see a discussion of his career in h. f. stewart's essay on boethius, pp. 42-52. 78 . to hem-ward , i.e. for the benefit of the officers around me; 'mihi ... nihil apud aulicos, quo magis essem tutior, reseruaui.' {424} 81 . basilius . not much is known of him; see h. f. stewart, as above, p. 48. 82 . compelled , i.e. bribed to accuse me. for nede of foreine moneye : 'alienae aeris necessitate.' 84 . opilion , opilio; the opilio mentioned in cassiodorus, lib. v. epist. 41, and lib. viii. epist. 16, and brother of the cyprian mentioned above, l. 75. his father's name was opilio likewise. 89 . aperceived , made known. the king , i.e. theodoric, king of italy for 33 years, a.d. 493-526. his reign was, on the whole, good and glorious, but he committed the great crime of putting to death both boethius and his aged father-in-law symmachus, for which he afterwards expressed his deep repentance. see gibbon's roman empire. the chief record of his reign is in the collection of twelve books of public epistles composed in his name by cassiodorus. the seat of his government was ravenna, as mentioned below. 93 . lykned ; rather, added ; lat. 'posse adstrui uidetur.' 95-194 . see a translation into modern english of the whole of this passage, in h. f. stewart's essay, pp. 37-41. 101 . axestow in somme , if you ask particularly; 'summam quaeris?' 106, 107 . forsake , deny. have wold , have willed, did wish. 109 . and that i confesse . here chaucer's version seems to be quite at fault. 'at uolui, nec unquam uelle desistam. fatebimur? [ms. c. et fatebimur.] sed impediendi delatoris opera cessabit.' 113 . by me , with regard to me; 'de me.' 117 . socrates ; in plato's republic, book vi: τὴν ἀψεύδειαν ... μισεῖν, τὴν δ' ἀλήθειαν στέργειν (485 c). 120 . preisen , appraise, judge of: 'aestimandum.' 131 . canius , better canus , i.e. 'julius canus, whose philosophic death is described by seneca, de tranquillitate animi, cap. xiv.'—gibbon. he has already been mentioned above, prose iii. l. 40. 132 . germeynes sone , the son of germanicus. this gaius cæsar is better known as caligula, the emperor who succeeded tiberius. 143 . famileres , friends, i.e. disciples, viz. epicurus, in the de ira divina, cap. xiii (stewart). 154 . verone , verona; next to ravenna, the favourite residence of theodoric. 156 . his real maiestee , high treason, lit. 'his royal majesty'; lat. 'maiestatis crimen.' the king was intent upon repressing all freedom of speech. 167 . submittede , subdued: 'summitteret.' 171 . present , i.e. he would, even in such a case, have been allowed to appear in his defence, would have been called upon to confess his crime, and would have been condemned in a regular manner. 173 . fyve hundred , nearly 500 miles. boethius was imprisoned in a tower at pavia. 176 . as who seith, nay ; i.e. it is said ironically. the senate well {425} deserve that no one should ever defend them as i did, and be convicted for it. 181 . sacrilege ; glossed sorcerie : 'sacrilegio.' sorcery or magic is intended. 'at the command of the barbarians, the occult science of a philosopher was stigmatised with the names of sacrilege and magic.'—gibbon. see below, l. 196. 186 . pictagoras , pythagoras. the saying here attributed to him is given in the original in greek— ἕπου θεῷ . some mss. add the gloss, i. deo non diis seruiendum . ms. c. has: deo et non diis sacrificandum . 188 . i , i. e. for me. a remarkable grammatical use. 190 . right clene : 'penetral innocens domus.' 193 . thorugh , i. e. for. caxton and thynne read for . 195 . feith : 'de te tanti criminis fidem capiunt.' 198 . it suffiseth nat only ... but-yif , this alone is insufficient ... unless thou also, &c. of thy free wille : 'ultro.' 212 . good gessinge , high esteem: 'existimatio bona.' 215 . charge , burden, load: 'sarcinam.' 219 . by gessinge , in men's esteem: 'existimatione.' 223 . for drede : 'nostri discriminis terrore.' metre 5. 1 . whele , sphere: 'orbis.' not only were there seven spheres allotted to the planets, but there was an eighth larger sphere, called the sphere of fixed stars, and a ninth 'sphere of first motion,' or primum mobile , which revolved round the earth once in 24 hours, according to the ptolemaic astronomy. this is here alluded to. god is supposed to sit in an immoveable throne beyond it. 3 . sweigh , violent motion; the very word used in the same connexion in the man of lawes tale, b 296; see note to that passage. 4 . ful hornes , i. e. her horns filled up, as at full moon, when she meets 'with alle the bemes' of the sun, i. e. reflects them fully. 7 . derke hornes , horns faintly shining, as when the moon, a thin crescent, is near the sun and nearly all obscured. 'the bente mone with hir hornes pale;' troil. iii. 624. 9 . cometh eft ayein hir used cours , returns towards her accustomed course, i. e. appears again, as usual, as a morning-star, in due course. i think the text is incorrect; for cometh read torneth , i. e. turns. lat. text: 'solitas iterum mutet habenas.' the planet venus, towards one apparent extremity of her orbit, follows the sun, as an evening-star; and again, towards the other apparent extremity, precedes it as a morning-star. so cicero, de nat. deorum, ii. 20. 53: 'dicitur lucifer, cum antegreditur solem, cum subsequitur autem, hesperus.' 11 . restreinest , shortenest; the sun's apparent course being shorter in winter. lat. 'stringis.' 13 . swifte tydes , short times; viz. of the summer nights. 19 . arcturus , α boötis, in the sign libra; conspicuous in the nights of spring. 20 . sirius , α canis maioris, or the dog-star, in the sign of {426} cancer; seen before sun-rise in the so-called dog-days, in july and august. it was supposed that the near approach of sirius to the sun caused great heat. 21 . his lawe , i.e. ' its law'; and so again in his propre . 28 . on. caxton and thynne rightly read on . 29 . derke derknesses , obscure darkness: 'obscuris ... tenebris.' not a happy expression. 31 . covered and kembd : 'compta.' cf. kembde in squi. ta. f 560. 37 . erthes , lands; the pl. is used, to translate 'terras.' 41 . bonde , i.e. the chain of love; see bk. ii. met. 8. l. 15. prose 5. 1 . borken out , barked out; 'delatraui.' ms. a. changes borken into broken . the glossaries, &c., all seem to miss this excellent example of the strong pp. of berken . borken appears as a pt. t. pl. in the king of tars, l. 400. the a.s. pp. borcen appears in the a.s. leechdoms, ed. cockayne, i. 170, l. 17. 14 . oo ... king. the original is in greek— εἷς κοίρανος ἐστὶν, εἷς βασιλεύς : quoted from homer, iliad, ii. 204, with the change from ἔστω to ἐστίν . 18, 19 . thy citee , i.e. the city of heaven; note the context. 22 . palis , paling, rampart; 'uallo.' clearer than paleis , as in a, which might mean palace; but both spellings occur in french. 25 . face (facies), the look of this prison. 31 . in comune good , for the common good: 'in commune bonum.' 34 . thinges ... aposed , accusations; 'delatorum.' 45 . thy wode muse : 'musae saeuientis'; cf. met. 5 above, l. 22. 51 . thilke passiouns : 'ut quae in tumorem perturbationibus influentibus induruerunt.' 54 . by an esier touchinge refers to the preceding mowen ... softe : 'tactu blandiore mollescant.' metre 6. this metre refers to the necessity of doing everything in its proper season. 2 . 'when the sun is in cancer'; i.e. in the month of june. 4 . lat him gon , let him go and eat acorns. 6 . whan the feld : 'cùm saeuis aquilonibus stridens campus inhorruit.' chirkinge , hoarse, rustling; alluding to the rustling of frozen grass in a high wind. 15 . and forthy : 'sic quod praecipiti uiâ certum deserit ordinem, laetos non habet exitus.' prose 6. 10 . by fortunous fortune : 'fortuitis casibus.' not well expressed. 14 . the same ... thou , thou didst sing the same thing. see met. v. 22. 17 . owh! an exclamation of astonishment: lat. 'papae.' 18 . why that thou : 'cur in tam salubri sententiâ locatus aegrotes.' 20 . i not ... what : 'nescio, quid abesse coniecto.' 22 . with whiche governailes , by what sort of government. 28 . the strengthe , the strength of the gaping stockade discloses an {427} opening: 'uelut hiante ualli robore.' the corruption of chyning to schynyng in ms. a. makes sad nonsense of the passage. 42 . they may nat al : 'sibique totum extirpare non possint.' 55 . or elles the entree : 'uel aditum reconciliandae sospitatis inueni.' 56 . for-why, for , because, since. for-thy , therefore. 64 . the auctor ... of hele : 'sospitatis auctori.' 65 . norisshinges ; perhaps better norisshing , as in caxton and thynne; 'fomitem,' i. e. furtherance. 71 . faster , firmer, stronger: 'firmioribus.' 76 . to maken thinne and wayk : 'attenuare.' 77 . meneliche , moderate: 'mediocribus.' metre 7. 1 . yeten a-doun , pour down; 'fundere.' not geten , as in a. 2 . trouble , turbid; 'turbidus auster.' 3 . medleth the hete : 'misceat aestum.' see above, met. iv. l. 5. 5 . clere as glas ; cf. knight's tale, a 1958. withstande : 'mox resoluto sordida caeno, visibus obstat.' 7 . royleth , wanders; 'uagatur.' not 'rolls.' 11 . holden , keep to; cf. 'hold the hye wey'; truth, l. 20. weyve : 'gaudia pelle, pelle timorem; spemque fugato.' book ii. prose 1. 13 . to begyle ; copied in troil. iv. 2, 3 :— '—— y-thonked be fortune, that semeth trewest whan she wol bigyle.' 22 . myn entree : 'de nostro adyto.' but chaucer has translated 'adyto' as if it were 'aditu.' he translates aditum by entree in bk. i. pr. 6, l. 55. adyto is 'sanctuary.' 28 . com , i. e. let (it) come; imperative: 'adsit igitur rhetoricae suadela dulcedinis.' 32 . moedes , moods, strains; 'modos.' prolaciouns , utterances. 35 . compare chaucer's poem on fortune; and see the long note at the beginning of the notes to that poem. 45 . use hir maneres ; rather, make the best of her conduct: 'utere moribus.' agrysest , shudderest at, dreadest. 48 . she hath forsaken : 'reliquit enim te, quam non relicturam nemo umquam poterit esse securus.' 51 . the mss. usually agree in this clause. chaucer's gloss is due to an obscure note in ms. c., viz.

'when brought before æmilius [here, paulus], he is said to have degraded himself by the most abject supplications; but he was treated with kindness by the roman general;' smith, class. dict. see livy, xl. 57; xli. 53; xliv. 32; &c.; plutarch, life of æmilius. 51 . tragedie. cf. the definition in the monk. prol. b 3163; and note to anelida, 320. 53 . in greke. these two words are not in the original, but the following quotation is given in greek: δύο τοὺς πίθους, τὸν μὲν ἕνα κακῶν, τὸν δὲ ἕτερον καλῶν . some mss. add: 'duo dolia quidem malum alterum bonum.' from homer, iliad, xxiv. 527: δοιοὶ γάρ τε πίθοι κατακείαται ἐν διὸς οὔδει, δώρων, οἷα δίδωσι, κακῶν, ἕτερος δὲ ἐάων. cf. notes to wyf of bathes prol. d 170, and to leg. of good women, 195. 54 . in the entree : 'in iouis limine': ἐν διὸς οὔδει . 61 . realme : 'intra commune omnibus regnum locatus.' metre 2. 1 . hielde , pour: 'tantas fundat opes, nec retrahat manum pleno copia cornu.' {429} 8 . as fool-large , like one that is foolishly lavish: 'multi prodigus auri.' 11 . other gapinges : 'alios pandit hiatus.' some mss. have altos , but chaucer evidently read alios , as in ms. c. 13 . to any ... ende ; rather, 'within a prescribed boundary'; 'certo fine retentent.' prose 3. 22 . princes. these were, in particular, festus and symmachus. boethius married rusticiana, the daughter of symmachus. hence the allusion to his fadres-in-lawe (socerorum) just below, in l. 26; where the right sense is parents-in-law . see stewart's essay, p. 24. 23 . leef : 'delectusque in affinitatem principum ciuitatis, quod pretiosissimum propinquitatis genus est, priùs carus, quam proximus esse coepisti.' hence the whiche thing really refers back to affinitee , which is hardly obvious in the e. version. 40 . whan thou : 'cùm in circo duorum medius consulum circumfusae multitudinis exspectationem triumphali largitione satiasti.' 43 . gave thou wordes : 'dedisti ... uerba fortunae.' 48 . privee , a man of private station, not of noble rank: 'priuato.' the reference is to the election of his two sons as consuls in one day. 55 . art thou : 'an tu in hanc uitae scenam nunc primum subitus hospesque uenisti.' thus shadwe or tabernacle is meant to translate scenam . 60 . laste day ; quoted in chaucer's 'fortune,' l. 71; see note to the line. 61 . and also , i. e. even to such fortune as abides and does not desert the man: 'fortunae ... etiam manentis.' 62 . thar recche ; it is absolutely necessary to insert thee after thar ; i. e. and therefore, what, do you suppose, need you care? yif thou , i. e. whether thou. metre 3. 10 . the fairnesse : 'iam spinis abeat decus.' 13 . over-whelveth , turns over: 'verso concitat aequore.' whelveth is the right form, as noted by stratmann; it occurs in ms. ii. 1. 38, and in the black-letter editions. it occurs again in palladius on husbandry, i. 161: 'for harme ... may ... perchaunce the overwhelve ,' i.e. for perhaps harm may overthrow thee. and again, in the same, i. 781: ' overwhelve hit upsodowne,' i.e. turn it (the land) right over. 16 . tomblinge , fleeting, transitory; 'caducis.' 18 . nis , is; we must disregard the second negative. prose 4. 3 . ne be comen , is not come; i.e. did not come. it refers to past time. 5 . for in alle : 'nam in omni aduersitate fortunae infelicissimum genus est infortunii, fuisse felicem.' this famous sentence has been several times copied. see, e.g., troil. iii. 1625-8; dante, inferno , v. 121-3; tennyson, locksley hall , 76. 8 . but that thou , i.e. 'but the fact that thou.' abyest , sufferest: 'falsae opinionis supplicium luis.' 12 . for al be it : 'nam si te hoc inane nomen fortuitae felicitatis mouet.' {430} 20 . symacus , symmachus. there were several distinguished men of this family. q. aurelius symmachus was a statesman and author in the latter half of the fourth century. the one here referred to is q. aurelius memmius symmachus, who had been consul under odoacer in 485, and was involved in the fate of boethius, being put to death by theodoric in 525, shortly after the execution of boethius in 524. he had two daughters, rusticiana and galla, of whom the former married boethius. see procopius, de bello gothico, lib. i., and several epistles in cassiodorus, viz. lib. iv. epist. 22, 37, 66. 25 . thy wyf ; i. e. rusticiana, daughter of symmachus; for there is no proof that boethius was twice married (stewart, p. 24). she survived the capture of rome by the goths under totila, a.d. 546. 'the riches of rusticiana, the daughter of symmachus and widow of boethius, had been generously devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine. but the barbarians were exasperated by the report, that she had prompted the people to overthrow the statue of the great theodoric; and the life of that venerable matron would have been sacrificed to his memory, if totila had not respected her birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her revenge.'—gibbon, rom. empire, ch. 43. 31 . two sones ; the two spoken of just above (pr. iii. l. 35), as being both made consuls together. this was in 522. conseilours , i.e. of consular rank: 'consulares.' 40 . thyne ancres . hence the line, 'yit halt thyn ancre.' fortune, l. 38. 52 . thy delices : 'delicias tuas.' the sense here intended is 'effeminacy,' or 'unmanly weakness.' 56 . ful anguissous , very full of anxieties: 'anxia enim res,' &c. repeated in troilus, iii. 816, q.v. 68 . for alwey , &c. very obscure. chaucer seems to mean—'for always, in every man's case, there is, in something or other, that which (if he has not experienced it) he does not understand; or else he dreads that which he has already experienced.' the latin is clearer: 'inest enim singulis, quod inexpertus ignoret, expertus exhorreat.' 79 . nothing [is] wrecched . the insertion of is completes the sense: 'adeo nihil est miserum, nisi cùm putes.' observe ' nis a wrecche ' in chaucer's own gloss (l. 81); and see l. 25 of 'fortune.' 83 . by the agreabletee , by means of the equanimity: 'aequanimitate tolerantis.' not having the word 'equanimity' at command, chaucer paraphrases it by 'agreeabletee or egalitee,' i. e. accommodating or equable behaviour. cf. l. 92. 86 . the swetnesse , &c. cf. troilus, iii. 813-5; and man of lawes tale, b 421-2, and note. 89 . withholden , retained: 'retineri non possit.' that , so that. 107 . sheweth it wel , it is plain: 'manifestum est.' 110 . either he woot , &c.; copied in troilus, iii. 820-833. 115 . lest he lese that ... it , lest he lose that which. ms. a. omits 'it'; but the phrase is idiomatic. {431} 119 . this is to seyn that men , that is to say that, in such a case, men, &c. 120 . lost , loss. this form of the sb. occurs elsewhere; as in gower, i. 147 (goth to lost ); and in p. plowman, c. vii. 275; &c. see stratmann. 131 . it ne maketh , it does not make men miserable. metre 4. 7 . lause , loose; icel. lauss : 'solutae.' usually loos , as in cant. ta. a 4064, 4352. 8 . forthy if thou : 'fugiens periculosam sortem sedis amoenae, humili domum memento certus figere saxo.' chaucer's translation is hardly correct; sortem and sedis must be taken in close connection. 'avoiding the perilous condition of a fair (and exposed) situation, take care to found thy house securely on a low-lying (and sheltered) rock.' 12 . weleful : 'felix robore ualli duces serenus aeuum.' palis , stockade, rampart; as before, bk. i. pr. 3. 56, pr. 5. 22. prose 5. 10 . to hem that despenden it ; rather, by spending it; lat. 'effundendo.' so again, in l. 11, to thilke folke that mokeren it answers to the lat. gerund 'coaceruando.' 11 . mokeren it , hoard it. perhaps related to o.f. mucier ; see curmudgeon in my etym. dict. see mokereres , misers, below. 15 . stenteth to ben had , ceases to be possessed: 'desinit possideri.' 16 . large , lavish; 'largiendi usu desinit possideri.' 18 . as of that , as regards that hoard. 19 . a voys al hool , a voice not yet dispersed: 'uox ... tota.' 32 . yif it wanteth , if it lacks: 'carens animae motu atque membrorum compage.' 35 . of the laste : 'postremae aliquid pulcritudinis.' perhaps it means 'of the lowest kind of beauty.' mr. stewart, in his essay, p. 225, reads postremo , for which i find no authority. ms. c. has postreme . 36 . through the distinccioun : 'suique distinctione.' 40 . why sholde it nat , &c. in some editions, this passage is not marked as being assigned to boethius. in others, it is. 85 . ostelments , furniture, household goods: 'supellectilis.' o.f. ostillement , oustillement , furniture; cf. mod. f. outil , a word of doubtful origin. cf. l. 94. 90 . subgit ; as if for 'suppositis'; but the lat. text has 'sepositis,' i.e. separate, independent. 92 . beest , animal: 'diuinum merito rationis animal.' 97 . of the lowest , &c., 'by means of vilest things.' 101 . yif that al , &c., 'if all the good possessed is more valuable than the thing possessing it.' 105 . and certes : 'quod quidem haud immerito cadit.' 111 . it cometh : 'it arises from some defect in them.' 121 . gabbe i of this , do i lie concerning this? 125 . weneth. the texts have and weneth ; but i suppress and to {432} make sense, and to make the translation agree with the latin. 'atqui diuitiae possidentibus persaepè nocuerunt, cùm pessimus quisque, eóque alieni magis auidus, quidquid usquam auri gemmarumque est, se solum qui habeat dignissimum putat.' 128 . way-feringe ; ms. a, way-faryng . both forms, feringe and faring(e) occur; see stratmann. feringe = a. s. fērende , from the weak verb fēran , to go, travel; whilst faringe = a. s. farende , from the strong verb faran , to go. fēran (= *fōrian ) is derived, with vowel-mutation, from the stem *fōr , appearing in fōr , the pt. t. of faran . 130 . singe , &c. doubtless from juvenal, sat. x. 22; see wyf of bathes tale, d 1191, and the note. metre 5. largely imitated in chaucer's poem called 'the former age,' which see. see also the notes to the same. 5 . they ne coude , they knew not how: 'non bacchica munera norant liquido confundere melle.' 6 . piment , usually spiced wine; here, wine mixed with honey. see rom. of the rose, 6027, and the note. clarree , wine mixed with honey and spices, and then strained till it is clear; clarified wine. see rom. of the rose, 5967, 6026; former age, 16; kn. tale, a 1471. chaucer uses these two words here in conjunction, for the simple reason that he was thinking of the parallel passage in the french rom. de la rose, which is imitated from the present passage in boethius. ll. 8418-9 are :— 'et de l'iaue simple bevoient sans querre piment ne claré .' 7 . ne they coude : 'nec lucida uellera serum tyrio miscere ueneno.' hence the seriens are the seres , or chinese; and the venim of tyrie should rather be the venim of tyre , but chaucer follows the adjectival form in the original, both here and in bk. iii. met. 4, l. 2. venim is not the right word here; 'ueneno' merely means 'dye.' the reference is to the murex or purple shell-fish. see vergil, aen. iv. 262: ' tyrio que ardebat murice laena'; and georg. ii. 465: ' alba nec assyrio fucatur lana ueneno .' 13 . gest ne straungere : 'hospes.' cf. former age, 21. 17 . armures , defensive armour: 'arma.' the usual reading is arua , i. e. fields; but more than six mss. have arma , and chaucer's copy had the same; as appears from ms. c. 18 . for wherto : 'for to what purpose, or what sort of madness of enemies would first take up arms, when they saw but cruel wounds (as the result) and no rewards for the blood that was shed?' 22 . but the anguissous : 'sed saeuior ignibus aetnae feruens amor ardet habendi.' 24 . allas! &c. cf. former age, 27-32. the gobetes or the weightes of gold : 'auri ... pondera.' 26 . he dalf : 'pretiosa pericula fodit.' prose 6. 8 . the imperie of consulers , consular rank: 'consulare {433} imperium.' the reference is to the creation of decemviri; see livy, iii. 32. 20 . so requerable , in such request: 'expetibilis.' 29 . into the ... body : 'in secreta quaeque.' 32 . the whiche i clepe , by which i mean; so again below, l. 39. 35 . a thought , a mind; 'mentem firma sibi ratione cohaerentem.' 36 . a free man ; anaxarchus of abdera, b.c. 323. the tyraunt was nicocreon, king of cyprus. see valerius maximus, iii. 3. 44 . but what : 'quid autem est, quod in alium quisquam facere possit, quod sustinere ab alio ipse non possit?' 47 . busirides , busiris (gen. case, busiridis ), a king of egypt, who sacrificed all strangers on his altars. but hercules, coming to egypt, slew him and abolished the custom. see vergil, georg. iii. 5; ovid, tr. iii. 11. 39. in the monkes tale, b 3293, chaucer calls him busirus . 49 . regulus ; m. regulus, taken prisoner by the carthaginians, b.c. 255. the story of his embassy to rome is well known. 63 . may i. it is necessary to insert i (only found in the black-letter editions) to complete the sense. 'quod quidem de cunctis fortunae muneribus dignius existimari potest.' 71 . as of wil , i.e. when it can: 'ultro.' 80 . reproeved , disproved: 'redarguuntur.' metre 6. 2 . nero. cf. monkes tale, b 3653-84. 4 . his brother ; britannicus, poisoned by nero; tacitus, annal. xiii. 16; suetonius, nero, 33. 8 . domesman , judge; see monk. ta. b 3680, and note. 15 . septem triones , properly, the seven chief stars in the lesser bear; also sometimes used of the seven bright stars in the greater bear. the leading star in the lesser bear is the pole-star; and as that remains fixed in the north, the whole constellation came to signify the north. hence, in the monk. ta. b 3657, we are told that nero ruled over 'both est and west, south and septemtrioun '; see note to that line. 18 . nothus , notus, the south wind; see below. scorkleth , scorches; ms. a has scorchith . the prompt. parv. has: 'scorkelyn, ustulo , ustillo '; and 'scorklyd, ustillatus .' as mr. bradley notes, it is a variant of scorknen or scorpnen . the orig. icel. verb is skorpna , to become shrivelled, allied to skorpinn , shrivelled. this is a pp. form as if from *skerpa , pt. t. *skarp ; cf. skera , pt. t. skar , pp. skorinn . the adj. skarpr means 'sharp,' whence the weak verb skerpa , to sharpen. the sense of the primitive verb *skerpa was, doubtless, 'to cut'; and scorklen is, lit., 'to cause to be cut about,' when used as a transitive verb; hence, 'to shrivel up,' from the appearance of plants 'cut' with frost or parched with heat. 21 . allas! 'heu grauem sortem, quoties iniquus additur saeuo gladius ueneno!' more correctly, 'lordshippe to venimous crueltee.' ms. c has 'gladius, i. potestas exercendi gladium'; and 'ueneno, i. venenose crudelitati.' {434} prose 7. 3 . i have wel desired : 'materiam gerendis rebus optauimus, quo ne uirtus tacita consenesceret.' 10 . drawen to governaunce : 'allicere,' i. e. allure (simply). 18 . a prikke , a point; cf. parl. of foules, 57; troil. v. 1815; ho. fame, 907. from ptolemy, syntaxis, lib. i. cap. 6; cf. macrobius, in somnium scipionis, lib. ii. c. 9. 23 . tholomee , ptolemy; viz. in the beginning of book ii. of his megale syntaxis. see the same in pliny, nat. hist. ii. 68. 28 . wel unnethe , scarcely, hardly at all: 'uix angustissima inhabitandi hominibus area relinquetur.' 34 . and also sette : 'adde, quod hoc ipsum breuis habitaculi septum plures incolunt nationes.' 38 . defaute ... marchaundise ; lat. only: 'tum conmercii insolentia.' 41 . marcus tullius , i.e. cicero, in his somnium scipionis, which originally formed part of the sixth book of the de republica. see cap. vi. of that work, and note to parl. foules, 31. 43 . caucasus ; mentioned again in the wyf of bathes tale, d 1140. 45 . parthes , parthians. 59 . hath the wrecched : 'scriptorum inops deleuit obliuio.' 69 . ended : 'definitum.' we now say 'finite.' 73 . endeles : 'interminabilem.' we now say 'infinite.' 77 . were thought , were considered in comparison with eternity. 89 . this rather man , this former man, the former. 95 . seyde : 'iam tandem, inquit, intelligis me esse philosophum? tum ille nimium mordaciter, intellexeram, inquit, si tacuisses.' this story is alluded to in piers plowman; see my note to that poem, c. xiv. 226. 108 . despyseth it ; cf. troilus, v. 1821-7. metre 7. 1 . with overthrowing thought : 'mente praecipiti.' 3 . shewinge , evident, open to the view: 'latè patentes ... plagas.' 7 . dedly , mortal, perishable: 'mortali iugo.' 8 . ferne , distant: 'remotos.' this is important, as settling the sense of 'ferne halwes' in the prologue to the tales, l. 14. 13 . fabricius , the conqueror of pyrrhus; censor in b.c. 275. brutus , the slayer of cæsar. 14 . catoun , cato of utica ( b.c. 95-46). 17 . liggeth , lie ye; 'iacetis.' the imperative mood. 20 . cruel ; lat. 'sera,' which chaucer has taken as 'seua.' 'cum sera uobis rapiet hoc etiam dies.' thanne is : 'iam uos secunda mors manet.' prose 8. 2 . untretable , not to be treated with, intractable, inexorable: 'inexorabile.' 7 . unpleyten , unplait, explain: 'explicare.' 17 . windinge. read windy , i.e. unstable; lat. 'uentosam.' caxton's edition has wyndy , which proves the point. so also other old black-letter editions. {435} 23 . aspre : 'haec aspera, haec horribilis fortuna.' 26 . visages , faces. see notes to the poem on fortune. metre 8. 1 . it begins 'quòd mundus stabile fide concordes uariat uices; quòd pugnantia semina foedus perpetuum tenent.' the whole of this metre reappears in troilus, iii. 1744-1764. 6 . hath brought , hath led in, introduced: 'duxerit.' greedy to flowen ; the lat. text merely has auidum ; 'ut fluctus auidum mare certo fine coerceat.' the lat. fluctus answers to 'hise flodes.' 7 . ende , boundary: 'fine.' 8 . termes or boundes , borders: 'terminos.' 10 . love : 'et caelo imperitans amor.' on this passage is founded one in the knightes tale, a 2991-3. 11 . slakede , were to relax. the last lines are :— 'et quam nunc socia fide pulcris motibus incitant, certent soluere machinam. hic sancto populos quoque iunctos foedere continet: hic et coniugii sacrum castis nectit amoribus: hic fidis etiam sua dictat iura sodalibus. o felix hominum genus, si uestros animos amor, quo caelum regitur, regat!' book iii. prose 1. 3 . streighte , pp., i.e. stretched; 'adrectis ... auribus.' the form streight-e is plural. 6 . so , i.e. so much. better 'how much'; lat. quantum . 8 . unparigal , unequal; 'imparem.' 11 . nat only that , it is not only the case that. it would be clearer if that were omitted. 12 . agrisen , filled with dread;

'iocunditatis.' 50 . for which , on which account; 'quare.' 55 . epicurus. see cant. tales, prol. 336-8, where this is quoted; and see merch. ta. e 2021; troil. iii. 1691; 'epicurus ... sibi summum bonum uoluptatem esse constituit.' 57 . birefte awey. but the lat. text has precisely the opposite sense: 'quod caetera omnia iocunditatem animo uideantur adferre.' for adferre [ms. c afferre ], chaucer has given us the sense of auferre . 58 . studies , i.e. endeavours; 'studia.' corage ; 'animus.' 59 . al be it , &c.; 'et si caligante memoria.' 60 . not , knows not; 'uelut ebrius, domum quo tramite reuertatur, ignorat.' see cant. tales, a 1262. 67 . that ... it : 'qui quod sit optimum, id etiam ... putant.' 75 . forsake , deny; 'sequestrari nequit.' 77 . be anguissous , i.e. 'be neither full of anxiety.' the neither is implied in the following ne ; 'non esse anxiam tristemque.' it is clearer if we supply nat , as in the text. 83 . than is it good , then it is the summum bonum . 86 . lovinge , as if translating diligendo , which occurs in many mss.; but the better reading is 'deligendo,' i.e. selecting. metre 2. 1 . with slakke ... strenges ; 'fidibus lentis.' 2 . enclineth and flitteth ; 'flectat.' flitteth here means 'shifts.' 3 . purveyable , with provident care; 'prouida.' 6 . of the contre of pene ; 'poeni leones'; lions of north africa, supposed to be extremely ferocious. 8 . sturdy , cruel, hard; 'trucem ... magistrum.' 13 . and hir mayster : 'primusque lacer dente cruento domitor rabidas imbuit iras.' 15 . iangelinge , garrulous; 'garrula.' this passage is imitated twice in the cant. tales, f 607-617, h 163-174. 17 . pleyinge bisinesse ; 'ludens cura.' 19 . agreables ; this form of the pl. adj. is only used in the case of words of french origin. examples are not very common; cf. reverents below, bk. iii. met. 4, l. 6; and delitables , c. t. f 899. 26 . by privee path , by an unseen route; 'secreto tramite.' alluding to the apparent passage of the sun below the horizon and, as it were, underneath the world. cf. troil. iii. 1705. 27 . alle thinges : 'repetunt proprios quaeque recursus.' prose 3. 1 . beestes , animals; 'animalia.' chaucer always uses beest for 'animal.' {437} 15 . fals beautee , a false beauty; 'falsa ... beatitudinis species.' but 'species' may simply mean 'semblance.' 17 . after axe , caxton and thynne insert the , i.e. thee; 'te ipsum.' 24 . thee lakked : 'uel aberat quod abesse non uelles, uel aderat quod adesse noluisses.' this sentence much impressed chaucer. he again recurs to it in the complaint to pite, 99-104; parl. foules, 90, 91; and complaint to his lady, 47-49. this fact helps to prove the genuineness of the last-named poem. 36 . no. observe the use of no after a sentence containing nis nat . if there had been no negative in the preceding sentence, the form would have been nay . such is the usual rule. 40 , 41 . maken , cause, bring it about. bihighten , promised. 48 . foreyne ... pletinges ; 'forenses querimoniae.' but forenses means 'public.' 69 . be fulfild ... and axe any thing ; rather paraphrastic; 'aliquid poscens opibus expletur.' fulfild here means 'plentifully supplied,' not 'completely satisfied,' whereas in the very next line it means 'completely satisfied.' 71 . i holde me stille, and telle nat , i say nothing about; 'taceo.' seven e. words for one of latin. 74 . what may ... be , why is it; 'quid est quod,' &c. metre 3. 1 . after river , caxton and thynne insert or a gutter ; lat. 'gurgite.' 2 . yit sholde it never . this gives quite a false turn to the translation, and misses the sense intended. i quote the whole metre. 'quamuis fluente diues auri gurgite non expleturas cogat auarus opes, oneretque baccis colla rubri litoris; ruraque centeno scindat opima boue: nec cura mordax deserit superstitem, defunctumque leues non comitantur opes.' 3 . rede see ; lit. 'red shore.' however, the red sea is alluded to. chaucer's translation of baccis by 'stones' is not happy; for 'pearls' are meant. cf. horace, epod. viii. 14; sat. ii. 3. 241. pliny praises the pearls from the red sea; nat. hist. lib. xii. c. 18. prose 4. 9 . postum , short for apostume , i.e. imposthume. boch , botch, pustule. lat. struma . catullus is the well-known poet, and the allusion is to his lines addressed to himself (carm. 52) :— 'quid est, catulle, quid moraris emori? sella in curuli struma nonius sedet.' 14 . certes, thou , &c. rather involved. 'tu quoque num tandem tot periculis adduci potuisti, ut cum decorato gerere magistratum putares, cùm in eo mentem nequissimi scurrae delatorisque respiceres?' with is used for by : 'by so many perils' is intended. see chaucer's gloss. {438} 16 . decorat , decoratus. he seems to have been in high favour with king theodoric, who wrote him a letter which is preserved in cassiodorus, lib. v. 31. it is clear that boethius thought very ill of him. 32 . that he is despysed , i.e. because he is despised. the argument is, that a wicked man seems the more wicked when he is despised by a very great number of people; and if he be of high rank, his rank makes him more conspicuous, and therefore the more generally contemned. the mss. vary here; perhaps the scribes did not see their way clearly. see the footnote. 35 . and ... nat unpunisshed ; 'verùm non impunè.' 40 . comen by , arise from; 'per has umbratiles dignitates non posse contingere.' see chaucer's balade on gentilesse, l. 5. 42 . many maner , a mistranslation: 'si quis multiplici consulatu functus.' 46 . to don his office , to perform its function. cf. wyf of bathes tale, d 1144. 50 . that wenen , i.e. (folk or people) who suppose. 56 . provostrie , i.e. the prætorship; 'praetura.' 57 . rente , income; 'et senatorii census grauis sarcina.' 58 . the office ; this alludes to the praefectus annonae , once an honourable title. it was borne by augustus, when emperor. 64 . by the opinioun of usaunces ; 'opinione utentium.' chaucer's phrase seems to mean 'by estimation of the mode in which it is used.' he should have written 'by the opinioun of hem that usen it.' 66 . of hir wille , of their own accord (as it were); 'ultro.' 68 . what is it ; 'quid est, quòd in se expetendae pulcritudinis habeant, nedum aliis praestent?' metre 4. cf. monkes tale, b 3653-60. 2 . tirie , tyre; lit.

'alumne.' 136 . that lyen : 'quae autem beatitudinem mentiantur.' 142 . in timeo ; 'uti in timaeo platoni.' here chaucer keeps the words in timaeo without alteration, as if they formed the title of plato's work. the passage is: ἀλλ' ὦ σώκρατες, τοῦτό γε δὴ πάντες ὅσοι καὶ κατὰ βραχύ σωφροσύνης μετέχουσιν ἐπὶ πάσῃ ὁρμῇ καὶ σμικροῦ καὶ μεγάλου πράγματος θεὸν ἀεί που καλοῦσιν (27 c). metre 9. 3 . from sin that age hadde biginninge , since the world began: 'ab aeuo.' thou that dwellest : cf. kn. tale, a 3004. 5 . necesseden , compelled, as by necessity: 'pepulerunt.' 6 . floteringe matere : 'materiae fluitantis'; see below, pr. xi. 156. 8 . beringe , &c.; see leg. of good women, 2229, and note. 13 . thou bindest : 'tu numeris elementa ligas.' 14 . colde. alluding to the old doctrine of the four elements, with their qualities. thus the nature of fire was thought to be hot and dry , that of water cold and moist , that of air cold and dry , that of earth hot and moist . cf. ovid, met. i. 19 :— 'frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis, mollia cum duris, sine pondere habentia pondus. hanc deus et melior litem natura diremit ... dissociata locis concordi pace ligauit.' sometimes the four elements are represented as lying in four layers; the earth at the bottom, and above it the water, the air, and the fire, in due order. this arrangement is here alluded to. cf. kn. ta. a 2992. 18 . thou knittest , &c. 'tu triplicis mediam naturae cuncta mouentem connectens animam per consona membra resoluis. quae cum secta duos motum glomerauit in orbes, in semet reditura meat mentemque profundam circuit, et simili conuertit imagine caelum. tu caussis animas paribus uitasque minores prouehis, et leuibus sublimes curribus aptans in caelum terramque seris, quas lege benigna ad te conuersas reduci facis igne reuerti. da pater angustam menti conscendere sedem, da fontem lustrare boni, da luce reperta in te conspicuos animi defigere uisus.' 24 . cartes , vehicles; the bodies which contain the souls. 34 . berer : 'uector, dux, semita, terminus idem.' prose 10. 8 . for that veyn , in order that vain, &c. 11 . ne is , exists. we should now drop the negative after 'deny.' nis right as , is precisely as. 12 . is proeved : 'id imminutione perfecti imperfectum esse perhibetur.' {442} 14 . in every thing general : 'in quolibet genere.' 21 . descendeth : 'in haec extrema atque effeta dilabitur.' cf. kn. ta. 3003-10. 31, 2 . that nothing nis bettre , i.e. than whom nothing is better. so below (l. 70) we have—'that nothing nis more worth.' 32 . nis good , is good. the ne is due to the preceding 'douted.' 39 . for as moche : 'ne in infinitum ratio procedat.' 51 . this prince ; caxton and thynne have the fader ; lat. 'patrem.' 62 . feigne : 'fingat qui potest.' 88 . thanne ne may : 'quare neutrum poterit esse perfectum, cum alterutri alterum deest.' thus we must read may (sing.), not mowen (pl.). 98 . upon thise thinges , besides this: 'super haec.' 100 . porismes : ' πορίσματα '; corollaries, or deductions from a foregoing demonstration. 101 . as a corollarie : 'ueluti corollarium.' corollary is derived from corolla , dimin. of corona , a garland. it meant money paid for a garland of flowers; hence, a gift, present, gratuity; and finally, an additional inference from a proposition. chaucer gives the explanation mede of coroune , i.e. gift of a garland. 106 . they ben maked iust : these four words must be added to make sense; it is plain that they were lost by the inadvertence of the scribes. lat. text: 'sed uti iustitiae adeptione iusti , sapientiae sapientes fiunt, ita diuinitatem adeptos, deos fieri simili ratione necesse est.' 165 . the soverein fyn ; lat. text: 'ut summa, cardo, atque caussa.' chaucer seems to have taken summa to be the superl. adjective; and fyn , i.e. end, is meant to represent cardo . metre 10. 8 . tagus ; the well-known river flowing by toledo and lisbon, once celebrated for its golden sands; see ovid, am. i. 15. 34; met. ii. 251, &c. 10 . hermus , an auriferous river of lydia, into which flowed the still more celebrated pactolus. 'auro turbidus hermus;' verg. georg. ii. 137. rede brinke : 'rutilante ripa.' indus ; now the sind, in n. w. india. 11 . that medleth : 'candidis miscens uirides lapillos'; which chaucer explains as mingling smaragdes (emeralds) with margaretes (pearls); see footnote on p. 80. 17 . that eschueth : 'vitat obscuras animae ruinas.' prose 11. 3 . how mochel ; i.e. at what price will you appraise it: 'quanti aestimabis.' 24 . the thinges thanne : 'quae igitur, cùm discrepant, minimè bona sunt; cùm uero unum esse coeperint, bona fiunt: nonne haec ut bona sint, unitatis fieri adeptione contingit?' 55 . non other ; i.e. no other conclusion: 'minimè aliud uidetur.' 63 . travaileth him , endeavours: 'tueri salutem laborat.' 71 . thar thee nat doute , thou needst not doubt. {443} 81 . what woltow : 'quid, quod omnes, uelut in terras ore demerso trahunt alimenta radicibus, ac per medullas robur corticemque diffundunt?' ( maryes , marrows.) 91 . renovelen and puplisshen hem : 'propagentur.' 92 . that they ne ben , that they are; the superfluous ne is due to the ne preceding. 110 . but fyr : 'ignis uero omnem refugit sectionem.' 112 . wilful : 'de uoluntariis animae cognoscentis motibus.' 123 . som-tyme : 'gignendi opus ... interdum coërcet uoluntas.' 128 . and thus : 'adeò haec sui caritas.' 142 . for yif that that oon : 'hoc enim sublato, nec esse quidem cuiquam permanebit.' 156 . floteren , fluctuate, waver; 'fluitabunt'; see above, met. ix. 6. 161 . for thou hast : 'ipsam enim mediae ueritatis notam mente fixisti.' 163 . in that , in that thing which: 'in hoc ... quod.' metre 11. 2 . mis-weyes , by-paths: 'nullis ... deuiis.' rollen and trenden : 'reuoluat.' chaucer here uses the causal verb trenden , to revolve, answering to an a.s. form *trendan , causal of a lost verb *trindan . the e. trund-le is from the same strong verb (pp. *getrunden ). 'longosque in orbem cogat inflectens motus, animumque doceat quidquid extra molitur suis retrusum possidere thesauris.' 7 . cf. troilus, iv. 200. 8 . lighten , i.e. shine: 'lucebit.' 10 . glosa. this gloss is an alternative paraphrase of all that precedes, from the beginning of the metre. 32 . plato . from plato's phaedo, where socrates says: ὅτι ἡμῖν ἡ μάθησις ὀυκ ἄλλο τι ἢ ἀνάμνησις τυγχάνει οὖσα (72 e). prose 12. 18 . wendest , didst ween: 'mundum, inquit, hunc â deo regi paullo antè minimè dubitandum putabas.' surely chaucer has quite mistaken the construction. he should rather have said: 'thou wendest, quod she, a litel her-biforn that men ne sholden nat doute,' &c. 19 . nis governed , is governed; the same construction as before. so also but-yif there nere = unless there were (l. 25). 28 . yif ther ne were : 'nisi unus esset, qui quod nexuit contineret.' 30 . bringe forth , bring about, dispose, arrange: 'disponeret.' so ordenee : 'tam dispositos motus.' 38 . that thou : 'ut felicitatis compos, patriam sospes reuisas.' 55 . a keye and a stere : 'ueluti quidam clauus atque gubernaculum.' here chaucer unluckily translates clauus as if it were clauis . 63 . ne sheweth : 'non minùs ad contuendum patet'; i.e. is equally plain to be seen. 67 . by the keye : 'bonitatis clauo'; see note to l. 55. 73 . it mot nedes be so : 'ita, inquam, necesse est; nec beatum {444} regimen esse uideretur, si quidem detrectantium iugum foret, non obtemperantium salus.' the translation has here gone wrong. 87 . softely , gently, pleasurably: 'suauiter.' 91 . so at the laste : 'ut tandem aliquando stultitiam magna lacerantem sui pudeat.' another common reading is latrantem , but this was evidently not the reading in chaucer's copy; ms. c. has lacerantem . 97 . the poetes. see ovid, met. i. 151-162; vergil, georg. i. 277-283. 116 . scornest thou me : 'ludisne, inquam, me, inextricabilem labyrinthum rationibus texens, quae nunc quidem, qua egrediaris, introeas; nunc uerò qua introieris, egrediare; an mirabilem quemdam diuinae simplicitatis orbem complicas?' 117 . the hous of dedalus ; used to translate 'labyrinthum.' see vergil, aen. vi. 24-30, v. 588. no doubt boethius borrowed the word inextricabilis from aen. vi. 27. 125 . for which : 'ex quo neminem beatum fore, nisi qui pariter deus esset, quasi munusculum dabas.' here munusculum refers to corollarium , which chaucer translates by 'a mede of coroune'; see above, pr. x. 101. 132 . by the governements : 'bonitatis gubernaculis.' 135 . by proeves in cercles and hoomlich knowen : 'atque haec nullis extrinsecus sumptis, sed altero ex altero fidem trahente insitis domesticisque probationibus.' chaucer inserts in cercles and , by way of reference to arguments drawn from circles; but the chief argument of this character really occurs later, viz. in bk. iv. pr. vi. 81. 143 . parmenides , a greek philosopher who, according to plato, accompanied zeno to athens, where he became acquainted with socrates, who was then but a young man. plato, in his sophistes, quotes the line of parmenides which is here referred to: πάντοθεν ἐυκύκλου σφαίρας ἐναλίγκιον ὄγκῳ . this the mss. explain to mean: 'rerum orbem mobilem rotat, dum se immobilem ipsa conseruat.' the greek quotation is corruptly given in the mss., but is restored by consulting plato's text (244 e); hence we do not know what reading boethius adopted. it can hardly have been the one here given, which signifies that god is 'like the mass of a sphere that is well-rounded on all sides.' perhaps he took the idea of god's immobility from the next two verses :— μεσσόθεν ἰσοπαλὲς πάντη, τὸ γὰρ ὄυτε τι μεῖζον οὔτε βεβαίοτερον πέλει. i.e. 'equidistant from the centre in all directions; for there is nothing greater (than him), and nothing more immoveable.' 152 . plato. from plato's timaeus, 29 b: ὡς ἄρα τοὺς λόγους ὧνπερ ἐισὶν ἐξηγηταί, τούτων ἀυτῶν καὶ συγγενεῖς ὄντας . chaucer quotes this saying twice; see cant. tales, a 741-2, h 207-210. metre 12. 3 . orpheus. this well-known story is well told in vergil, georg. iv. 454-527; and in ovid, met. x. 1-85. trace , thrace; as in cant. ta. a 1972. {445} 4 . weeply , tearful, sorrowful: 'flebilibus.' 5 . moevable should precede riveres ; 'silvas currere, mobiles amnes stare coegerat.' chaucer took these two lines separately. 12 . hevene goddes , gods of heaven: 'superos.' 'illic blanda sonantibus chordis carmina temperans quicquid praecipuis deae matris fontibus hauserat, quod luctus dabat impotens, quod luctum geminans amor deflet taenara commouens, et dulci ueniam prece umbrarum dominos rogat.' 16 . laved out , drawn up (as from a well). the m. e. laven , to draw up water, to pour out, is from the a. s. lafian , to pour; for which see cockayne's a. s. leechdoms, ii. 124, ii. 74, iii. 48. it is further illustrated in my etym. dict., s. v. lavish , its derivative. no doubt it was frequently confused with f. laver , to wash; but it is an independent teutonic word, allied to g. laben . in e. friesic we find lafen sük or laven sük , to refresh oneself. it is curious that it appears even in so late an author as dryden, who translates lat. egerit (ovid, met. xi. 488) by laves , i.e. bales out. and see laven in mätzner. 16 . calliope. orpheus was son of oeagrus, king of thrace, and of calliope, chief of the muses; cf. ovid, ibis, 484. 17 . and he song. this does not very well translate the latin text; see note to l. 12. 21 . of relesinge : 'ueniam'; i.e. for the release (of eurydice). 22 . cerberus , the three-headed dog; cf. verg. georg. iv. 483; aen. vi. 417; ovid, met. iv. 449. 23 . furies ; the eumenides; cf. verg. georg. iv. 483; ovid, met. x. 46. 26 . ixion , who was fastened to an ever-revolving wheel; see georg. iv. 484; iii. 38; ovid, met. iv. 460. overthrowinge , turning over: 'non ixionium caput velox praecipitat rota.' 27 . tantalus , tormented by perpetual thirst; ovid, met. x. 41; iv. 457. 29 . tityus : 'vultur dum satur est modis non traxit tityi iecur.' cf. verg. aen. vi. 595-600; ovid, met. iv. 456. and see troilus, i. 786-8. 34 . but we wol : 'sed lex dona coërceat.' 37 . but what ; quoted in kn. tale, a 1164. 42 . and was deed : 'occidit.' the common story does not involve the immediate death of orpheus. 49 . loketh , beholds: 'uidet inferos.' the story of orpheus is excellently told in king alfred's translation of boethius, cap. xxxv. §6. {446} book iv. prose 1. 5 . forbrak , broke off, interrupted: 'abrupi.' 14 . so as , seeing that, since: 'cùm.' 25 . alle thinges may , is omnipotent: 'potentis omnia.' 27 . an enbasshinge ... ende : 'infiniti stuporis.' 30 . right ordenee , well ordered: 'dispositissima domo.' 32 . heried , praised. this resembles the language of st. paul; 2 tim. ii. 20. 41 . cesen , cause to cease: 'sopitis querelis.' 45 . alle thinges , all things being treated of: 'decursis omnibus.' 47 . fetheres , wings; 'pennas.' the a. s. pl. fethera sometimes means wings. 50 . sledes , sleds, i. e. sledges: 'uehiculis.' the vulgate version of 1 chron. xx. 3 has: 'et fecit super eos tribulas, et trahas , et ferrata carpenta transire.' wycliffe translates trahas by sledis (later version, sleddis ). metre 1. 2-5 . quoted in ho. fame, 973-8. 5 . fyr , fire. in the old astronomy, the region of air was supposed to be surrounded by a region of fire, which boethius here says was caused by the swift motion of the ether: 'quique agili motu calet aetheris transcendit ignis uerticem.' beyond this region were the planetary spheres, viz. those of the moon, mercury, venus, the sun, mars, jupiter, and saturn. this explains the allusion to the passage of thought (imagination) through 'the houses that bear the stars' (i. e. planets), in latin astriferas domos , and so, past the sun, to the seventh sphere of saturn. after this, thought soars to the eighth sphere, called the sphere of the fixed stars (denoted below by 'the circle of the stars' or 'the firmament'); and after 'wending on the back of it,' i. e. getting beyond it, reaches the primum mobile , where 'the lord of kings holds the sceptre of his might.' 'donec in astriferas surgat domos, phoeboque coniungat uias, aut comitetur iter gelidi senis miles corusci sideris; vel quocunque micans nox pingitur, recurrat astri circulum, atque ubi iam exhausti fuerit satis, polum relinquit extimum, dorsaque uelocis premat aetheris compos uerendi luminis.' 9 . saturnus , the planet saturn; which chaucer rightly gives as the sense of 'senis.' {447} and he y-maked , i.e. and he (thought) becomes a knight. i hesitate to insert is after he , because all the authorities omit it; in fact, the phrase and he y-maked seems to be equivalent to 'he being made.' i do not understand what is meant by 'miles corusci sideris,' unless it means that boethius imagines thought to become a companion of mars, and thus to be made a soldier, in the service of that bright planet. 15 . images of sterres , i.e. constellations, which were fancifully supposed to represent various objects. 18 . worshipful light. ms. a has dredefulle clerenesse . both are translations of 'uerendi luminis.' 22 . swifte cart : 'uolucrem currum.' cart is sometimes used for car or chariot. 25 . but now , &c. these words are supposed to be spoken by boethius, when he remembers all the truth. 'haec dices, memini, patria est mihi.' 26 . heer wol i fastne my degree : 'hic sistam gradum.' the sense is rather, 'here will i [ or , let me] fix my step,' or 'plant my foot'; i.e. remain. cf. 'siste gradum,' i. e. stop; verg. aen. vi. 465. 27 . but yif : 'quod si terrarum placeat tibi noctem relictam uisere, quos miseri toruos populi timent cernes tyrannos exules.' prose 2. 1 . owh , an exclamation; 'papae.' 13 . fey , the faith, the certainty: 'fides.' sentence , opinion. 31 . and in that : 'quod uero quisque potest.' may , can do. 38 . lad , led; studies , desires: 'quae diuersis studiis agitur.' 71 . yif that : 'etsi coniecto, inquam, quid uelis.' 84 . knit forth : 'contexe, inquam, cetera.' 93 . shewinge , evident; is open and shewinge : 'patet.' 97 . iugement. evidently meant to translate iudicium . but chaucer misread his text, which has indicium . 'idque, ut medici sperare solent, indicium est erectae iam resistentisque naturae.' 103 . ledeth hem , i. e. leads them to: 'qui ne ad hoc quidem peruenire queunt, ad quod eos naturalis ducit, ac pene compellit, intentio.' 104 . and what : 'et quid? si hoc tam magno ac pene inuicto praeeuntis naturae desererentur auxilio?' 112 . ne shrewes : 'neque enim leuia aut ludicra praemia petunt, quae consequi atque obtinere non possunt.' 120 . laye , might lie (subjunctive): 'quo nihil ulterius peruium iaceret incessui.' 137 . for to ben , even to exist. so below, ben frequently means 'to exist,' as appears from the argument. 151 . mowen , have power to act: 'possunt.' 161 . understonde , mayest understand: 'ut intelligas.' {448} 187 . plato , viz. in the gorgias and alcibiades i, where many of the arguments here used may be found. metre 2. the subject of this metre is from plato, de republica, x. chaucer's translation begins with the 7th line of the latin. 'quos uides sedere celsos solii culmine reges, purpura claros nitente, septos tristibus armis, ore toruo comminantes, rabie cordis anhelos, detrahat si quis superbis vani tegmina cultus, iam uidebit intus arctas dominos ferre catenas. hinc enim libido uersat auidis corda uenenis; hinc flagellat ira mentem fluctus turbida tollens, moeror aut captos fatigat, aut spes lubrica torquet. ergo, cum caput tot unum cernas ferre tyrannos, non facit, quod optat, ipse dominis pressus iniquis.' 12 . tyrannyes. this reading (in c ed.) gives the sense better than the reading tyrauntis (in a); although the latter is quite literal. prose 3. 7 . stadie , race-course: 'in stadio'; which chaucer explains by 'furlong.' 10 . purposed , equivalent to proposed ; 'praemium commune propositum.' 14 . for which thing : 'quare probos mores sua praemia non relinquunt.' 25 , 26 . so as , whereas. for men , because men. 27 . part-les , without his share of: 'praemii ... expertem.' 35 . no day : 'quod nullus deterat dies.' 39 . undepartable , inseparable: 'inseparabili poena.' 49 . may it semen : 'possuntne sibi supplicii expertes uideri, quos omnium malorum extrema nequitia non afficit modò, verumetiam uehementer inficit?' 70 . under , beneath, below: 'infra hominis meritum.' metre 3. 1 . aryvede , cause to arrive, drove: 'appulit.' the sailes : 'vela neritii ducis;' chaucer inserts ulixes , i. e. ulysses. the phrase is from ovid: 'dux quoque neritius,' i. e. ulysses; fasti, iv. 69. neritos was a mountain of ithaca, the island of ulysses. ms. c. reads naricii , which accounts for the form narice . 3 . circes , circe, as in ho. fame, 1272; inserted by chaucer. 7 . that oon of hem : 'hunc apri facies tegit.'—'one of them, his face is covered,' &c. 9 . marmorike : 'marmaricus leo.' this refers to the country of barca, on the n. african coast, to the w. of egypt. 13 . but al-be-it : 'sed licet uariis modis numen arcadis alitis obsitum miserans ducens peste soluerit hospitis.' arcas ales , the winged arcadian, i. e. mercury, because born on the arcadian mountain cyllene. 16 . algates , at any rate; by this , already. 19 . akornes of okes ; this is not tautology, for an acorn was, originally, any fruit of the field, as the etymology (from acre ) shews. {449} 23 . over-light , too light, too feeble: 'o leuem nimium manum, nec potentia gramina, membra quae ualeant licet, corda uertere non ualent.' 32 . for vyces : 'dira, quae penitus meant, nec nocentia corpori mentis uulnere saeuiunt.' prose 4. 2 . ne i ne see nat : 'nec iniuria dici uideo uitiosos, tametsi humani corporis speciem seruent, in belluas tamen animorum qualitate mutari.' chaucer's 'as by right' should rather be 'as by wrong.' it means 'i do not see that it is wrongly said.' 4, 5 . but i nolde , but i would rather that it were not so with regard to evil men: 'eis licere noluissem.' 18 . to mowen don , to be able to do: 'potuisse.' 22 . three , i. e. the triple misfortune of wishing to do evil, of being able to do it, and of doing it. 26 . thilke unselinesse : 'hoc infortunio'; i. e. the ability to sin. 28 . so shullen : 'carebunt, inquit, ocius, quàm uel tu forsitan uelis, uel illi sese existiment esse carituros.' 30 . for ther : 'neque enim est aliquid in tam breuibus uitae metis ita serum, quod exspectare longum immortalis praesertim animus putet.' 39 . by the outtereste : 'eorum malitiam ... mors extrema finiret.' 42 . ben perdurable , i. e. to exist eternally: 'infinitam liquet esse miseriam, quam constat esse aeternam.' 51 . ther is not why , there is no reason why. 54 . but of the thinges : 'sed ex his, quae sumpta sunt, aeque est necessarium.' 64 . but i understande : 'sed alio quodam modo infeliciores esse improbos arbitror impunitos, tametsi nulla ratio correctionis, nullus respectus habeatur exempli.' thus 'non ensaumple of lokinge' is wrong; it should rather be 'non lokinge of ensaumple,' i. e. no regard to the example thus set. 90 . which defaute : 'quam iniquitatis merito malum esse confessus es.' hence 'for the deserte of felonye' means 'when we consider what wickedness deserves.' 102 . to leten , to leave: 'nullane animarum supplicia ... relinquis?' 132 . briddes , i. e. owls. see parl. foules, 599. 142 . right as thou : 'ueluti si uicibus sordidam humum caelumque respicias, cunctis extra cessantibus, ipsa cernendi ratione nunc coeno nunc sideribus interesse uidearis.' 153 . wrong. it should rather run: 'sholde we wene that we were blinde?' lat. 'num uidentes eadem caecos putaremus?' 193 . in al , altogether: 'tota,' sc. opera defensorum. 197, 8 . at any clifte : 'aliqua rimula.' sawen , if they should perceive: 'uiderent.' 200 . right for : 'compensatione adipiscendae probitatis.' hence for to geten hem means 'of obtaining for themselves.' 205 . y-leten , left: 'nullus prorsus odio locus relinquatur.' {450} metre 4. 1 . what delyteth you , why does it delight you? 'quid tantos iuuat excitare motus?' lines 8-10 are put interrogatively in the latin text. 9 . and wilnen : 'alternisque uolunt perire telis.' 10 . but the resoun : 'non est iusta satis saeuitiae ratio.' prose 5. 9 . y-shad , shed, spread abroad: 'transfunditur.' 20 . hepeth : 'nunc stuporem meum deus rector exaggerat.' metre 5. the latin text begins thus:— 'si quis arcturi sidera nescit propinqua summo cardine labi, cur legat tardus plaustra boötes, mergatque seras aequore flammas, cum nimis celeres explicet ortus, legem stupebit aetheris alti.' 1 . sterres of arcture , the stars of the constellation arcturus. arcturus was (as here) another name for boötes, though it properly meant the brightest star in that constellation. it is at no great distance from the north pole, and so appears to revolve round it. the passage, which is somewhat obscure, seems to refer to the manner of the rising and setting of boötes; and the argument is, that a person ignorant of astronomy, must be puzzled to understand the laws that rule the motions of the sky. 3 . the sterre , the constellation. chaucer uses sterre in this sense in several passages; see kn. tale, a 2059, 2061, and the notes. 8 . the fulle mone. this alludes to an eclipse of the moon, as appears from below. 9 . infect : 'infecta metis noctis opacae.' confuse , confounded, overcome; the light of the moon disappears in a full eclipse, rendering the stars brighter. 11 . the comune errour : 'commouet gentes publicus error.' the people who do not understand an eclipse, are excited by it; they bring out basins, and beat them with a loud din, to frighten away the spirit that is preying on the moon. chaucer calls them corybantes , but these were the priests of cybele. still, they celebrated her rites to the sound of noisy music; and he may have been thinking of a passage in ovid, fasti, iv. 207-14. c. adds a gloss: 'i. vulgaris error, quo putatur luna incantari.' 12 . thikke strokes , frequent strokes. the word resembles thilke in c., because lk is not unfrequently written for kk in the fifteenth century, to the confusion of some editors; see my paper on ghost-words, in the philol. soc. trans. 1886, p. 370. 18 . by quakinge flodes : 'frementi ... fluctu.' 23 . alle thinges : 'cuncta, quae rara prouehit aetas.' 24 . troubly errour : 'nubilus error.' prose 6. 9 . laven it , to exhaust the subject: 'cui uix exhausti quidquam satis sit.' as to lave , see note to bk. iii. met. 12-16. {451} 13 . ydre , hydra; see note below to met. 7. the form is due to hydrae (ms. hydre ) in the latin text. ne ther ... ende : 'nec ullus fuerit modus.' manere is not the sense of modus here; it rather means ende or 'limit.' 14 . but-yif : 'nisi quis eas uiuacissimo mentis igne coërceat.' 24, 5 . but althogh : 'quòd si te musici carminis oblectamenta delectant, hanc oportet paullisper differas uoluptatem, dum nexas sibi ordine contexo rationes.' this is said, because this 'prose' is of unusual length. for sibi , another reading is tibi ; hence chaucer's 'weve to thee resouns.' 30 . muable , mutable, changeable: 'mutabilium naturarum.' cf. kn. tale, a 2994-3015. 33 . in the tour : 'haec in suae simplicitatis arce composita, multiplicem rebus gerendis modum statuit.' 48 . but destinee : 'fatum uero singula digerit in motum, locis, formis, ac temporibus distributa.' 59 . and ledeth : 'et quod simpliciter praesentarieque prospexit, per temporales ordines ducit.' cf. troilus, i. 1065-9. 67 . by some sowle ; glossed 'anima mundi.' this idea is from plato, de legibus, bk. x: ψυχὴν δὴ διοικοῦσαν καὶ ἐνοικοῦσαν ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς πάντῃ κινουμένοις μῶν ὀυ καὶ τὸν ὀυρανὸν ἀνάγκη διοικεῖν φάναι ; (896 d). 68 . by the celestial , &c.; alluding to the old astrology. 81 . a same centre ; i.e. concentric circles, as on a target. 87 . and yif ther be : 'si quid uero illi se medio connectat et societ, in simplicitatem cogitur, diffundique ac diffluere cessat.' 93 . laus , loose; from icel. lauss . also spelt loos , los . it axeth : 'quantò illum rerum cardinem uicinius petit.' thus it axeth is due to 'petit,' i.e. seeks, tends to. 97 . thanne right swich : 'igitur uti est ad intellectum ratiocinatio; ad id quod est, id quod gignitur; ad aeternitatem tempus; ad puncti medium circulus: ita est fati series mobilis ad prouidentiae stabilem simplicitatem.' 108 . whan they passen : 'cùm ... proficiscantur.' thus whan should rather be so as , i.e. whereas, because. 112 . unable to ben ybowed : 'indeclinabilem caussarum ordinem promat.' 114 . sholden fleten : 'res ... temerè fluituras.' for which it is : 'quo fit.' 116 . natheles : 'nihilominus tamen suus modus ad bonum dirigens cuncta disponat.' 121 . ne the ordre : 'ne dum ordo de summi boni cardine proficiscens, a suo quoquam deflectat exordio.' ms. c. has 'deflectatur.' 123 . 'quae uero, inquies, potest ulla iniquior esse confusio.' for 'iniquior,' ms. c. has the extraordinary reading 'inquiescior,' which chaucer seems to have tried to translate. 138 . ne it ne is nat : 'non enim dissimile est miraculum nescienti.' 145 . hele of corages : 'animorum salus.' {452} 148 . lecher , i.e. leech-er, healer: 'medicator mentium deus.' 151 . leneth hem , gives them: 'quod conuenire nouit, accommodat.' printed leueth in dr. furnivall's print of ms. c., but leneth in morris's edition of ms. a. there is no doubt as to the right reading, because accommodare and lenen are both used in the sense 'to lend.' 154 . for to constreine : 'ut pauca ... perstringam,' i.e. 'to touch lightly on a few things.' chaucer has taken it too literally, but his paraphrase is nearly right. 157 . right kepinge : 'aequi seruantissimum.' 159 . my familer : 'familiaris noster lucanus.' alluding to the famous line:—'victrix caussa deis placuit, sed uicta catoni'; pharsalia, i. 128. 168 . with-holden , retain: 'retinere fortunam.' 176 . by me , by my means, by my help: 'nam ut quidam me quoque excellentior ait.' this looks like a slip on the part of boethius himself, for the supposed speaker is philosophy herself. the philosopher here alluded to still remains unknown. ms. c. has 'me quidem'; and 'me' is glossed by 'philosophus per me.' 177 . in grek. some mss. have: ἀνδρὸς ἱεροῦ σῶμα δυνάμεις ὀικοδομοῦσι . there are various readings, but chaucer had before him only the interpretation: 'viri sacri corpus aedificauerunt uirtutes.' such is the reading in ms. c. 179 . taken , delivered, entrusted. 'fit autem saepe, uti bonis summa rerum gerenda deferatur.' 182 . remordeth : 'remordet,' i.e. plagues, troubles. 186 . and other folk : 'alii plus aequo metuunt, quod ferre possunt.' 201 . of wikkede merite : 'eos male meritos omnes existimant.' 206 . serven to shrewes : 'famulari saepe improbis.' i trowe : 'illud etiam dispensari credo.' 207, 8 . overthrowinge to yvel : 'praeceps.' 209 . egren him : 'eum ... exacerbare possit.' 219 . shal be cause : 'ut exercitii bonis, et malis esset caussa supplicii.' hence continuacion seems to mean 'endurance' or 'continuance.' 242 . sin that : the original is in greek, with (in ms. c.) the false gloss:—'fortissimus in mundo deus omnia regit.' the greek is— ἀργαλέον δέ με ταῦτα θεὸν ὣς πάντ' ἀγορεύειν . from homer, il. xii. 176, with the change from ἀγορεῦσαι to ἀγορεύειν . 247 . with-holden , to retain, keep, maintain; 'retinere.' 253 . ben outrageous or haboundant : 'abundare.' hence outrageous is 'superfluous' or 'excessive.' 257 . and whan : 'quo refectus, firmior in ulteriora contendas.' metre 6. 1 . 'si uis celsi iura tonantis pura sollers cernere mente, adspice summi culmina caeli'; &c. 5 . cercle : 'non sol ... gelidum phoebes impedit axem.' 6 . ne the sterre : 'nec quae summo uertice mundi flectit rapidos ursa meatus, numquam occiduo lota profundo, cetera cernens sidera mergi, cupit oceano tingere flammas.' hence deyen is to dye, to dip. {453} 10 . hesperus , the evening-star; lucifer , the morning-star. 13 . and thus : 'sic aeternos reficit cursus alternus amor; sic astrigeris bellum discors exsulat oris. haec concordia temperat aequis elementa modis, ut pugnantia vicibus cedant humida siccis'; &c. 20, 1 . in the firste somer-sesoun warminge : 'uere tepenti.' this is not the only place where uer is translated somer-sesoun , a phrase used as applicable to may in p. plowman, prol. 1. another name for 'spring' was lent or lenten . 24 . and thilke : 'eadem rapiens condit et aufert obitu mergens orta supremo.' 29 . and tho : 'et quae motu concitat ire, sistit retrahens, ac uaga firmat.' 31 . for yif : 'nam nisi rectos reuocans itus, flexos iterum cogat in orbes, quae nunc stabilis continet ordo, dissepta suo fonte fatiscant.' 37 . this is : 'hic est cunctis communis amor repetuntque boni fine teneri, quia non aliter durare queunt, nisi conuerso rursus amore refluant caussae, quae dedit esse.' prose 7. 57 . ne also it : 'ita uir sapiens molestè ferre non debet, quotiens in fortunae certamen adducitur.' 60 . matere , material, source. 62 . vertu. boethius here derives uirtus from uires : 'quod suis uiribus nitens non superetur aduersis.' 64 . ne certes : 'neque enim uos in prouectu positi uirtutis, diffluere deliciis, et emarcescere uoluptate uenistis; proelium cum omni fortuna nimis acre conseritis, ne uos aut tristis opprimat, aut iucunda corrumpat: firmis medium uiribus occupate.' 72 . in your hand : 'in uestra enim situm est manu.' metre 7. 1 . wreker , avenger; attrides , atrides, i.e. agamemnon, son of atreus. chaucer derived the spelling agamenon from a gloss in ms. c. gower (c. a. ii. 344) has the same form. 2 . recovered : 'fratris amissos thalamos piauit.' 5 . menelaus , &c.; 'that was his brother menelaus' wife.' the usual idiom; see note to squieres tale, e 209. 9 . doughter , i.e. iphigenia; ovid, met. xii. 27-38. 13 . itacus : 'fleuit amissos ithacus sodales.' the well-known story of ulysses of ithaca; from homer, od. ix. 15 . empty ; as if translating 'inani.' but the right reading is inmani (or immani ); i.e. 'vast.' ms. c. 'inmani,' glossed 'magno.' 20 . hercules. see monkes tale, b 3285, and the notes. in the first note, this passage from boethius is given at length. 21 . centaures , centaurs; hercules was present at the fight between the centauri and lapithae; ovid, met. xii. 541; ix. 191. 22 . lyoun , the nemean lion; ovid, met. ix. 197, 235; her. ix. 61. 23 . arpyes , the harpies; with reference to the destruction of the stymphalian birds, who ate human flesh; met. ix. 187. the gloss in the footnote— in the palude of lyrne (in the marsh of lerna) is a mistake; it should refer to the hydra mentioned below. {454} 25 . dragoun , the dragon in the garden of the hesperides; met. ix. 190. the 'golden metal' refers to the golden apples. 26 . cerberus ; ovid, met. ix. 185. 27 . unmeke , proud; see note to monkes tale, b 3293; and ovid, met. ix. 194-6. note that hors (= horses) is plural. 29 . ydra , hydra; ovid, met. ix. 192. 30 . achelous ; see the story in ovid, met. ix. 1-97. boethius imitates ovid, l. 97, viz. 'et lacerum cornu mediis caput abdidit undis.' 35 . antheus , antaeus; ovid, met. ix. 184. for the story, see lucan, phars. iv. 590-660; lucan refers to lybia as the place of combat; l. 582. 36 . cacus ; see the story in ovid, fasti, i. 543-86. 39 . boor , the boar of erymanthus; ovid, her. ix. 87. for scomes (lit. scums), caxton and thynne have vomes , for fomes (foams). 40 . the whiche , 'which shoulders were fated to sustain (lit. thrust against) the high sphere of heaven.' alluding to hercules, when he took the place of atlas. 45 . nake , expose your unarmed backs (lat. nudatis), like one who runs away. an unarmed man was usually said to be naked ; as in othello, v. 2. 258; 2 hen. vi. iii. 2. 234; &c. book v. prose 1. 3 . a mistranslation. 'recta quidem exhortatio, tuaque prorsus auctoritate dignissima.' 9 . assoilen to thee the. i prefer this reading, adopted from caxton's edition, because the others make no sense. the original reading was to the the (= to thee the ), as in ms. ii. 1. 38, whence, by dropping one the , the reading to the in c. and ed. ms. a. alters it to the to the , absurdly. the fact is, that to thee belongs to the next clause. 'festino, inquit, debitum promissionis absoluere, uiamque tibi ,' &c. 14 . to douten , to be feared; 'uerendumque est.' 28 . left, or dwellinge , left, or remaining ( reliquus ). 'quis enim ... locus esse ullus temeritati reliquus potest?' 31 . nothing : 'nihil ex nihilo exsistere.' referring to the old saying:—'ex nihilo nihil fit.' 34 . prince and beginnere oddly represents lat. 'principio.' casten it , laid it down: 'quasi quoddam iecerint fundamentum.' i supply it . 44 . aristotulis , aristotle. the reference is to aristotle's physics, bk. ii. ch. 5. 47 . for grace , for the sake of; 'gratia.' 50 . right as , just as if. by cause , for the purpose. 55 . ne dolve , had not digged; subj. mood. 57 . abregginge. a mistranslation. 'hae sunt igitur fortuiti caussae compendii'; these then are the causes of this fortuitous acquisition. {455} compendium also means 'an abbreviating,' which chaucer here expresses by abbregginge , introducing at the same time the word 'hap,' to make some sense. 66 . uneschuable , inevitable; 'ineuitabili.' metre 1. 2 . achemenie : 'rupis achaemeniae scopulis,' in the crags of the achæmenian rock or mountain. achaemenius signifies 'persian,' from achaemenes, the grandfather of cyrus; but is here extended to mean armenian. the sources of the tigris and euphrates are really different, though both rise in the mountains of armenia; they run for a long way at no great distance apart, and at last join. 3 . fleinge bataile , the flying troop; with reference to the well-known parthian habit, of shooting arrows at those who pursue them; see vergil, georg. iii. 31. 5 . yif they , when they; meaning that they do converge. 9 . and the wateres : 'mixtaque fortuitos implicet unda modos: quae tamen ipsa uagos terrae decliuia cursus gurgitis et lapsi defluus ordo regit.' 14 . it suffereth : 'fors patitur frenos, ipsaque lege meat.' prose 2. 4 , 5 . destinal , fatal; 'fatalis.' corages , minds. 10 . thinges ... fleen , i.e. to be avoided: 'fugienda.' 13 . is , i.e. is in, resides in: 'quibus in ipsis inest ratio.' 14 . ordeyne , determine: 'constituo.' 16 . sovereines , the supreme divine substances. this is a good example of adjectives of french origin with a plural in -es . 17 , 18 . wil : 'et incorrupta uoluntas.' might : 'potestas.' 27 . talents , affections: 'affectibus.' 30 . caitifs , captive: 'propriâ libertate captiuae.' ll. 30-34 are repeated in troilus, iv. 963-6; q.v. 34 . in greek : πάντ' ἐφορᾷ καὶ πάντ' ἐπακούει . from homer, iliad, iii. 277— ἠελιος θ', ὃς πάντ' ἐφορᾷς καὶ πάντ' ἐπακούεις . cf. odys. xii. 323. metre 2. 1, 2 . with the , &c.; 'melliflui ... oris.' cleer , bright; alluding to the common phrase in homer: λαμπρὸν φάος ἠελίοιο ; il. i. 605, &c. 8 . strok : 'uno mentis cernit in ictu.' prose 3. a large portion of this prose, down to l. 71, is paraphrased in troilus, iv. 967-1078; q.v. 12 . libertee of arbitre , freedom of will (arbitrii). 19 . proeve , approve of: 'neque ... illam probo rationem.' 30 . but ... ytravailed : 'quasi uero ... laboretur'; which means, rather, 'as if the question were.' 35 . but i ne , &c. the translation is here quite wrong; and as in another place, chaucer seems to have read nitamur as uitamus . the text has: 'at nos illud demonstrare nitamur.' the general sense is: 'but let me endeavour to shew, that, in whatever manner the order of causes be arranged, the happening of things foreseen is necessary, {456} although the foreknowledge does not seem to impose on future things a necessity of their happening.' 53 . for althogh that ; cf. troil. iv. 1051-7, which is clearer. 55 . therfore ne bityde they nat , it is not on that account that they happen. cf. 'nat that it comth for it purveyed is'; troil. iv. 1053. 71 . at the laste , finally: 'postremò.' 78 . that i ne wot it. the ne is superfluous, though in all the copies. the sense is—'if i know a thing, it cannot be false (must be true) that i know it.' 80 . wanteth lesing , is free from falsehood: 'mendacio careat.' 90, 1 . egaly , equally: 'aeque.' indifferently , impartially. 94 . iape-worthy, ridiculous: 'ridiculo.' from horace, sat. ii. 5. 59—'o laërtiade, quicquid dicam, aut erit, aut non.' 116 . sent , for sendeth , sends: 'mittit.' 117 . constreineth : 'futuri cogit certa necessitas.' 121 . discrecioun , discernment: 'indiscreta confusio.' and yit , &c. to make sense, read than whiche for of the whiche . the whole clause, from and yit down to wikke is expanded from 'quoque nihil sceleratius excogitari potest.' 131 . sin that : 'quando optanda omnia series indeflexa connectit?' 141 . that nis nat ... or that , that cannot be approached before. the latin is: 'illique inaccessae luci, prius quoque quam impetrent, ipsa supplicandi ratione coniungi.' 142 . impetren , ask for it; such is the reading of ms. ii. 1. 38. a coined word, from the lat. impetrent ; see the last note. 146 . linage of mankind , the human race; to which his (its) twice refers below. 147 . a litel her-biforn ; i.e. in bk. iv. met. 6. 34, where we find—'they sholden departen from hir welle, that is to seyn, from hir biginninge, and faylen.' see p. 122. metre 3. 1 . what , &c.: 'quaenam discors foedera rerum caussa resoluit?' 2 . the coniunccioun ; but this gloss seems to be wrong, for the reference is rather (as chaucer, following a sidenote in ms. c., says in l. 5) to foreknowledge and free will. 3 . whiche god , i.e. what divinity: 'quis tanta deus veris statuit bella duobus?' 7 . but ther nis. the lat. text is put interrogatively: 'an nulla est discordia ueris, semperque sibi certa cohaerent?' 10 . by fyr : 'oppressi luminis igne.' 12 . but wherefore : 'sed cur tanto flagrat amore veri tectas reperire notas?' it thus appears that y-covered , i.e. 'that are hidden,' refers to thilke notes , not to sooth ; cf. l. 15. but the translation is not at all happy. 16 . wot it : 'scitne, quod appetit anxia nosse?' 18 . seith thus : 'sed quis nota scire laborat? at si nescit, quid caeca petit? quis enim quidquam nescius optet?' {457} 23 . or who : 'aut quis ualeat nescita sequi? quoue inueniat, quisue repertam queat ignarus noscere formam?' 26 . but whan : not a statement, as here taken, but a question. 'an cùm mentem cerneret altam pariter summam et singula norat?' the translation is quite incorrect, and the passage is difficult. the reference seems to be to the supposition that the soul, apart from the body, sees both universals and particulars, but its power in the latter respect is impeded by the body; ideas taken from plato's meno and phædo. 32 , 33 . withholdeth , retains: 'tenet.' singularitees , particulars: 'singula.' 34 . in neither nother , put for in ne either ne other , i.e. not in one nor in the other; or, in modern english, 'he is neither in one position nor the other': 'neutro est habitu.' this curious phrase is made clearer by comparing it with the commoner either other . thus, in p. plowman, b. v. 148: ' either despiseth other '; in the same, b. v. 164: ' eyther hitte other '; and again, in b. xi. 173: 'that alle manere men .. louen her eyther other '; and, in b. vii. 138: 'apposeden either other '; and lastly, in b. xvi. 207: ' either is otheres ioye.' 36 . retreteth , reconsiders: 'altè uisa retractans .' prose 4. 2 . marcus tullius , i.e. cicero; de diuinatione, lib. ii. 60. 8 . moeven to : 'ad diuinae praescientiae simplicitatem non potest admoueri.' 15 . y-spended , spent; but the right sense of the latin is weighed or considered: 'si prius ea quibus moueris, expendero .' 22 . from elles-where : 'aliunde'; compare chaucer's gloss. 24 . unbityde , not happen: 'non euenire non possunt.' 27 . thou thyself. the reference is to bk. v. pr. 3. l. 27, above—'ne it ne bihoveth nat, nedes, that thinges bityden that ben purvyed.' 28 , 9 . what cause : 'quid est, quod uoluntarii exitus rerum ad certum cogantur euentum?' endes , results: 'exitus;' and so again below. 30 . by grace of position , for the sake of a supposition, by way of supposition: 'positionis gratia.' cf. chaucer's use of pose for 'suppose' in the next line. the reading possessioun (in both mss.) is obviously wrong; it sounds as if taken down from dictation. 31 . i pose , i suppose, i put the case: 'statuamus nullam esse praescientiam.' the words 'per impossibile' are inserted by chaucer, and mean, 'to take an impossible case.' 56 . but, certes, right ; only, indeed, just as, &c. it is difficult to give the right force intended; and, probably, chaucer quite mistook the sense. 'quasi uero nos ea, quae prouidentia futura esse praenoscit, non esse euentura credamus.' 62 . in the torninge : 'in quadrigis moderandis atque flectendis.' 63 . and by : 'atque ad hunc modum caetera.' 100 . and for that this thing shal mowen shewen , and in order that {458} this may appear (lit. may be able to appear). the whole clause merely means—'and to make this clearer by an easy example.' lat. 'nam ut hoc breui liqueat exemplo.' 101 . roundnesse is here in the objective case: 'eandem corporis rotunditatem aliter uisus aliter tactus agnoscit.' 107 . and the man : 'ipsum quoque hominem.' wit , i.e. sense. the 'five wits' were the five senses. 113 . spece , species. peces , parts; in the singuler peces , i.e. in the particular parts. 114 . intelligence , understanding; 'intelligentiae.' 115 . universitee , that which is universal: 'uniuersitatis ambitum.' 133 . by a strok : 'illo uno ictu mentis formaliter.' 137 . diffinissheth , defines the universality of her conception. metre 4. 1 . the porche ; in latin, porticus ; in gk. στοά , a roofed colonnade or porch in athens, frequented by zeno and his followers, who hence obtained the name of stoics. 'quondam porticus attulit obscuros nimium senes, qui sensus, et imagines e corporibus extimis credant mentibus imprimi.' 10 . text. the latin text continues thus :— 'vt quondam celeri stilo mos est aequore paginae quae nullas habeat notas, pressas figere litteras.' 11 . pointel ; see note to somn. tale, d 1742. and cf. troilus, i. 365; cant. ta. e 1581, 2. 15 . but yif : 'sed mens si propriis uigens nihil motibus explicat sed tantùm patiens iacet notis subdita corporum, cassasque in speculi uicem rerum reddit imagines. vnde haec sic animis uiget cernens omnia notio? quae uis singula prospicit, aut quae cognita diuidit? quae diuisa recolligit, alternumque legens iter nunc summis caput inserit, nunc desidit in infima, tum sese referens sibi, veris falsa redarguit?' 32 . passioun , passive feeling, impression: 'passio.' prose 5. 1 . but what yif ... and al be it so , nevertheless, even if it be so: 'quod si ... quamuis.' 4 . entalenten , affect, incline, stimulate: 'afficiant.' 18 . for the wit , i.e. the sense, the external senses. 21 . as oystres ... see : the latin merely has: 'quales sunt conchae maris.' 23 . remuable , capable of motion from place to place: 'mobilibus belluis.' talent , inclination, desire, wish: 'affectus.' 30 . but how ... yif that , but how will it be if? 33 . that that that , that that thing which. 35 . ne that ther nis , so that there is: 'nec quicquam esse sensibile.' {459} 49 . maner stryvinge , sort of strife: 'in huiusmodi igitur lite.' 62 . parsoneres , partners of, endowed with. the modern partner represents the m. e. parcener , variant of parsoner , from o. f. parsonier , representing a latin form *partitionarius . lat. 'participes.' 66 . for which : 'quare in illius summae intelligentiae cacumen, si possumus, erigamur.' metre 5. 1 . passen by , move over: 'permeant.' 6 . by moist fleeinge : 'liquido ... uolatu.' gladen hemself , delight: 'gaudent.' 7 . with hir goings ... feet : 'gressibus.' 9 . to walken under , to enter: 'subire.' 10 . enclined , i.e. enclined earthwards: 'prona.' 11 . hevieth , oppresses: 'prona tamen facies hebetes ualet ingrauare sensus.' from aristotle, on the parts of animals, bk. iv. διὸ πλείονος γενομένου τοῦ βάρους καὶ τοῦ σωματώδους, ἀνάγκη ῥέπειν τὰ σώματα πρὸς τὴν γῆν (chap. 10). as to the upright carriage of man, see the same chapter. cf. ovid, met. i. 84, and see note to chaucer's 'truth,' l. 19. 12 . light , i.e. not bowed down: 'leuis recto stat corpore.' 14 . axest , seemest to seek: 'caelum ... petis.' prose 6. 21 . as aristotle demed ; in de caelo, lib. i. 33 . present : 'et sui compos praesens sibi semper assistere.' 42 . plato. this notion is found in proclus and plotinus, and other followers of plato; but plato himself really expressed a contrary opinion, viz. that the world had a definite beginning. see his timæus. 48 . for this ilke : 'hunc enim uitae immobilis praesentarium statum infinitus ille temporalium rerum motus imitatur; cumque eum effingere atque aequare non possit, ex immobilitate deficit in motum, et ex simplicitate praesentiae decrescit in infinitam futuri ac praeteriti quantitatem;' &c. 53 . disencreseth ; a clumsy form for decreseth : 'decrescit.' 65 . therfor it : 'infinitum temporis iter arripuit.' 81 . it is science : 'sed scientiam nunquam deficientis instantiae rectius aestimabis.' 82 . for which : 'unde non praeuidentia, sed prouidentia, potius dicitur.' the footnote to l. 83 is wrong, as dr. furnivall's reprint of ms. c. is here at fault. that ms. (like ms. ii. 1. 38) has here the correct reading 'p re uydence,' without any gloss at all. the gloss 'p ro uidentia' belongs to the word 'purviaunce.' hence the reading 'previdence,' which i thought to be unsupported, is really supported by two good mss. 86 . why axestow ... thanne : 'quid igitur postulas?' 112 . he ne unwot : 'quod idem exsistendi necessitate carere non nesciat.' 116 . it ne may nat unbityde : 'id non euenire non posse.' 119 . but unnethe : 'sed cui uix aliquis nisi diuini speculator accesserit.' 150 , 1 . in beinge , in coming to pass: 'exsistendo.' {460} by the which : 'qua prius quam fierent, etiam non euenire potuissent.' ms. c. has the contraction for 'que,' i.e. 'quae'; but chaucer clearly adopted the reading 'qua.' the usual reading is 'quia' or 'quae.' 154 . so as they comen , since they come: 'cum ... eueniant.' 159 . the sonne arysinge. see above, p. 148, l. 102: 'right so,' &c. 185 . and thilke : 'illa quoque noscendi uices alternare uideatur?' 191 . for the devyne : 'omne namque futurum diuinus praecurrit intuitus, et ad praesentiam propriae cognitionis retorquet ac reuocat.' hence retorneth hem means 'makes them return.' 193 . ne he ne : 'nec alternat, ut existimas, nunc hoc, nunc illud praenoscendi uices; sed uno ictu mutationes tuas manens praeuenit atque complectitur.' 199 . a litel her-biforn. see above, bk. v. pr. 3, ll. 62-65; &c. 207 . purposen , propose, assign: 'proponunt.' 208 . to the willinges : 'solutis omni necessitate uoluntatibus.' 211 . renneth ... with , concurs with: 'concurrit.' 214 . put , set: 'positae.' that ne mowen : 'quae cum rectae sunt, inefficaces esse non possunt.' 217 . areys thy corage : 'animum subleuate.' yilde : 'humiles preces in excelsa porrigite.' 220 . sin that ye : 'cum ante oculos agitis iudicis cuncta cernentis.' with the word 'cernentis' the lat. treatise ends. the words—'to whom ... amen' occur in the cambridge ms. only; and, in all probability, were merely added by the scribe. however, the latin copy in that ms. adds, after 'cernentis,' the following: 'qui est dominus noster iesus christus, cui sit honor et gloria in secula seculorum. amen. ' {461} notes to troilus. book i. i must refer the student to mr. rossetti's work (chaucer soc. 1875) for a detailed comparison of chaucer's poem with the filostrato of boccaccio. the following table roughly indicates the portions of these works which are more or less similar, down to the end of book i. similar tables are prefixed to the notes on the other books. it often happens that a stanza in chaucer has a mere general resemblance to the corresponding one in boccaccio. the lines in chaucer not mentioned below are, in the main, original; e.g. 1-20, 31-56, &c.; and so are many others that cannot be here more exactly specified. chaucer: book i. filostrato. ll. 21-30. bk. i. st. v, vi. 57-213. vii-xxv. 267-329. xxvi-xxxii. 6. 354-392. xxxii. 7-xxxvii. 400-420. [petrarch: sonnet 88.] 421-546. xxxviii-lvii. 547-553. bk. ii. st. i. 568-630. ii-x. 645-7, 666-7, 675-6. xi. 1, xiii. 7, 8, xi, 7, 8. 680-686. xii. 701-3, 708-9, 722-3. xiii, xv. 1. 860-889. xvi, xvii, xx-xxii. 897-900. xxiii. 1-3. 967-1060. xxiv-xxxiv. 2 . 'that was the son of king priam of troy.' 5 . fro ye , from you; observe the rime. the form ye is not here the nom. case, but the unemphatic form of the acc. you ; pronounced (yə), where (ə) is the indefinite vowel, like the a in china . so in shak. two gent. iv. 1. 3, 4, we have about ye (unemphatic) in l. 3, and you twice in l. 4. 6 . thesiphone , tisiphone, one of the furies, invoked as being a 'goddess of torment.' cf. ' furial pyne of helle,' sq. ta. f 448. 13 . fere , companion; viz. tisiphone. {462} 16 . 'nor dare pray to love,' &c. 21 . cf. boccaccio: 'tuo sia l'onore, e mio si sia l'affanno,' fil. i. st. 5. and see ll. 1042, 3 below. 57 . here begins the story; cf. fil. i. st. 7. bell remarks that 'a thousand shippes,' in l. 58, may have been suggested by 'mille carinae' in verg. æn. ii. 198; cf. 'anni decem' in the same line, with l. 60. 67 . read éxpert . calkas is homer's calchas, il. i. 69. he was a greek, but guido makes him a trojan, putting him in the place of homer's chryses. see the allit. troy-book, 7886. 70 . delphicus , of delphi; cf. ovid, met. ii. 543. 77 . ye , yea. wolde who-so nolde , whoever wished it or did not wish it. this idiomatic phrase is thus expressed in the mss. bell's edition has wold who so or nolde , where the e in wolde is suppressed and the word or inserted without authority. i hesitate, as an editor, to alter an idiomatic phrase. cf. will he, nill he , in which there is no or . 91 . 'deserve to be burnt, both skin and bones.' 99 . criseyde ; boccaccio has griseida , answering to homer's χρυσηΐδα , il. i. 143. it was common, in the middle ages, to adopt the accusative form as the standard one, especially in proper names. her father was chryses; see note to l. 67. but benoît de sainte-maure calls her briseida , and chryseis and briseis seem to have been confused. the allit. troy-book has bresaide ; l. 8029. 119 . 'while it well pleases you'; good is used adverbially. ital. 'mentre t' aggrada.' 125 . 'and would have done so oftener, if,' &c. 126 . and hoom , and (went) home. 132, 133 . this is a curious statement, and chaucer's object in making it is not clear. boccaccio says expressly that she had neither son nor daughter (st. 15); and benoît (l. 12977) calls her 'la pucele.' 136 . som day , one day; used quite generally. 138 . 'and thus fortune wheeled both of them up and down again.' alluding to the wheel of fortune; see the ballade on fortune, l. 46, and note. 145 . troyane gestes , trojan history; cf. the title of guido delle colonne's book, viz. 'historia troiana,' which chaucer certainly consulted, as shewn by several incidents in the poem. 146 . omer , homer; whose account was considered untrustworthy by the medieval writers; see ho. fame, 1477, and note. dares , dares phrygius; dyte , dictys cretensis; see notes to ho. fame, 1467, 1468. these three authors really mean guido delle colonne, who professed to follow them. 153 . palladion , the palladium or sacred image of pallas, on the keeping of which the safety of troy depended. it was stolen from troy by diomede and ulysses; see æneid, ii. 166. but chaucer doubtless read the long account in guido delle colonne. 171 . hence henrysoun, in his testament of criseyde, st. 12, calls her 'the flower and a-per-se of troy and greece.' cf. 'she was a {463} woman a-per-se, alon'; romance of partenay, 1148. boccaccio's image is much finer; he says that she surpassed other women as the rose does the violet. on the other hand, l. 175 is chaucer's own. 172 . makelees , matchless, peerless; cf. a.s. gemaca . 189 . lakken , to blame; see p. pl. b. v. 132. 192 . bayten , feed, feast (metaphorically); e. bait . 205 . ascaunces , as if; in l. 292, the ital. text has quasi dicesse , as if she said. see cant. ta. d 1745, g 838. it is tautological, being formed from e. as and the o.f. quanses , as if (godefroy); so that the literal force is 'as as if.' 210 . 'and nevertheless [or, still] he (cupid) can pluck as proud a peacock (as was troilus).' cf. prol. a 652. 214-266 . these lines are chaucer's own. 217 . falleth , happens; ne wenden , would not expect. in ray's proverbs, ed. 1737, p. 279, is a scotch proverb—'all fails that fools thinks' ( sic ); which favours the alternative reading given in the footnote. 218 . bayard , a name for a bay horse; see can. yem. ta. g 1413. 229 . wex a-fere , became on fire. fere is a common southern form, as a variant of fyre , though a-fyre occurs in ho. fame, 1858. the a.s. vowel is ȳ , the a.s. form being fȳr . 239 . 'has proved (to be true), and still does so.' 257 . 'the stick that will bend and ply is better than one that breaks.' compare the fable of the oak and the reed; see bk. ii. 1387. 266 . ther-to refere , revert thereto. halliwell gives: ' refeere , to revert; hoccleve .' chaucer here ends his own remarks, and goes back to the filostrato . 292 . ascaunces , as if (she said); see note to l. 205. 316 . awhaped , amazed, stupefied; see anelida, 215; leg. of good women, 132, 814, 2321; he was 'not utterly confounded,' but only dazed; cf. l. 322. 327 . borneth , burnishes, polishes up; i.e. makes bright and cheerful. the rime shews that it is a variant spelling of burneth ; cf. burned , burnished, ho. fame, 1387; kn. ta. a 1983. ms. harl. 3943 has vnournith , an error for anorneth , adorns; with a like sense. 333 . him tit , to him betideth; tit is for tydeth . 336 . ordre , sect, brotherhood; a jesting allusion to the religious orders. so also ruled = under a religious rule. 337 . noun-certeyn , uncertainty; cf. o.f. noncerteit , uncertainty (godefroy); nounpower , want of power (p. plowman); and f. nonchalance . again spelt noun-certeyn , compl. venus, 46. 340 . lay , law, ordinance; see sq. ta. f 18. 344 . 'but observe this—that which ye lovers often avoid, or else do with a good intention, often will thy lady misconstrue it,' &c. 363 . a temple , i.e. in the temple. 381 . first stands alone in the first foot. cf. ll. 490, 603, 811. {464} 385 . yelt , short for yeldeth , yields. 394 . writ , writeth. lollius ; chaucer's reason for the use of this name is not known. perhaps we may agree with dr. latham, who suggested (in a letter to the athenæum , oct. 3, 1868, p. 433), that chaucer misread this line in horace ( epist. i. 2. 1), viz. 'troiani belli scriptorem, maxime lolli '; and thence derived the notion that lollius wrote on the trojan war. this becomes the more likely if we suppose that he merely saw this line quoted apart from the context. chaucer does not seem to have read horace for himself. as a matter of fact, ll. 400-420 are translated from the 88th sonnet of petrarch. see note to ho. of fame, 1468. the following is the text of petrarch's sonnet: 's'amor non è, che dunque è quel ch' i'sento? ma s'egli è amor, per dio, che cosa e quale? se buona, ond' è l'effetto aspro mortale? se ria, ond' è si dolce ogni tormento? s'a mia voglia ardo, ond' è 'l pianto e'l lamento? s'a mal mia grado, il lamentar che vale? o viva morte, o dilettoso male, come puoi tanto in me s'io nol consento? e s'io 'l consento, a gran torto mi doglio. fra si contrari venti, in frale barca mi trovo in alto mar, senza governo. sì lieve di saver, d'error sì carca ch' i' medesmo non so quel ch'io mi voglio, e tremo a mezza state, ardendo il verno.' in l. 401, whiche means 'of what kind.' 425 . ital. text—'non so s'io dico a donna, ovvero a dea'; fil. i. 38. cf. æneid, i. 327. hence the line in kn. ta. a 1101. 457 . that ; in modern e., we should use but , or else said not for seyde . 463 . fled-de is here a plural form, the pp. being treated as an adjective. cf. sprad-de , iv. 1422; whet-te , v. 1760. 464 . savacioun ; ital. 'salute.' mr. rossetti thinks that salute here means 'well-being' or 'health'; and perhaps savacioun is intended to mean the same, the literal sense being 'safety.' 465 . fownes , fawns; see book of the duch. 429. it is here used, metaphorically, to mean 'young desires' or 'fresh yearnings.' this image is not in boccaccio. 470 . i take the right reading to be felle , as in cm. ed., with the sense 'destructive.' as it might also mean 'happened,' other mss. turned it into fille , which makes a most awkward construction. the sense is: 'the sharp destructive assaults of the proof of arms [i.e. which afforded proof of skill in fighting], which hector and his other brothers performed, not once made him move on that account only'; i.e. when he exerted himself, it was not for mere fighting's sake. chaucer uses fel elsewhere; the pl. felle is in troil. iv. 44; and see cant. ta. d 2002, b 2019. for preve , proof, see l. 690. {465} 473, 4 . riden and abiden (with short i ) rime with diden , and are past tenses plural. l. 474 is elliptical: 'found (to be) one of the best, and (one of those who) longest abode where peril was.' 483 . the deeth , i.e. the pestilence, the plague. 488 . title , a name; he said it was 'a fever.' 517 . daunce , i.e. company of dancers. cf. ho. fame, 639, 640. 530-2 . 'for, by my hidden sorrow, (when it is) blased abroad, i shall be befooled more, a thousand times, than the fool of whose folly men write rimes.' no particular reference seems to be intended by l. 532; the ital. text merely has 'più ch' altro,' more than any one. 557 . attricioun , attrition. 'an imperfect sorrow for sin, as if a bruising which does not amount to utter crushing ( contrition ); horror of sin through fear of punishment ... while contrition has its motive in the love of god;' new e. dict. 559 . ley on presse , compress, diminish; cf. prol. a 81. 560 . holinesse , the leanness befitting a holy state. 626 . 'that one, whom excess causes to fare very badly.' 631-679 . largely original; but, for l. 635, see note to bk. iii. 329. 638-644 . there is a like passage in p. pl. c. xxi. 209-217. chaucer, however, here follows le roman de la rose, 21819-40, q.v. 648 . amayed , dismayed; o.f. esmaier . so in bk. iv. l. 641. 654 . oënone seems to have four syllables. ms. h. has oonone ; ms. cm. senome (over an erasure); ms. harl. 3943, tynome . alluding to the letter of œnone to paris in ovid, heroid. v. 659-665 . not at all a literal translation, but it gives the general sense of heroid. v. 149-152: 'me miseram, quod amor non est medicabilis herbis! deficior prudens artis ab arte mea. ipse repertor opis uaccas pauisse pheraeas fertur, et a nostro saucius igne fuit.' ipse repertor opis means phœbus, who 'first fond art of medicyne;' pheraeas , i.e. of pherae, refers to pherae in thessaly, the residence of king admetus. admetus gained alcestis for his wife by the assistance of apollo, who, according to some accounts, served admetus out of attachment to him, or, according to other accounts, because he was condemned to serve a mortal for a year. chaucer seems to adopt a theory that apollo loved admetus chiefly for his daughter's sake. the usual story about apollo is his love for daphne. 674 . 'even though i had to die by torture;' cf. kn. ta. a 1133. 686 . 'until it pleases him to desist.' 688 . 'to mistrust every one, or to believe every one.' 694 . the wyse , solomon; see eccles. iv. 10. 699 . niobe ; 'lacrimas etiamnum marmora manant;' ovid, met. vi. 311. 705 . 'that eke out (increase) their sorrows,' &c. 707 . 'and care not to seek for themselves another cure.' 708 . a proverb; see note to can. yem. ta. g 746. {466} 713 . harde grace , misfortune; cf. cant. ta. g 665, 1189. tyrwhitt quotes euripides, herc. furens, 1250: γέμω κακῶν δή, κὀυκέτ' ἐσθ' ὅπου τεθῇ . 730, 731 . from boethius, bk. i. pr. 2. l. 14, and pr. 4. l. 2. 739 . 'on whose account he fared so.' 740 . compare: 'he makes a rod for his own breech'; hazlitt's proverbs. 745 . 'for it (love) would sufficiently spring to light of itself.' 747 . cf. rom. de la rose, 7595-6. 763 . 'but they do not care to seek a remedy.' 780 . pronounced ben'cite ; see note to cant. ta. b 1170. 786 . ticius , tityos. ms. h2. wrongly has siciphus . 'the fowl that highte voltor , that eteth the stomak or the giser of tityus, is so fulfild of his song that it nil eten ne tyren no more;' tr. of boeth. bk. iii. met. 12. 28. the original has: 'vultur, dum satur est modis, non traxit tityi iecur.' see also verg. æn. vi. 595; ovid, met. iv. 456. 811 . first foot deficient, as in ll. 603, 1051, 1069, &c. winter , years. perhaps imitated from le rom. de la rose, 21145-9. 846, 847 . see boethius, bk. ii. pr. 3. 52-54. 848 . from boethius, lib. ii. pr. 1: 'si manere incipit, fors esse desistit.' see p. 26 above, l. 83. 887 . 'and, to augment all this the more.' 890-966 . this is all chaucer's own; so also 994-1008. 916 . a blaunche fevere , a fever that turns men white; said jocosely. lovers were supposed to be pale; ovid, art. am. i. 729. cotgrave is somewhat more precise. he gives: ' fievres blanches , the agues wherewith maidens that have the green sickness are troubled; hence, il a les fievres blanches , either he is in love, or sick of wantonness.' in the cuckoo and the nightingale, l. 41, we find: 'i am so shaken with the feveres white .' 932 . beet ; beat thy breast (to shew thy repentance). cf. p. plowm. b. v. 454. 956 . a proverb. 'the more haste, the worse speed (success).' cf. bk. iii. 1567, and the tale of melibeus, b 2244. 964 . dr. köppel says—cf. albertano of brescia, liber de amore dei, 45b: 'iam et seneca dixit, non conualescit planta, quae saepe transfertur.' 969 . 'a bon port estes arrivés'; rom. de la rose, 12964. 977 . fil. ii. st. 27: 'io credo certo, ch' ogni donna in voglia viva amorosa.' 1000 . post , pillar, support; as in prol. a 214. 1002 . cf. 'the greater the sinner, the greater the saint.' 1011 . understand he . 'he became, as one may say, untormented of his wo.' 1024 . cherl , man. 'you are afraid the man will fall out of the moon!' alluding to the old notion that the spots on the moon's surface {467} represent a man with a bundle of sticks. see the curious poem on this subject in wright's specimens of lyric poetry, p. 110; also printed in ritson's ancient songs, i. 68, and in böddeker's altenglische dichtungen, p. 176, where a fear is expressed that the man may fall out of the moon. cf. temp. ii. 2. 141; mids. nt. dr. v. 1. 249; and see alex. neckam, ed. wright, pp. xviii, 54. 1026 . 'why, meddle with that which really concerns you,' i.e. mind your own business. some copies needlessly turn this into a question and insert ne before hast . 1038 . 'and am i to be thy surety?' 1050 . scan : 'and yet m' athink'th ... m'asterte.' the sense is: 'and yet it repents me that this boast should escape me.' 1051 . deficient in the first foot: 'now | pandáre.' so in l. 1069. 1052 . 'but thou, being wise, thou knowest,' &c. in this line, thou seems to be emphatic throughout. 1058 . read désiróus ; as in book ii. 1101, and sq. ta. f 23. 1070 . pandare is here trisyllabic; with unelided -e . 1078 . the same line occurs in the clerk. ta. e 413. 1088 . 'and is partly well eased of the aching of his wound, yet is none the more healed; and, like an easy patient (i.e. a patient not in pain), awaits (lit. abides) the prescription of him that tries to cure him; and thus he perseveres in his destiny.' dryveth forth means 'goes on with,' or 'goes through with.' the reading dryeth , i.e. endures, is out of place here, as it implies suffering; whereas, at the present stage, troilus is extremely hopeful. book ii. the chief correspondences are shewn in the following table. chaucer: book ii. filostrato: book ii. ll. 265-6, 274-308. st. 35-37. 316-322. 46. 391-419, 428-455. 43, 54, 47-56. 501-523, 540-1. 55-57, 61. 554-578. 62-64. 584-588. 43. 589-602. 65, 66, 68. 645-665. 82-88, 71-78. 733-5, 746-763. 69, 70. 768-784. 73, 75-78. 937-8, 966-981. 79-81, 89. 995-1010. 90, 91. 1044-1104. 93-98, 100-109. 1125-1232. 109-128. 1305-1351. 128-131. other passages are mainly original; as, e.g. ll. 1352-1757 at the end, and 1-264 at the beginning. {468} 1-3 . these lines somewhat resemble dante, purgat. i. 1-3. 'per correr miglior acqua alza le vele omai la navicella del mio ingegno, che lascia dietro a sè mar sì crudele;' &c. 7 . calendes , the introduction to the beginning; see bk. v. l. 1634. thus the 'kalends of january' precede that month, being the period from dec. 14 to dec. 31. 8 . cleo ; so in most copies; h2. has clyo ; clio, the muse of history. 14 . latin seems, in this case, to mean italian, which was called latino volgare . 21 . 'a blind man cannot judge well of colours;' a proverb. 22 . doubtless from horace's ars poetica, 71-3; probably borrowed at second-hand. 28 . a proverb. in the proverbs of hendyng, l. 29, we have: 'ase fele thede, ase fele thewes,' i.e. so many peoples, so many customs. see l. 42 below. cf. boethius, bk. ii. pr. 7. 49 (p. 47). 36 . went , for wendeth ; i.e. goes; pres. tense. 46 . 'yet all is told, or must be told.' 48 . bitit , for bitydeth ; i.e. betides, happens. 55 . bole , bull, the sign taurus. on the third of may, in chaucer's time, the sun would be in about the 20th degree of taurus. the epithet white is from ovid, met. ii. 852. 63 . wente , sb., a turn; i.e. he tossed about. 64-68 . forshapen , metamorphosed. progne was changed into a swallow; ovid, met. vi. 668. tereus carried off progne's sister philomela; see leg. of good women (philomela). 74 . 'and knew that the moon was in a good plight (position) for him to take his journey.' that is, the moon's position was propitious; see note to man of lawes tale, b 312. 77 . ' janus , god of (the) entry;' see ovid, fasti, i. 125. 81 . 'and found (that) she and two other ladies were sitting.' sete (a. s. sǣton ) is the pt. t. pl., not the pp. 84 . the celebrated story of the siege of thebes, known to chaucer through the thebais of statius; see bk. v. 1484. and see l. 100. 87 . ey , eh! a note of exclamation, of frequent occurrence in the present poem. 103 . lettres rede , i.e. the rubric describing the contents of the next section. 100-105 . œdipus unwittingly slew his father laius; and the two sons of œdipus contended for thebes. for amphiorax , see note to bk. v. 1500, and to anelida, 57. 108 . bokes twelve ; the 12 books of the thebais. the death of amphioraus is related at the end of book vii. 110 . barbe , 'part of a woman's dress, still sometimes worn by nuns, consisting of a piece of white plaited linen, passed over or under the chin, and reaching midway to the waist;' new e. dict. she wore it {469} because she was a widow; see the quotations in the new e. dict., esp. 'wearing of barbes at funerals.' and see barbuta in ducange. 112 . 'let us perform some rite in honour of may;' see note to kn. ta. a 1500. 117 . the right reading is necessarily sete , for a. s. sǣte , 3 p. s. pt. t. subj. of sitten ; 'it would befit.' cf. seten , they sat, 81, 1192. 134 . 'and i am your surety,' i.e. you may depend upon me; see bk. i. 1038. 151 . unkouth , unknown, strange; hence, very; sc. unco' . 154 . wal , wall, defence; yerde , rod, scourge, as in bk. i. 740. 167 . from le rom. de la rose, 5684-6 :— 'lucan redit, qui moult fu sages, c'onques vertu et grant pooir ne pot nus ensemble veoir .' cf. lucan, phar. i. 92. 236 . withoute , excepting sweethearts; or, excepting by way of passionate love. the latter is the usual sense in chaucer. 273 . 'therefore i will endeavour to humour her intelligence.' 294 . so well bigoon , so well bestead, so fortunate. cf. parl. foules, 171. 318 . which ... his , whose; cf. that ... his , kn. ta. a 2710. 328 . 'then you have fished to some purpose;' ironical. to fish fair is to catch many fish. 329 . what mende ye , what do you gain, though we both lose? 344 . gems were supposed to have hidden virtues. 387 . fele , find out, investigate. 391, 2 . cf. ovid, art. amat. ii. 107: 'ut ameris, amabilis esto.' 393 . in the same, 113, we find: 'forma bonum fragile est,' &c. 396 . 'go and love; for, when old, no one will have you.' 398 . 'i am warned too late, when it has past away, quoth beauty.' 400 . the 'king's fool' got the hint from ovid, art. amat. ii. 118: 'iam uenient rugae,' &c. 403 . crowes feet , crow's feet; wrinkles at the corners of the eyes; from the shape. so in spenser, shep. kal. december , 136: 'and by myne eie the crow his clawe doth write.' 408 . breste a wepe , burst out a-weeping. 413 . ret , for redeth , advises; cf. p. plowman c. iv. 410, and note. 425 . pallas ; perhaps invoked with reference to the palladium of troy; bk. i. l. 153. moreover, pallas was a virgin goddess. 434 . 'of me no consideration need be taken.' 477 . 'except that i will not give him encouragement;' see 1222. 483 . 'but when the cause ceases, the disease ceases.' 507 . gon , gone; 'not very long ago.' 525 . mea culpa , by my fault; words used in confession: see p. plowman, b. v. 77, and note. 527 . ledest the fyn , guidest the end; cf. boeth. bk. iv. pr. 6. 149. 537 . biwryen , used in place of biwreyen , to bewray. the same rather arbitrary form appears in parl. foules, 348. {470} 539 . 'because men cover them up,' &c. 586 . were never , never would be; were is in the subjunctive mood. 611 . thascry , for the ascry , the alarm. ascry occurs in wyclif, prov. vii. 6. 615 . latis , lattice. the reading yates , gates, is wrong, as shewn by l. 617. 618 . dardanus, ancestor of priam. cf. dardanidae , i. e. trojans, verg. aen. i. 560, ii. 72, &c. troy had six gates, according to guido; the strongest of these was dardanus ; see the allit. destruction of troy, ed. panton and donaldson, l. 1557, lydgate, siege of troy, b. ii. c. 11, and shakespeare's prologue to his troilus. ther open is the cheyne , where the chain is open, or unfastened. alluding to the chains sometimes drawn across a street, to block it against horsemen. the sense is, 'he will come down this street, because the others are blocked.' 621 . happy , fortunate. it was a lucky day for him. 627 . a pas , at a foot-pace; see prol. a 825, and l. 620 above. 637 . an heven , a beautiful sight; cf. sq. ta. f 558. 639 . tissew , lace, twisted band; from f. tistre , to weave. 642 . the shield was covered with horn, sinews or nerf , and skin or rind . 651 . 'who has given me a love-potion?' 656 . for pure ashamed , for being completely ashamed, i.e. for very shame. a curious idiom. 666 . envýous , envious person; accented on y , as in l. 857. 677 . ma | de ; two syllables. the first foot is imperfect. 681 . the astrological term 'house' has two senses; it sometimes means a zodiacal sign, as when, e.g. taurus is called the 'house' or mansion of venus; and sometimes it has another sense, as, probably, in the present passage. see chaucer's treatise on the astrolabe, pt. ii. § 37, on 'the equations of houses.' in the latter case, the whole celestial sphere was divided into twelve equal parts, called 'houses,' by great circles passing through the north and south points of the horizon. the first of these, reckoning upwards from the eastern horizon, was called the first house, and the seventh house, being opposite to it, was reckoned downwards from the western horizon. the first and seventh houses were both considered very fortunate; and it is here said that venus was in her seventh house, i.e. was just below the western horizon at the moment when criseyde first saw him. the same planet was also 'well disposed,' i.e. in a favourable sign of the zodiac; and at the same time was 'pleased (or made propitious) by favourable aspects' of other planets, i.e. other planets were favourably situated as regards their angular distances from venus. moreover, venus was no foe to troilus in his nativity, i.e. she was also favourably situated at the moment of his birth. 716 . imitated from le rom. de la rose, 5765-9, q.v. 746 . 'i am one (who is) the fairest.' the -e in fairest-e is not elided; neither is the -e in wist-e in l. 745. {471} 750 . i.e. 'i am my own mistress.' 752 . lese , pasture; 'i stand, unfastened, in a pleasant pasture.' from a. s. lǣsu . cf. ho. fame, 1768. it does not mean 'leash,' as usually said; chaucer's form of 'leash' is lees , as in cant. ta. g 19. 754 . chekmat , check-mate, as in chess; see book duch. 659. bell sees a pun in it; ' check to my mate ,' i.e. wife; but it remains to be shewn that the form mate (wife) was known to chaucer, who spells it make (cant. ta. e 2080). 759 . i.e. 'i am not a nun,' nor vowed to chastity. 767, 769 . sprat , for spredeth , spreads, pres. t.; spradde , pt. t. cf. boethius, bk. i. met. 3. 9-12. 777 . according to bell, ms. harl. 1239 also has why , i.e. wherefore, a reason why, cause. 784 . cf. 's'il fait folie, si la boive;' rom. rose, 12844. 797 . 'no one stumbles over it;' for it is too unsubstantial. 802 . 'yet all things seem to them to be harmful, wherein folks please their friends.' 807 . 'nothing venture, nothing have.' 830 . hertes lust , heart's pleasure; to rente , by way of rent. 831 . no wight , to no one; dat. case. 861 . see hazlitt's notes on the proverb—'many talk of robin hood, that never shot in his bow,' &c. 866 . 'who cannot endure sorrow deserves no joy.' 867 . 'and therefore let him, who has a glass head, beware of stones cast in battle.' 882 . let , short for ledeth , leads (stratmann). 884 . the mss. end the line with syke . it has been pointed out that syke is not a perfect rime to endyte , whyte , but only an assonance. it is difficult to believe chaucer guilty of this oversight; and hence i would suggest, with all submission to the critics, that possibly chaucer wrote syte . the m. e. syte means to be anxious, and occurs in the cursor mundi, 11675; where joseph says to mary:—'bot i site for an other thing that we o water has nu wanting,' i.e. but i am anxious about another thing, that we lack water. the sb. site , grief, occurs in the midland dialect as well as in northumbrian; see site in stratmann. as the word is unusual, it would naturally be altered by the scribes to the familiar syke , to sigh, with a cognate meaning. 920 . 'and loude he song ageyn the sonne shene;' kn. ta. a 1509. 959 . 'unless lack of pursuit is the cause (of failure),' &c.; cf. 1075. 964 . hameled , cut off, docked; cf. p. pl. crede, 300. 1001 . 'your ill hap is not owing to me.' 1017 . read and úpon mé , where me is emphatic. 1022 . when people's ears glow, it is because they are being talked of; according to folk-lore. see brand's popular antiquities, ed. ellis, iii. 171. 1026 . 'sed lateant uires, nec sis in fronte disertus;' ovid, art. am. i. 463. {472} 1027 . 'quascunque adspicies, lacrimae fecere lituras;' ovid, heroid. iii. 3. 1033 . 'or always harp one tune.' 1041 . 'humano capiti,' &c.; horace, ars poet. 1-5. pyk , a pike (fish), as in the balade to rosemounde, 17. 1062 . accent mínervá on the first and third syllables. 1075-7 . it made , was the cause of it. ley , lied. 1107 . hoppe , dance. 'i always dance in the rear.' 1108 . to-laugh (h2, to lagh , cm. to law ), laughed exceedingly. i know of no other example. a better form is to-lough ; see l. 1163, and pard. ta. c 476. 1119 . spek-e , might speak, should say; pt. t. subjunctive. 1123 . sent , i. e. sendeth , sends; the pt. t. is sent-e or send-e . 1177-8 . avysed , she took notice; pt. tense. so also fond , found, which bell takes to be a pp.; but the pp. is founden . coude good , knew what was becoming. so, in l. 1197, can he means 'has he skill.' 1201, 1204 . sowe , to sew the pieces of parchment together. tyrwhitt remarks, s. v. sowe ; 'it was usual, and indeed necessary, formerly to sew letters, when they were written upon parchment; but the practice continued long after the invention of paper.' plyte , to fold it up. 1229 . 'a cushion, beaten with gold;' cf. kn. ta. a 979. 1238 . a proverb: 'slight impressions soon fade.' 1249 . tyrwhitt, s. v. somme , boggles over this line, but it is quite right. bell takes occasion to speak of the 'rugged lines' to be found in this poem; which is true enough of his own peculiar text. in beowulf, l. 207, we have fiftēna sum , one of fifteen, where the cardinal number is used; and this is the usual idiom. but the ordinal number is used also. in st. juliana, p. 79, we read that 'te sea sencte him on his thrituthe sum ,' the sea drowned him and 'thirtieth some' of his men, which i understand to mean 'and twenty-nine of his men,' the master being the thirtieth; but mr. cockayne and mr. bradley make it mean 'him and thirty others.' so again, in sir tristrem, 817, we have: 'he busked and made him yare hi[s] fiftend som of knight,' he made ready for himself his 'fifteenth some' of knights, which i should explain to mean a band of fifteen knights, himself included , or, himself being the fifteenth. some in such phrases has a collective force. however, the examples in bosworth and toller's a. s. dict., s. v. sum , shew that this mode of expression is also sometimes used exclusively of the leader. 1274 . on to pyke , for her to pick upon, or pick at; i. e. for her to pull out; see l. 1273. see examples in halliwell, s. v. pike , of 'to pyke out thornes,' to pick out thorns. 1276 . cf. 'to strike while the iron is hot;' see melibeus, b 2226. 1289 . 'but therein he had much to heave at and to do.' 1291 . 'and why? for fear of shame.' cm. has for speche , i. e. for fear of talk or scandal. 1315 . accesse , attack, as of fever. see new e. dict. {473} 1343 . refreyde , grow cool; cf. balade to rosemounde, l. 21. 1349 . after his gestes , according to his deeds, or adventures. 1390 . forbyse , to give (thee) instances. hardly a correct form; it should rather be forbysne , short for forbysnen , as the verb is formed from the sb. forbysne , a. s. forebȳsen , an example, instance. the word was obsolescent. 1398 . deiphebus (= dé'phĕbús) is always trisyllabic. 1410 . he means that he would do more for him than for any one, 'except for him whom he loves most,' i. e. troilus. 1427 . 'with spur and whip,' i. e. with all expedition. 1495 . word and ende , beginning and end; cf. iii. 702, v. 1669. the right phrase is ord and ende , where ord is 'beginning;' but it would seem that, by chaucer's time, word had been corruptly substituted for the obsolescent ord . see monk. ta. b 3911, and the note. 1534 . triste , station for a huntsman to shoot from. see tristre in stratmann. 1554 . renne , to run, like an excited madman. 1564 .

'perhaps it means, in regard for the king and queen, his parents;' bell. my own guess is different. i think it quite possible that chaucer is referring to the two 'crowns' or garlands, one of roses and one of lilies, about which so much is said in his early work entitled the lyf of seint cecile , afterwards called the second nonnes tale (see g 270). thus pandarus, with his usual impudence, conjures criseyde to pity troilus by two solemn adjurations, viz. for the sake of him who gave us all our souls, and by the virtue of the two heavenly crowns which an angel once brought to a chaste couple . he thus boldly insinuates that the proposed meeting is of the most innocent character. this i take to be the whole point of the allusion. 1737 . 'fie on the devil!' i. e. despise detraction. 1738 . com of , come off; we now say 'come on!' see ll. 1742, 1750. 1751 . 'but now (i appeal) to you.' 1752 . cankedort , a state of suspense, uncertainty, or anxiety; as appears from the context. the word occurs nowhere else. only one ms. (h2) has the spelling kankerdort , usually adopted in modern editions; thynne has cankedorte , but it needs no final e . the etymology is unknown nor do we even know how to divide it. there is a verb kanka , to shake, be unsteady, &c., in swedish dialects (rietz), and the swed. ort is a place, quarter; if there is any relationship, kanked-ort might mean 'shaky place,' or ticklish position. another theory is that canker relates to canker , a cancer, disease, and that dort is related to lowl. sc. dort , sulkiness. but this is assuming {474} that the right spelling is canker-dort , a theory which the mss. do not favour. neither does the sense of 'ill-humour' seem very suitable. as i am bound, in this difficult case, to suggest what i can, i must add that it is also possible to suppose that cankedort is of french origin, answering to an o. f. quant que dort , lit. 'whenever he is asleep (?),' or 'although he is asleep(?);' and hence (conceivably) meaning 'in a sleepy state.' the phrase quant que , also spelt kan ke (and in many other ways) is illustrated by a column of examples in godefroy's dictionary; but its usual sense is 'as well as,' or 'whatever'; thus kan ke poet = as well as he can. or can we make it = com ki dort , like one who sleeps? book iii. the following scheme gives a general idea of the relationship of this book to the original. chaucer: book iii. filostrato: book iii. ll. 1-38. st. 74-79. 239-287. 5-10. 344-441. 11-20. 813-833.

[boethius, ii. pr. 4. 4-10.] 1639-1680. 61-65. 1695-1743. 70-73. 1744-1768. [boethius, ii. met. 8.] 1772-1806. 90-93. 1807-1813. bk. i, st. 3. 1. 1-38 . this is an exceptionally difficult passage, and some of the editions make great nonsense of it, especially of ll. 15-21. it is, however, imitated from stanzas 74-79 of the filostrato, book iii; where the invocation is put into the mouth of troilus. the key to it is that it is an address to venus , both the planet and the goddess. 2 . the planet venus was considered to be in 'the third heaven.' the 'heavens' or spheres were named, respectively, after the moon, mercury, venus, sun, mars, jupiter, saturn, and the 'fixed stars;' beyond which was the primum mobile, the earth being in the centre of all, and immoveable. sometimes the spheres of the seven planets were reckoned backwards from saturn, venus being then in the fifth heaven; see lenvoy a scogan, 9, and the note. {475} 3 . 'o favourite of the sun, o dear daughter of jove!' venus was considered a fortunate planet. perhaps it is best to quote the italian text here :— 585 'o luce eterna, il cui lieto splendore fa bello il terzo ciel, dal qual ne piove piacer, vaghezza, pietade ed amore; del sole amica, e figliuola di giove, benigna donna d'ogni gentil core, 590 certa cagion del valor che mi muove a' sospir dolci della mia salute, sempre lodata sia la tua virtute. il ciel, la terra, lo mare e l'inferno ciascuno in sè la tua potenzia sente, 595 o chiara luce; e s'io il ver discerno, le piante, i semi, e l'erbe puramente, gli uccei, le fiere, i pesci con eterno vapor ti senton nel tempo piacente, e gli uomini e gli dei, nè creatura 600 senza di te nel mondo vale o dura. tu giove prima agli alti affetti lieto, pe' qua' vivono e son tutte le cose, movesti, o bella dea; e mansueto sovente il rendi all' opere noiose 605 di noi mortali; e il meritato fleto in liete feste volgi e dilettose; e in mille forme già quaggiù il mandasti, quand' ora d'una ed or d'altra il pregasti. 11 . vapour , influence; ital. vapor (l. 598). 15 . the readings in this stanza are settled by the ital. text. thus, in ll. 17, 19, 20, read him , not hem . comeveden , didst move or instigate; agreeing with ye , for which mod. e. uses thou . 'thou didst first instigate jove to those glad effects (influences), through which all things live and exist; and didst make him amorous of mortal things; and, at thy pleasure, didst ever give him, in love, success or trouble; and, in a thousand forms, didst send him down to (gain) love on earth; and he caught those whom it pleased you (he should catch).' in l. 17 we find comeveden sometimes turned into comenden , or even commodious ! the italian text has movesti (l. 603). 22 . venus was supposed to appease the angry planet mars; see compl. of mars, 36-42. 27 . 'according as a man wishes.' 29 . 'tu in unità le case e li cittadi, li regni, ... tien.' 31-34 . 'tu sola le nascosi qualitadi delle cose conosci, onde 'l costrutto vi metti tal, che fai maravigliare chi tua potenza non sa riguardare.' {476} i. e. 'thou only knowest the hidden qualities of things, whence thou formest such a construction, that thou makest to marvel any one who knows not how to estimate thy power.' chaucer seems to have used construe because suggested by costrutto , but he really uses it as answering to sa (in the fourth line), and omits the words 'l costrutto vi metti tal altogether. hence ll. 33-35 mean: 'when they cannot explain how it may come to pass that she loves him , or why he loves her ; (so as to shew) why this fish, and not that one, comes to the weir.' io (= jo ), come to pass. this word is not in the dictionaries, and has been coolly altered into go (!) in various editions. but it answers to o. f. joer (f. jouer ), to play, hence, to play a game, to make a move (as in a game); here, to come about, come to pass. 35 . were , weir, pool where fish are caught; see parl. foules, 138, and note. 36 . 'you have imposed a law on folks in this universe;' ital. 'tu legge, o dea, poni all' universo.' 44, 45 . inhelde , pour in. caliope , calliope, muse of epic poetry; similarly invoked by dante, purg. i. 9. 87 . 'though he was not pert, nor made difficulties; nor was he too bold, (as if about) to sing a mass for a fool.' the last expression was probably proverbial; it seems to mean to speak without hesitation or a feeling of respect. 115 . to watre wolde , would turn to water; cf. squi. ta. f 496. 120 . ' i? what? ' i. e. 'i? what (am i to do)?' in l. 122, pandarus repeats her words, mockingly: 'you say i? what? why, of course you should pity him.' 136-138 . 'and i (am) to have comfort, as it pleases you, (being at the same time) under your correction, (so as to have what is) equal to my offence, as (for instance) death.' see cant. ta. b 1287. 150 . 'by the feast of jupiter, who presides over nativities.' the reason for the use of natal is not obvious. cf. 'scit genius, natale comes qui temperat astrum;' horat. ep. ii. 2. 187. 188 . 'i seem to hear the town-bells ringing for this miracle, though no hand pulls the ropes.' 193, 194 . and oon, and two , 'both the one of you and the other.' 198 . bere the belle , take the former place, take precedence; like the bell-wether that heads the flock. see the new e. dict. 228 . 'straight as a line,' i. e. directly, at once. 294 . see manc. ta. h 333, and note. 299 . 'thou understandest and knowest enough proverbs against the vice of gossiping, even if men spoke truth as often as they lie.' 308 . 'no boaster is to be believed, in the natural course of things.' 328, 329 . drat , dreadeth. cf. 'felix, quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.' but chaucer took it from le rom. de la rose, 8041-2: 'moult a benéurée vie cil qui par autrui se chastie.' 340 . 'and a day is appointed for making up the charters' (which will particularise what she has granted you); metaphorical. {477} 349 . richesse , abundance; not a happy word, but suggested by the ital. text: 'i sospir ch'egli aveva a gran dovizia;' fil. iii. 11. dovizia (lat. diuitiae ) is precisely 'richesse.' bell has rehetyng , i. e. comforting (from o. f. rehaiter , reheiter ), which gives no sense; and explains it by ' reheating !' 354 . lusty , lusty person; cf. cant. ta. a 165, 208. 377 . 'or durst (do so), or should know (how).' 380 . stokked , fastened in the stocks; cf. acts xvi. 24. 404 . departe it so , make this distinction. 410 . frape , company, troop. marked by tyrwhitt as not understood. other examples occur. 'with hem a god gret frape ;' adam davy, &c., ed. furnivall, p. 60, col. 1, text 3, l. 390; and see allit. morte arthure, ed. brock, 2163, 2804, 3548. godefroy gives o. f. frap , a multitude, and frapaille , rabble. 445 . 'and wished to be seised of that which he lacked.' 497 . 'or to enumerate all the looks and words of one that is in such uncertainty.' 502 . as seith ; but it does not appear that boccaccio says anything of the kind. the same remark applies to l. 575. 510 . fulfelle is a kentish form, the e answering to a. s. y . similar forms occur in gower. see note to book duch. 438. 526 . scan: dréd | elées | it cleer,' &c. the sense is: 'it was clear, in the direction of the wind, from every magpie and every spoil-sport.' i. e. no one could detect them; they kept (like hunters) well to leeward, and there were no magpies or telltale birds to windward, to give an alarm. 529 . scan: in this matér-e, both-e frem'd. fremed , strange, wild. 542 . holy , i. e. sacred to apollo. from ovid, met. i. 566: 'laurea .. uisa est agitasse cacumen.' 545 . 'and therefore let no one hinder him.' 572 . the readings all shew various corruptions of thurfte , which none of the scribes understood; see thurfen , tharf , in stratmann. this is not the only place where thurfte has been ousted from the text. cf. thar (for tharf ) in the reves ta. a 4320, &c. yow thurfte have , you would need (to) have. yow is the dat. case, governed by the impers. verb. the reading yow durste turns yow (an accusative) into an imaginary nominative; but the nom. form is ye , which the scribes did not venture to substitute. 584 . goosish , goose-like, silly. this delicious epithet was turned into gofysshe by thynne, and modern editions perpetuate the blunder. tyrwhitt derived gofish from f. goffe , a word which is much later than chaucer, and was probably merely adapted from ital. goffo , stupid. the century dict. goes a step further, inserting a second f , and producing a form goffish , against all authority. cf. parl. foules, 568, 586. 601 . stewe , small chamber, closet; cf. g. stube . 602 . 'where he was shut in, as in a coop.' {478} 609 . 'there was no dainty to be fetched'; they were all there. 614 . wade ; this is the hero mentioned in the merch. tale, e 1424; see note. 617-620 . cf. boethius, bk. iv. pr. 6. 60-68. 622 . 'without her leave, at the will of the gods.' 624 . bente , i. e. curved, crescent; see l. 549. cf. boeth. bk. i. met. 5. 6, 7. 625 . the moon, saturn, and jupiter were all in conjunction in cancer, which was the mansion of the moon. we are to understand that this caused the great rain. 640 . ron , rained; so also in l. 677. the usual pt. t. is reinede , but we also find roon , ron , as in p. plowm. b. xiv. 66 (c. xvi. 270), and in trevisa, tr. of higden, ii. 239. the pt. t. of a. s. rignan , rīnan , is usually rīnde ; but the strong pt. rān occurs in the blickling glosses. 648 . a game , in game; a = an , on ; cm. has on . 671 . the wyn anon , the wine (shall come) at once; alluding to the wine drunk just before going to bed. see prol. a 819, 820. 674 . 'the voidè being drunk, and the cross-curtain drawn immediately afterwards.' the best reading is voyde or voydee . this seems to be here used as a name for the 'loving-cup' or 'grace-cup,' which was drunk after the table had been cleared or voided . properly, it was a slight dessert of 'spices' and wine; where spices meant sweetmeats, dried fruits, &c. see notes and queries, 2 s. xi. 508. the traverse was a screen or curtain drawn across the room; cf. cant. ta. e 1817; king's quair, st. 90. see additional note, p. 506 . 690 . this refers to the attendants. they were no longer allowed to skip about (run on errands) or to tramp about noisily, but were packed off to bed, with a malediction on those who stirred about. traunceth , tramps about, is used of a bull by gower, c. a. ii. 72. in beaumont and fletcher, fair maid of the inn, v. 2, we find—'but, traunce the world over, you shall never,' &c. for traunce , thynne reads praunce , which has a similar sense. morris explains traunce here as a sb., which seems impossible. 695 . the olde daunce , the old game; see prol. a 476. 696 . sey , saw; perhaps read seye , subj., might perceive. if so, read al , i. e. every. 702 . 'beginning and end;' see note to bk. ii. 1495. 711 . i. e. or else upset everything; cf. the phrase, 'all the fat is in the fire.' 716 . mars and saturn both had an evil influence. 717 . combust , quenched, viz. by being too near the sun; see astrolabe, pt. ii. § 4. venus and mercury, when thus 'combust,' lost their influence. let , hindered. 721 . adoon , adonis; see ovid, met. x. 715. 722 . europe , europa; see leg. of good women, 113, and note. 725 . cipris , venus; see ho. fame, 518. 726 . dane , daphne; see kn. ta. a 2062. {479} 729 . mercúrie , mercury; herse , daughter of cecrops, beloved by mercury. her sister, aglauros, had displeased minerva ( pallas ); whereupon minerva made aglauros envious of herse. mercury turned aglauros into stone because she hindered his suit. see ovid, met. ii. 708-832. 733 . 'fatal sisters;' i.e. the fates, clotho, lachesis, and atropos. 'which spun my destiny, before any cloth (infant's covering) was made for me.' see kn. ta. a 1566; leg. g. wom. 2629. 764 . let sleeping dogs lie; a proverb. 773 . 'to hold in hand' is to feed with false hopes, to delude by pretended love. 775 . lit. 'and make him a hood above a cap.' a calle (caul) was a close-fitting cap, a skull-cap. to put on a hood over this evidently means to cover up the eyes, to cajole, to hoodwink. 791 , 797 . shal , owe to. sholde love , i.e. are reported to love. 813-836 . founded on boethius, lib. ii. pr. 4. 'quàm multis amaritudinibus humanae felicitatis dulcedo respersa est!... anxia enim res est humanorum conditio bonorum, et quae uel numquam tota proueniat, uel numquam perpetua subsistat.... ad haec, quem caduca ista felicitas uehit, uel scit eam, uel nescit esse mutabilem. si nescit, quaenam beata sors esse potest ignorantiae caecitate? si scit, metuat necesse est, ne amittat, quod amitti potest non dubitat; quare continuus timor non sinit esse felicem.... quonam modo praesens uita facere beatos potest?' see the e. version, ll. 86, 56, 109. 839 . 'why hast thou made troilus distrust me?' 853, 854 . 'danger is drawn nearer by delay.' we say, 'delays are dangerous.' cf. havelok, l. 1352. abodes , abidings, tarryings. 855 . néc' , with elided e , forms the first foot. 'every thing has its time;' cf. eccl. iii. 1. 861 . farewel feldefare , (and people will say) farewell, fieldfare! cf. rom. rose, 5510. in the rom. rose, it refers to false friends, who, when fortune frowns, say 'go! farewell fieldfare,' i.e. begone, we have done with you. as fieldfares come here in the winter months, people are glad to see them go, as a sign of approaching summer. in the present case, the sense appears to be that, when an opportunity is missed, the harm is done; and people will cry, 'farewell, fieldfare!' by way of derision. we might paraphrase the line by saying: 'the harm is done, and nobody cares.' 885 . blewe , blue; the colour of constancy . 890 . 'hazle-bushes shake.' this is a truism known to every one, and no news at all; in like manner, your ring will tell him nothing, and is useless. 901 . feffe him , enfeoff him, bestow on him. whyte , fair. 919 . at pryme face , at the first glance; primâ facie . 931 . at dulcarnon , at a non-plus, in extreme perplexity. dulcarnon , as pointed out by selden, in his pref. to drayton's polyolbion, represents the pers. and arab. dū’lkarnayn , lit. two-horned; from pers. dū , {480} two, and karn , horn. it was a common medieval epithet of alexander the great, who was so called because he claimed descent from jupiter ammon, whose image was provided with horns like a ram. speght rightly says that dulcarnon was also a name for the 47th prop. of euclid, book i, but gives a false reason and etymology. the real reason is plain enough, viz. that the two smaller squares in the diagram stick up like two horns. and, as this proposition is somewhat difficult for beginners, it here takes the sense of 'puzzle;' hence criseyde was at dulcarnon , because she was in perplexity. speght refers to alex. neckam, de naturis rerum; see wright's edition, p. 295. but this is not all. in l. 933, pandarus explains that dulcarnon is called 'fleming of wrecches.' there is a slight error here: 'fleming of wrecches,' i.e. banishment of the miserable, is a translation of fuga miserorum , which is written opposite this line in ms. harl. 1239; and further, fuga miserorum is a sort of latin translation of eleëfuga or eleufuga , from ἔλεος pity, and φυγή , flight. the error lies in confusing dulcarnon , the 47th proposition, with eleufuga , a name for the 5th proposition; a confusion due to the fact that both propositions were considered difficult. roger bacon, opus tertium, cap. 6, says: 'quinta propositio geometricae euclidis dicitur elefuga , id est, fuga miserorum .' ducange, s. v. eleufuga , quotes from alanus, anticlaudiani lib. iii. cap. 6—'huius tirones curantis [ read cur artis] eleufuga terret,' &c. the word also occurs in richard of bury's philobiblon, cap. xiii, somewhat oddly translated by j.b. inglis in 1832. 'how many scholars has the helleflight of euclid repelled!' this explanation, partly due to the rev. w.g. clark (joint-editor of the globe shakespeare), was first given in the athenæum , sept. 23, 1871, p. 393, in an article written by myself. 934 . it , i.e. dulcarnon , or euclid's proposition. 'it seems hard, because the wretched pupils will not learn it, owing to their very sloth or other wilful defects.' 936 . this = this is ; as elsewhere. fecches , vetches. 947 . understand be ; 'where (i hope) good thrift may be.' cf. 966. 978 . fere , fire; as in bk. i. 229. usually fyre . 979 . fond his contenaunce , lit. found his demeanour, i.e. composed himself as if to read. 1010 . wivere , viper; o. f. wivre (f. givre ), from lat. uipera . the heraldic wiver or wyvern became a wondrous winged dragon, with two legs; wholly unlike the original viper. see thynne's animadversions, &c., ed. furnivall, p. 41. 1013 . 'alas! that he, either entirely, or a slice of him.' 1021 . 'that sufferest undeserved jealousy (to exist).' 1029 . after that , accordingly; his , its. 1035 . see note to bk. ii. 784. 1046 . ordal , ordeal, trial by ordeal, i.e. by fire or water. see thynne's animadversions, ed. furnivall, p. 66. 1056 . wreigh , covered; a. s. wrāh ; see wrīhen in stratmann. {481} 1064 . shoures , assaults. bell actually substitutes stouris , as being 'clearly the true reading.' but editors have no right to reject real words which they fail to understand. shour sometimes means a shower of arrows or darts, an assault, &c.; cf. a.s. hildescūr , a flight of missiles. in fact, it recurs in this sense in bk. iv. 47, where bell again turns it into stoure , against authority. 1067 . 'for it seemed to him not like (mere) strokes with a rod ... but he felt the very cramp of death.' 1106 . al forgeve , all is forgiven. stint , stopped. 1154 . bar him on honde , assured him. 1177 . 'for a crime, there is mercy (to be had).' 1194 . sucre be or soot , may be like sugar or like soot, i.e. pleasant or the reverse. we must read soot (not sote , sweet, as in bell) because it rimes with moot . moreover, soot was once proverbially bitter. 'bittrore then the sote' occurs in altenglische dichtungen, ed. boddeker, p. 121; and in rutebuef's vie sainte marie l'egiptianne, ed. jubinal, 280, we find 'plus amer que suie;' cf. rom. rose, 10670: 'amer plus que n'est suie.' 1215 . cf. 'bitter pills may have sweet effects;' hazlitt's proverbs. 1231 . bitrent , for bitrendeth , winds round; cf. iv. 870. wryth , for wrytheth , writhes. 1235 . 'when she hears any shepherd speak.' 1249 . 'and often invoked good luck upon her snowy throat.' 1257 . welwilly , full of good will, propitious. 1258 . imeneus , hymenæus, hymen; cf. ovid, her. xiv. 27. 1261-4 . imitated from dante, parad. xxxiii. 14 :— 'che qual vuol grazie, e a te non ricorre, sua disianza vuol volar senz' ali. la tua benignità non pur soccorre,' &c. 1282 . 'mercy prevails over (lit. surpasses) justice.' 1344 . 'or else do i dream it?' 1357 . sooth , for sooth is , i.e. it is true. 1369 . bell takes scripture to mean the mottos or posies on the rings. perhaps this is right. 1374 . holt , holds; 'that holds it in despite.' 1375 . 'of the money, that he can heap up and lay hold of.' for mokren , cf. chaucer's boethius, bk. ii. pr. 5. 11. pens , pence, is a translation of ital. denari , money, in the filostrato, book iii. st. 38. 1384 . the whyte , silver coins; the rede , gold coins. 1389 . myda , midas; see wyf of bathes tale, d 951. 1391 . crassus ; wantonly altered to cresus in bell's edition, on the ground that the story is told of croesus. but chaucer knew better. m. crassus, surnamed dives (the rich), was slain in battle against the parthians, b. c. 53. orodes, king of parthia, caused molten gold to be poured into the mouth of his dead enemy, saying, 'sate thyself now with that metal of which, in life, thou wast so greedy;' cicero, att. vi. 1. 14; florus, iii. 11. 4. {482} 1407 . 'and to counterbalance with joy their former woe'. 1415 . the cock is called a common astrologer (i. e. astronomer), because he announces to all the time of day; cf. non. pr. ta. b 4043; parl. foules, 350. translated from 'vulgaris astrologus;' alanus. 1417, 9 . lucifer , the morning-star, the planet venus. fortuna maior , the planet jupiter. mars and saturn were supposed to have an evil influence; the sun, mercury, and moon, had no great influence either way; whilst jupiter and venus had a good influence, and were therefore called, respectively, fortuna maior and fortuna minor . see g. douglas, ed. small, ii. 288. the mss. have that anoon , (it happened) that anon; but this requires us to suppose so awkward an ellipsis that it is better to read than , answering to whan . 1428 . almena , alcmena; a note in ms. h. has: 'almena mater herculis.' alcmena was the mother of hercules by jupiter. jupiter lengthened the night beyond its usual limit. plautus has a play on the subject, called amphitruo , as jupiter personated amphitryon. 1437-9 . ther , wherefore; 'wherefore (i pray that) god, creator of nature, may bind thee so fast to our hemisphere,' &c. a similar construction occurs in l. 1456. 1453 . bore , aperture, chink; 'for every chink lets in one of thy bright rays.' see new e. dict. 1462 . engravers of small seals require a good light. 1464 . tytan , titan, frequently used as synonymous with the sun; as in ovid, met. i. 10. chaucer has confused him with tithonus , the husband of aurora, whom he denotes by dawing in l. 1466, and by morwe in l. 1469. 'iamque, fugatura tithoni coniuge noctem, praeuius aurorae lucifer ortus erat.' ovid, heroid. xviii. 111. 1490 . read wer-e , in two syllables. these worldes tweyne seems to mean 'two worlds such as this.' 1495 . this somewhat resembles verg. ecl. i. 60-4. 1502 . 'even if i had to die by torture;' as in bk. i. 674. 1514 . mo , others; see note to cler. ta. e 1039. 1546 . 'desire burnt him afresh, and pleasure began to arise more than at first.' cf. the parallel line in leg. good wom. 1156: 'of which ther gan to breden swich a fyr.' yet bell rejects this reading as being 'not at all in chaucer's manner,' and prefers nonsense. 1577 . 'christ forgave those who crucified him.' 1600 . cf. æneid. vi. 550 :— 'quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis tartareus phlegethon.' 1625 . from boethius, lib. ii. pr. 4: 'sed hoc est, quod recolentem uehementius coquit. nam in omni aduersitate fortunae infelicissimum genus est infortunii, fuisse felicem.' cf. dante, inf. v. 121; tennyson, locksley hall—'that a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.' {483} 1634 . cf. rom. de la rose, 8301-4; from ovid, art. amat. ii. 13. 1642 . ne i , read n'i . rakle , behave rashly; it is plainly a verb , formed from the adj. rakel . morris inserts ben after rakel , to the ruin of the scansion. cf. norweg. rakla , to ramble, totter, be unsteady (aasen); swed. dial. rakkla , to rove (rietz); icel. reka , to drive. 1649 . i shal , i owe; a. s. ic sceal . 1687 . comprende , comprehend; f. comprendre . this is clearly the right form. in the sq. ta. f 223, though the mss. have comprehende , it is obvious that comprende is the real reading. 1703 . pirous , i. e. pyroeis, one of the four horses that drew the chariot of the sun. the other three were eöus, æthon, and phlegon; see ovid, met. ii. 153. 1705 . 'have taken some short cut, to spite me.' 1732 . 'to the extent of a single knot.' it would not be necessary to explain this, if it were not for bell's explanation of knot as 'gnat.' 1734 . y-masked , enmeshed; cf. a. s. masc , a mesh. 1744-68 . paraphrased from boethius, lib. ii. met. 8; but note that the lines italicised are transposed, and represent ll. 1744-1750: 'quòd mundus stabili fide concordes uariat uices, quòd pugnantia semina foedus perpetuum tenent, quòd phoebus roseum diem curru prouehit aureo, ut quas duxerit hesperus phoebe noctibus imperet, ut fluctus auidum mare certo fine coërceat, ne terris liceat uagis latos tendere terminos. hanc rerum seriem ligat, terras ac pelagus regens, et caelo imperitans amor. hic si fraena remiserit, quidquid nunc amat inuicem, bellum continuò geret: et quam nunc socia fide pulcris motibus incitant, certent soluere machinam. hic sancto populos quoque iunctos foedere continet: hic et coniugii sacrum castis nectit amoribus: hic fidis etiam sua dictat iura sodalibus. o felix hominum genus, si uestros animos amor quo caelum regitur, regat!' 1764 . halt to-hepe , holds together, preserves in concord. bell and morris have the corrupt reading to kepe . to hepe , to a heap, became the adv. to-hepe , together. it occurs again in ch. astrolabe, part i. § 14, and in boethius, bk. iv. pr. 6. 182. cf.

'that love, by means of his power, would be pleased,' &c. 1779 . in tyme of trewe , in time of truce; as in boccaccio, fil. iii. st. 91. bell wrongly has out of troy . morris alters trewe to trewes ; but see bk. iv. l. 1312. 1805 . these are four of the seven deadly sins; see pers. tale. 1807 . lady , i. e. venus, called dionaea as being daughter of dione; æneid. iii. 19. cf. homer, il. v. 370. {484} 1809 . the nine muses. helicon was a long way from mount parnassus; but see notes to anelida, 15, and ho. fame, 521. 1817 . 'as it pleases my author to relate.' book iv. the following scheme gives some notion of the relationship of the contents of this book to the filostrato, but chaucer constantly expands and adds to the original, and not unfrequently transposes the order of the text. troilus: book iv. filostrato. 1-10. bk. iii. st. 94. 29-35. bk. iv. st. 1. 47-110.

(it will be best for you) to despoil this town. 86 . resport , regard. this strange word is certified by its reappearance in l. 850, where it rimes to discomfórt . it is given in roquefort, but only in a technical sense. it was, doubtless, formed from o. f. esport , deportment, demeanour, regard (godefroy), by prefixing re- ; and means 'demeanour towards,' or (here) simply 'regard,' as also in {486} l. 850. the etymology is from lat. re- , ex , and portare . cf. f. rapport , from re- , ad , and portare . 96 . in hir sherte , in her smock only; i.e. without much rich clothing; 'as she was.' 99 . 'for because i saw no opportunity.' 112 . as yerne , as briskly as possible, very soon; so in l. 201. 120-4 . laomedon, father of priam, founded troy. apollo and poseidon (neptune) had been condemned for a while to serve him for wages. but laomedon refused them payment, and incurred their displeasure. 133 . antenor had been taken prisoner by the greeks; see lydgate, siege of troye, bk. iii. ch. 24. lydgate's version is that antenor was to be exchanged for thoas, king of calydon; and, at the request of chalcas, it was arranged that antenor should be exchanged for both thoas and criseyde (see l. 138); to which priam consented. withoute more , without further ado; cf. l. 376. 143 . parlement ; here boccaccio has parlamento , i.e. a parley. chaucer gives it the english sense. 168 . 'the love of you both, where it was before unknown.' 197 . from juvenal, sat. x. ll. 2-4 :— 'pauci dignoscere possunt vera bona atque illis multum diuersa, remota erroris nebula.' cf. dryden's translation and dr. johnson's poem on the vanity of human wishes. 198, 9 . what is to yerne , what is desirable. offence , disappointment. 203 . mischaunce ; because antenor contrived the removal from troy of the palladium, on which the safety of the city depended. cf. lydgate, siege of troye, bk. iv. ch. 34; or the account by caxton, quoted in specimens of english from 1394-1579, ed. skeat, p. 89. 210 . here and howne. the sense of this phrase is not known; but, judging by the context, it seems to mean—'thus said every one, such was the common rumour.' it has been explained as 'thus said hare and hound ,' i.e. people of all sorts; but the m. e. form of hare is hare (a. s. hara ), and the m. e. form of 'hound' never appears as howne , which, by the way, is evidently dissyllabic. in the absence of further evidence, guesswork is hardly profitable; but i should like to suggest that the phrase may mean 'gentle and savage.' the m. e. here , gentle, occurs in layamon, 25867; and in amis and amiloun, 16 (stratmann); from a. s. hēore . houne answers, phonetically, to an a. s. hūna , which may mean a hun, a savage; cf. ger. hüne . 225 . from dante, inf. iii. 112 :— 'come d'autunno si levan le foglie l'una appresso dell' altra infin che 'l ramo rende alla terra tutte le sue spoglie.' {487} 239 . this stanza follows boccaccio closely; but boccaccio, in his turn, here imitates a passage in dante, inf. xii. 22 :— 'qual è quel toro che si slaccia in quella c'ha ricevuto già 'l colpo mortale, che gir non sa, ma qua e là saltella.' 251, 2 . almost repeated in the clerk ta. e 902, 3; see note to the latter line, and cf. gower, conf. amant. ii. 14—'right as a lives creature she semeth,' &c. 263 . in ms. h., thus is glossed by 'sine causa.' 272 . accent misérie on e ; 'nella miseria;' inf. v. 123. 279 . combre-world , encumbrance of the world, a compound epithet. it is used by hoccleve, in his lament for chaucer, de regim. principum, st. 299. 'a cumber-world , yet in the world am left;' drayton, pastorals, ecl. ii. 25. 286 . gerful , changeable; see note to kn. ta. a 1536. 300 . edippe , œdipus, king of thebes, who put out his own eyes on finding that he had slain his father laius and married his mother jocasta; statius, theb. i. 46. 302 . rossetti thus translates fil. iv. st. 34: 'o soul, wretched and astray, why fliest thou not out of the most ill-fortuned body that lives? o soul brought low, part from the body, and follow chryseis.' 305 . unneste , glossed in h. by 'go out of thi nest;' correctly. 318 . read my , not the or thy ; rossetti thus translates fil. iv. st. 36: 'o my chryseis, o sweet bliss of the sorrowing soul which calls on thee! who will any more give comfort to my pains?' 330 . unholsom ; boccaccio has insano , fil. iv. st. 38. 'i think it pretty clear that b. means insane in our ordinary sense for that word; but chaucer's unholsom is no doubt founded on b.'s epithet, and is highly picturesque.'—rossetti. 356, 7 . nearly repeated in man of lawes ta. b 608, 9. see l. 882. 381 . 'as certainly do i wish it were false, as i know it is true.' 392 . propretee , his own indefeasible possession; see boethius, bk. ii. pr. 2. 9 (p. 27), 61 (p. 28). 407 . pandarus took his morality from ovid; cf. amorum lib. ii. 4. 10-44: 'centum sunt causae, cur ego semper amem;' &c. 413 . heroner , a large falcon for herons; faucon for rivere , a goshawk for waterfowl. see note to sir thopas, b 1927. 414, 5 . from boccaccio, who does not, however, give the name of the author of the saying. the remark 'as zanzis writeth' is chaucer's own. it is quite clear that zanzis in this passage is the same as the zanzis in the physiciens tale, c 16; and he is no other than zeuxis the painter. i do not suppose that chaucer had any special reason for assigning to him the saying, but his name was as useful as that of any one else, and the medieval method of reference is frequently so casual and light-hearted that there is nothing to wonder at. besides, we are distinctly told (l. 428) that pandarus was speaking for the nonce , {488} i.e. quite at random. the real author is ovid: 'successore nouo uincitur omnis amor;' remed. amor. 462. 460 . pleyen raket , play at rackets, knocking the ball forwards and backwards; alluding to the rebound of the ball after striking the wall. 461 . netle in, dokke out means, as chaucer says, first one thing and then another. the words are taken from a charm for curing the sting of a nettle, repeated whilst the patient rubs in the juice from a dock-leaf. the usual formula is simply, 'in dock, out nettle,' for which see brockett's glossary of north-country words, s. v. dockon (dock); but chaucer is doubtless correct. he refers to a fuller form of words, given in notes and queries, 1st ser. iii. 368 :— 'nettle in, dock out—dock in, nettle out; nettle in, dock out—dock rub nettle out.' akermann's glossary of wiltshire words gives a third formula, as follows :— 'out 'ettle, in dock—dock shall ha' a new smock; 'ettle zhan't ha' narrun.' i.e. nettle shan't have ne'er one. see also n. and q. 1st ser. iii. 205, 368; xi. 92; athenæum, sept. 12, 1846; brand, pop. antiq. iii. 315. in the testament of love, bk. i., the present passage is quoted in the following form: 'ye wete wel, lady, eke (quod i) that i haue not playde racket, nettyl in, docke out , and with the wethercocke waued;' ed. 1550, fol. cccv. col. 2. this shews that the text is correct. 462 . 'now ill luck befall her, that may care for thy wo.' 481-3 . gabbestow , liest thou. ll. 482, 3 are a reproduction of pandarus' own saying, in bk. iii. 1625-8. 493 . deficient in the first foot; read—'i | that liv'd' | &c. 497 . formely ; cm. formaly ; for formelly , i.e. formally. 503 . from boethius, bk. i. met. 1. 13, 14 (p. 1). 506 . troilus speaks as if dead already. 'well wot i, whilst i lived in peace, before thou (death) didst slay me, i would have given (thee) hire;' i.e. a bribe, not to attack me. 520 . alambyk , alembic; i.e. a retort, or vessel used in distilling; in cant. ta. g 794, ms. e. has the pl. alambikes , and most other mss. have alembikes . the word was afterwards split up into a lembick or a limbeck ; see macb. i. 7. 67. chaucer took this from le rom. de la rose, 6406-7 :— 'je vois maintes fois que tu plores cum alambic sus alutel.' 556 . 'then think i, this would injure her reputation.' 583 . 'but if i had so ardent a love, and had thy rank.' 588 . cf. the phrase 'a nine days' wonder.' lat. nouendiale sacrum ; livy, i. 31. 600 . 'audentes fortuna iuuat;' æneid. x. 284; 'fortes fortuna adiuuat'; terence, phormio, i. 4. 26. 602 . 'unhardy is unsely;' reves ta. a 4210. {489} 603 . for litel , ms. h. and thynne have lite . it makes no difference, either to the sense or the scansion. 607 . for ferd , for fear (h2. for drede ; thynne, for feare ). properly for ferde , as in ho. fame, 950; but often shortened to for ferd . ferde or ferd is tolerably common as a sb., but some scribes hardly understood it. hence mss. cl. and h. have of-fered , i.e. greatly frightened. 618 . cf. kn. ta. a 1163-8; and the notes. 622 . 'boldly stake the world on casts of the dice.' cf. cant. tales, b 125, c 653, and the notes. 627 . nearly repeated in kn. tale, a 1010. 630 . 'the devil help him that cares about it.' 659-61 . from boccaccio, fil. iv. st. 78; cf. æneid. iv. 188. 683 . 'and expected to please her.' for pitous ioye represents 'pietosa allegrezza,' fil. iv. st. 80. 684 . 'dear enough at a mite;' cf. note to l. g. wom. 741. 692 . on every syde ; 'd'ogni partito;' fil. iv. 81. i suppose it means, literally, 'on every side;' troy being subject to attacks at various points. 708-14 . certainly genuine; found also in fil. iv. 84. 716 . deficient in the first foot. 735 . dr. furnivall says that mss. cl., h., and others have here misplaced a stanza, meaning that ll. 750-6 should have come next, as shewn by boccaccio's text. but only ms. cm. has such an order, and it is quite certain that the other mss. are right. the order in boccaccio's text furnishes no real guide, as chaucer often transposes such order; and it is odd that only this one instance should have been noted. it is better to consider the order in ms. cm. as wrong, and to say that it transposes the text by placing ll. 750-6 after l. 735, and gives a somewhat different version of ll. 750-2. 736 . ounded , waved, wavy; see ho. fame, 1386, and note. cf. 'tear my bright hair,' &c.; shak. troilus, iv. 2. 112. 750 . cf. note to l. 735. ms. cm., which inserts this stanza after l. 735, begins thus :— 'the salte teris from hyre eyȝyn tweyn out ran, as schour of aprille ful swythe; hyre white brest sche bet, and for the peyne,' &c. 762 . this line, giving the name of criseyde's mother, is not in boccaccio (fil. iv. stt. 89-93). i do not know where chaucer found the form argyve ; in statius, theb. ii. 297, argia is the name of the wife of polynices, and ch. calls her argyve ; see bk. v. l. 1509 below. 769, 70 . by-word , proverb: 'plants without a root soon die.' 782 . ordre , order. she will pass her life in mourning and abstinence, as if she had entered a religious order. 790 . elysos , elysium. it looks as if chaucer was thinking of vergil's 'elysios ... campos;' georg. i. 38; for the story of orpheus and eurydice occurs in georg. iv. 453-527. cf. ovid, met. x. 1-85. {490} 829 . cause causinge , the primary cause. ' causa causans , a primary or original cause; causa causata , a secondary or intermediate cause;' new e. dict., s. v. causa . 831 . wher , short for whether ; as in cant. ta. b 3119, &c. 836 . 'extrema gaudii luctus occupat;' prov. xiv. 13. see note to man of lawes ta. b 421. 842 . the first foot is deficient: 'peyn | e tor | ment,' &c. 843 . 'there is no misery that is not within my body.' 850 . resport , regard; see note to l. 86 above. 865 . compare the similar lines in kn. ta. a 1400, 1. 866 . men , weakened form of man , takes a sing. verb. 870 . bi-trent , winds round; see note to iii. 1231. 884 . into litel , within a little, very nearly. 887 . fawe , gladly; cf. cant. ta. d 220. 907 . bane , destruction; see kn. ta. a 1097, 1681. 927 . 'be to him rather a cause of the flat than of the edge ,' i.e. of healing rather than of harming. a curious allusion which is fully explained by reference to the squieres tale, f 156-165. see also note to the same, f 238. 947-1085 . this passage is not in boccaccio, but some of it is in boethius; see below. 963-1078 . a considerable portion of this passage is copied, more or less closely, from boethius, lib. v. pr. 2 and pr. 3. the correspondences are all pointed out below. chaucer's own prose translation should be compared. for example, the word wrythen (l. 986) appears in that also (bk. v. pr. 3. 15). 963-6 . 'quae tamen ille, ab aeterno cuncta prospiciens, prouidentiae cernit intuitus, et suis quaeque meritis praedestinata disponit;' boeth. v. pr. 2 (end). 968 . grete clerkes ; such as boethius, saint augustine, and bishop bradwardine; see non. pr. ta. b 4431, 2. 974-80 . 'nam si cuncta prospicit deus, neque falli ullo modo potest, euenire necesse est, quod prouidentia futurum esse praeuiderit. quare si ab aeterno non facta hominum modo, sed etiam consilia uoluntatesque praenoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas;' boeth. v. pr. 3. 981-7 ( continued ): 'neque enim uel factum aliud ullum, uel quaelibet existere poterit uoluntas, nisi quam nescia falli prouidentia diuina praesenserit. nam si res aliorsum, quam prouisae sunt, detorqueri ualent, non iam erit futuri firma praescientia.' 988-994 ( continued ): 'sed opinio potius incerta: quod de deo credere nefas iudico.' 996 . i.e. who have received the tonsure. 997-1001 . 'aiunt enim, non ideo quid esse euenturum, quoniam id prouidentia futurum esse prospexerit: sed è contrario potius, quoniam quid futurum est, id diuinam prouidentiam latere non posse;' boeth. v. pr. 3. 1002-1008 ( continued ): 'eoque modo necessarium hoc in contrariam relabi partem. neque enim necesse est contingere, quae prouidentur; sed necesse esse, quae futura sunt, prouideri.' 1009-1015 {491} ( continued ): 'quasi uero, quae cuiusque rei caussa sit, praescientiane futurorum necessitatis, an futurorum necessitas prouidentiae, laboretur.' 1016-1022 ( continued ): 'at nos illud demonstrare nitamur, quoquo modo sese habeat ordo caussarum, necessarium esse euentum praescitarum rerum, etiam si praescientia futuris rebus eueniendi necessitatem non uideatur inferre.' (the negative in l. 1016 is remarkable, but chaucer's prose rendering presents the same form. surely he has taken nitamur as if it were uitamus .) 1023-9 . ( continued ): 'etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quae eum sedere coniectat ueram esse necesse est: atque è conuerso rursus, (1030-6) si de quopiam uera sit opinio, quoniam sedet, eum sedere necesse est. in utroque igitur necessitas inest: in hoc quidem sedendi, at uerò in altero ueritatis.' 1037-1047 ( continued ): 'sed non idcirco quisque sedet, quoniam uera est opinio; sed haec potius uera est, quoniam quempiam sedere praecessit. ita cùm caussa ueritatis ex altera parte procedat, inest tamen communis in utraque necessitas. similia de prouidentia futurisque rebus ratiocinari patet.' 1051-78 ( continued ): 'nam etiam si idcirco, quoniam futura sunt, prouidentur; non uero ideo, quoniam prouidentur eueniunt: nihilo minus tamen à deo uel uentura prouideri, uel prouisa euenire necesse est: quod ad perimendam arbitrii libertatem solùm satis est. iam uero quam praeposterum est, ut aeternae praescientiae temporalium rerum euentus caussa esse dicatur? quid est autem aliud arbitrari, ideo deum futura, quoniam sunt euentura, prouidere, quam putare quae olim acciderunt, caussam summae illius esse prouidentiae? ad haec, sicuti cum quid esse scio, id ipsum esse necesse est: ita cum quid futurum noui, id ipsum futurum necesse est. sic fit igitur, ut euentus praescitae rei nequeat euitari.' 1094 . ferd , fared; not the pp. of faren (l. 1087), but of the weak verb feren (a. s. fēran ). the correct pp. of faren is faren . see stratmann. 1105 . 'a man may offer his neck soon enough when it (i. e. his head) must come off.' 1136 . 'beyond the nature of tears.' 1139 . myrrha, daughter of cinyras, king of cyprus, who was changed into a myrrh-tree; ovid, met. x. 298. the tree wept tears of myrrh; id. x. 500. 1146 . hir-e (ms. cl. here ), their, is here dissyllabic. unswelle , cease to swell, as in bk. v. 214. 1147 . 'all hoarse, and exhausted with shrieking.' forshright is the pp. of forshriken , to shriek excessively. bell wrongly has for shright ; but shright is not a noun. the ital. has 'con rotta voce,' with broken voice; fil. iv. st. 116. 1153 . 'being always on the point of departing.' 1162 . 'whether it was sad for him.' 1174 . cf. 'and bisily gan,' &c.; prol. a 301. {492} 1179 . preignant (f. preignant , pregnant , cotgrave), catching hold of tightly, hence, forcible; pres. part. of prendre , to seize. quite distinct from pregnant when representing lat. praegnans . 1181 . woon , hope, resource. this answers to early e. wān (see stratmann), and is allied to icel. ván , hope, expectation; cf. icel. væna , to hope for, to ween. the word is monosyllabic, and the long o is 'open,' as shewn by its riming with noon , goon , from a. s. nān , gān . bell quite fails to explain it, and morris suggests 'remedy,' without assigning any reason. it is common in rob. of gloucester, with similar rimes, and does not mean 'custom' or 'habit' or 'manner,' as suggested in mr. wright's glossary, nor has it any connection with m. e. wone , custom, which was dissyllabic, and had a short vowel in the former syllable; but it means, as here, 'hope' or 'resource.' for example: 'tho he ne sey other won ' = when he saw nothing else to be done; rob. glouc. ed. hearne, p. 12; ed. wright, l. 275. 'and flowe in-to hor castles, vor hii nadde other won ,' i. e. no other resource; id. p. 19, ed. hearne, l. 442. this is one of the rather numerous words in chaucer that have not been rightly understood. 1185 . twighte , plucked; pt. t. of twicchen . 1188 . 'where the doom of minos would assign it a place.' boccaccio here uses the word inferno (fil. iv. 120) to denote the place where troilus' soul would dwell; which rossetti explains to mean simply hades. chaucer's meaning is the same; he is referring to æneid. vi. 431-3. 1208 . atropos is the fate who cuts the thread of life; see note to v. 7. 1237 . a forlong wey , two minutes and a half, to speak exactly; see note to c. t., a 3637. 1241 . either slayn is here expanded into slayen , or the pause after this word does duty for a syllable, in the scansion. 1242 . ho , stop, cease; see kn. ta. a 1706. 1244 . ther-e is here made into a dissyllable. 1245 . morter , mortar. the century dict. quotes from dugdale's hist. of st. paul's (ed. ellis), p. 27: 'a mortar was a wide bowl of iron or metal; it rested upon a stand or branch, and was filled either with fine oil or wax, which was kept burning by means of a broad wick [at funerals or on tombs].' it was named from its similarity in shape to the mortar in which things were pounded. i remember the word in common use; it came to denote what is now called a night-light , and the word night-light seems to have nearly displaced it. in this modern contrivance, the old 'mortar' is sometimes represented by a paper casing. the term was frequently applied, not merely to the saucer which held the grease, but to the light itself, which sometimes took the shape of a short candle. cotgrave explains f. mortier as 'a kind of small chamber-lamp.' instead of morter , ms. cm. has percher , which meant a kind of wax candle placed upon a branch or bar called a perche (perch). 1295 . 'about that (there) is no question.' cf. l. 1694. {493} 1374 . wether , sheep. i. e. it is advisable to give the wolf a limb of a sheep, in order to save the rest. 1377 . grave , incise, make an impression upon. 1380 . moble (h., h2. moeble ), movable property; cf. f. meubles . 1404 . 'whilst he is making his divination; and i will make him believe.' ll. 1401-14 are due to a passage in guido; see allit. destruction of troy, 8101-40. 1406 . amphibologyes , ambiguities. a more correct form is amphiboly , from gk. ἀμφιβολία ; see new e. dict. the ambiguous character of the old oracular responses is well known. 1411 . 'when he started away from delphi for fear.' cf. l. 607. 1422 . see note to book i. 463. 1425 . the selve wit , the same opinion. 1435 . clere , clear of woe, free, light. ms. h. has chere . 1453 . 'the bear has one opinion, and his leader another.' 1456 . repeated in kn. ta. a 2449; see note. 1459 . 'with eyes like argus;' i. e. seeing everywhere. argus had a hundred eyes; ovid, met. i. 625. 1483 . fere , frighten, terrify; as in bk. ii. 124. 1505 . 'to lose the substance, for the sake of something accidentally representing it;' as when the dog dropped the piece of meat, in his anxiety to get the shadow (or reflected image) of it. as to the famous words substance and accident , see note to pard. ta. c 539. 1525 . go we , let us go; also written gowe , p. plowm. b. pr. 226. 1538-40 . juno caused athamas, the husband of ino, to run mad. as ovid tells the story, juno descended into hell, and crossed the styx, in order to persuade the fury tisiphone to haunt athamas. hence the mention of the styx was readily suggested. see ovid, met. iv. 416-561, esp. l. 434. styx was not, as chaucer says, 'the pit of hell,' but a river that flowed through it. 1544 . satiry and fauny , satyri and fauni, satyrs and fauns. chaucer was probably thinking of ovid, met. vi. 392-4, where the fauni , satyri , and nymphae are described as 'ruricolae, siluarum numina.' for halve goddes , we now say demigods . 1548 . simois , a river of troas; æneid. i. 100. 1560 . laye , would lie; subj. the e is elided. 1562 . take , take place, be made. thynne has be take , but be clogs the line, and is not in the mss. 1584 . 'vincit qui patitur;' see frank. ta. f 773. 1585 . 'he who will have what he wants must give up what he likes.' such seems to be the sense intended. leef means 'dear.' one of heywood's proverbs is—'nought lay down, nought take up;' and very similar to this is—'nothing venture, nothing have.' for the second leef , ms. h. has lyfe , a reading adopted by bell and morris. this takes all point out of the saying, and does not seem applicable to the case. ll. 1587 and 1588 repeat the saying in another form, and confirm the reading in the text. cf. boeth. bk. ii. pr. 4. 98. {494} 1591, 2 . lucina , i. e. diana, or the moon; cf. kn. ta. a 2085. 'before the moon pass out of the sign of aries beyond that of leo.' in order to this, the moon would have to pass wholly through taurus, gemini, cancer, and leo, thus traversing a distance represented by about 4 signs, or a third part of the whole zodiac: this would take up about the third part of 28 days, or more than 9 days. this brings us, as criseyde says, to the 10th day (l. 1595). such a method of counting is natural enough to those that watch the moon's course; and lovers are generally credited with taking a special interest in that luminary; cf. l. 1608. in the sequel, a good deal turns upon this 'tenth day.' cf. ll. 1320, 1328, 1685; v. 239, 642, 681, 1103, 1206. 1608 . cynthia , i. e. diana, the moon; ovid, met. ii. 465. 1612 . 'to lose one opportunity, in order to gain another.' 1620 . pure , very; as in kn. ta. a 1279. 1628 . 'who can hold a thing that tries to get away?' 'an eel and woman, a learned poet says, unless by th' tail and with thy teeth thou hold, will either fail.' the two noble kinsmen, a. iii. sc. 5. l. 49. 1645 . 'res est solliciti plena timoris amor;' ovid, her. i. 12. 1667-73 . in boccaccio, a stanza of a similar character is assigned to troilus, not to criseyde. 1677 . poeplish ; boccaccio (fil. iv. st. 165) has popolesco , which rossetti translates by 'low-bred.' florio's ital. dict. has: ' popolesco , popular, of the common people.' 1682 . fórtun-è is trisyllabic. book v. the following sketch gives a general notion of the relation of this book to the filostrato, though chaucer often amplifies and transposes the material in a way that it would be tedious to particularise more minutely. troilus: book v. filostrato. ll. 1-7.

'upon the report of such behaviour of his.' 65 . so in boccaccio: 'con un falcone in pugno;' fil. v. st. 10. 67 . a mistranslation. boccaccio's word is not valle , a valley, but vallo , a rampart. the first foot lacks a syllable. 71 . antenor was the trojan, captured by the greeks, who was restored to troy in exchange for thoas and criseyde. 88 . sone of tydeus , i. e. diomede, often called tydides ; as in æneid. i. 97, 471, &c. 89 . to know one's creed is very elementary knowledge. 90 . by the reyne hir hente ; rossetti thinks chaucer misunderstood {496} di colei si piglia (fil. v. 13), which might mean 'takes hold of her,' but really means 'takes a fancy to her.' 98 . this resembles 'to take care of no. 1.' 101 . make it tough , raise a difficulty, viz. by disparaging troilus. 106 . coude his good , knew what was good for him, knew what he was about. bell says—'understood good manners.' 128 . helply ; we now say 'helpful,' i.e. serviceable. to my might , to the best of my power. 143 . o god of love , one and the same god of love. 151 . this , contracted form of this is . enseled , sealed up. 158 . as paramours , as by way of love. cf. l. 332. 180 . see below (l. 530), and man of lawes ta. b 697. we can read either brast (burst), or braste (would burst). 182 . sye , to sink down; a. s. sīgan ; see siȝen in stratmann. 194 . mewet , mute; as in the court of love, 148. mewet , muwet , or muet is from the o. f. muët , orig. dissyllabic, and answering to a low lat. diminutive type *mutettum . the e. word is now obsolete, being displaced by the simple form mute , borrowed directly from lat. mutus , which in o. f. became mu . mute is common in shakespeare. lydgate has: 'and also clos and muët as a stone;' siege of thebes, pt. iii. § 8. in merlin, ed. wheatley, p. 172, we find 'stille and mewet as though thei hadde be dombe.' the -e in mild-e is not elided; the a. s. milde is dissyllabic. 208 . cipryde , i.e. cypris, or venus; see note to parl. foules, 277. 212 . the -ie in furie is rapidly slurred over. ixion is accented on the first syllable. ixion was bound, in hell, to an ever-revolving wheel; georg. iii. 38; æn. vi. 601. 249 . as mete , as (for instance) dream; see l. 251. 283 . 'although he had sworn (to do so) on forfeit of his head.' 304 . pálestrál , i.e. games consisting of wrestling-matches and similar contests; from lat. palaestra ; see verg. æn. iii. 280, 281; and g. douglas, ed. small, vol. iii. p. 52, l. 24. there is a description of such games, held at a funeral, in statius, theb. vi., which is imitated by chaucer in the knightes tale; see note to a 2863. vigile (l. 305) is the same as chaucer's liche-wake ; see note to a 2958. 306 . he means that his steed, sword, and helm are to be offered up to mars, and his shield to pallas, at his funeral; cf. kn. ta. a 2889-2894. 319 . ascaphilo , a transposed form of ascalaphus, whom proserpine changed into an owl; ovid, met. v. 539. so also adriane for ariadne. bell's note, that the form of ascaphilo is italian, and helps to prove that chaucer here follows boccaccio is misleading; for boccaccio does not mention ascalaphus. 321 . mercury was supposed to convey men's souls to hades. see l. 1827 below, and note. 332 . paramours , passionately; an adverb, as usual; cf. l. 158. 345 . by freendes might , by constraint of their relatives. {497} 350 . hurt , for hurteth , hurts; present tense. 360 . on dreams, cf. non. pr. ta. b 4113-4129, 4280-4. 365-8 . from le rom. de la rose, 18709-12, q. v. 379 . lit. 'well is it, concerning dreams, to these old wives;' i.e. these old women set a value on dreams. 387 . boccaccio has: 'a te stesso perdona,' i.e. spare thyself; chaucer takes it literally—'forgive thyself.' 403 . sarpedon had been taken prisoner by the greeks (iv. 52). neither boccaccio nor chaucer explains how he had got back to troy. see l. 431. 409 . iouken , slumber; cf. p. plowman, c. xix. 126. it was chiefly used as a term in falconry, and applied to hawks. in the boke of st. albans, fol. a 6, we are told that it is proper to say that 'your hauke ioukith , and not slepith.' from o. f. joquier , jouquier ; see godefroy. 421 . of fyne force , by very necessity. 451 . i read 'piëtous,' as in ms. h., not 'pitous,' for the sake of the metre, as in bk. iii. 1444; cf. pietee , id. 1033. perhaps chaucer was thinking of the ital. pietoso . we also find the spelling pitevous , for which form there is sufficient authority; see wyclif, 2 tim. iii. 12, titus ii. 12; rob. of glouc. ed. wright, 5884 (footnote); cf. mod. e. piteous . chaucer's usual word is pitous , as in cant. ta. b 449, 1059, c 298, &c. 460 . for , because; as frequently. 469 . 'fortune intended to glaze his hood still better.' to 'glaze one's hood' was to furnish a man with a glass hood, a jocular phrase for to mock or expose to attack; because a glass hood would be no defence at all. chaucer himself admirably illustrates this saying in a passage which has already occurred above; see bk. ii. 867. 478 . her-e is dissyllabic; as in ho. fame, 980, 1014, 1885, 1912, &c. 479 . congeyen us , bid us take leave, dismiss us. 484 . 'did we come here to fetch light for a fire, and run home again?' a man who borrows a light must hurry back before it goes out. 505 . hasel-wode , hazel-wood; an allusion to a popular saying, expressive of incredulity. see note to l. 1174 below. not the same proverb as that in bk. iii. 890. 541 . 'o house, formerly called the best of houses.' bell and morris place the comma after houses . 552 . as to kissing the door, see note to rom. rose, 2676. 601 . referring, probably, to statius, theb. i. 12—'quod saeuae iunonis opus.' but this refers to the wrath of juno against athamas rather than against thebes. 642 . 'wherefore, if, on the tenth night, i fail (to have) the guiding of thy bright beams for a single hour,' &c. 655 . here thynne's reading, lucina , is obviously correct; see bk. iv. 1591. by the common mistake of writing t for c , it became lutina, and was then changed into latona . but latona was lucina's mother . 664 . pheton , phaethon; alluding to ovid, met. ii. 34, 47, &c. {498} 744 . prudence is here represented with three eyes, to behold present, past, and future; but creseyde had but two eyes, and failed to see what was to come. cf. 'rerum fato prudentia maior;' georg. i. 416. 763 .

'nothing venture, nothing have.' 805 . in lydgate's siege of troye, we are told that diomede brought 80 ships with him 'fro calidonye and arge;' bk. ii. ch. 16, in the catalogue of the ships. the english alliterative romance omits this passage. arge is the town of argos, ruled over by diomede; homer, il. ii. 559. calidoine is calydon, in ætolia, of which city tydeus, father of diomede, was king; see l. 934, and ll. 1513-5 below. 806 . this description seems to be mainly chaucer's own. it occurs again, much amplified, in lydgate's siege of troy, bk. ii. ch. 15, where it precedes the description of priam. boccaccio says that she had 'lucent eyes and an angelic face' (fil. i. st. 28), with which cf. l. 816. he also describes her as 'accorta, savia, onesta, e costumata,' which rossetti translates by 'discerning, wise, honourable, and high-bred' (fil. i. 11); cf. ll. 820, 821. 827 . troilus is described by guido delle colonne; see the translations, in the alliterative destruction of troy, ed. panton and donaldson, l. 3922, and in lydgate's siege of troye, bk. ii. ch. 16. 836 . troilus was second to hector in prowess (bk. ii. 158, 644), but not in courage (bk. i. 474). 837 . durring don , daring to do, courage; where durring is a sb. formed from durren , to dare. so in l. 840, to durre don is 'to dare to do.' it is quite a mistake to regard durring don as a compound word, as is usually done by such as are ignorant of middle english grammar. spenser borrowed the phrase, but may have misunderstood it. in the globe edition of spenser, derring-doe occurs with a hyphen , in shep. kal. oct. l. 65, but as two words , in f. q. ii. 4. 42, vi. 5. 37. in f. q. ii. 7. 10, we find 'in der-doing armes,' which i leave to be explained by the omniscient critic. 852 . see the parallel line, squi. ta. f 294; cf. bk. iii. 674. 883 . as who seyth , so to speak. 892 . manes , the departed spirits or shades of the dead. he means that even these will dread the greeks. the idea that they are the 'gods of pain' is taken from vergil, æn. vi. 743; cf. statius, theb. viii. 84. boccaccio merely has 'tra' morti in inferno'; fil. vi. st. 16. 897 . ambages , ambiguities; adapted from boccaccio's 'ambage' (fil. vi. st. 17), which ch. has to explain. 911-938 . these lines are fairly close to the original. 934 . see note above, to l. 805. b. has: 'di calidonia e d' argo;' fil. vi. st. 24. 937 . tydeus, father of diomede, is one of the chief heroes in the thebaid of statius, which describes the struggle between eteocles and {499} polynices (called polymites in l. 938) for the possession of thebes. tydeus and polynices married sisters, the daughters of adrastus, king of argos; hence their alliance. for the death of tydeus in battle, see the conclusion of book viii of the thebaid. see ll. 1480-1501 below. 971 . orcades , the orkney islands, very remote from rome; juvenal, sat. ii. 161. inde , india, remote from rome in the other direction; vergil, æn. vi. 794. here the point of view is transferred from rome to troy. 975 . she was a widow; bk. i. 97. in l. 977, she lies boldly. 992 . 'when i see what i have never seen yet (viz. troy taken), perhaps i will do what i have never yet done (i. e. think of a second husband).' 1013 . this incident is not in boccaccio; but it occurs in guido delle colonne, which chaucer must therefore have consulted. the alliterative destruction of troy duly records the circumstance, ll. 8092-4 :— 'a gloue of that gay gate he belyue, drogh hit full dernly the damsell fro; none seond but hir-selfe, that suffert full well.' 1016 . i. e. venus was seen as 'the evening-star.' 1018, 9 . cynthea , i. e. the moon; bk. iv. 1608. in bk. iv. l. 1591, criseyde had promised to return before the moon passed out of the sign leo. this was now on the point of happening; the moon was leaving leo, to pass into virgo. 1020 . signifer , the 'sign-bearer,' the zodiac. 'this forseide hevenish zodiak is cleped the cercle of the signes;' astrolabe, pt. i. § 21. the zodiac extended, north and south, to the breadth of 6 degrees on both sides of the ecliptic line, thus forming a belt 12 degrees wide. this included numerous bright stars, such as regulus ( α leonis) and spica virginis ( α virginis), here called 'candles.' chaucer may have found the word signifer in claudian, in rufinum, i. 365. 1039 . he wan , he took in battle. thynne reads she ; but he is right. diomede got possession of troilus' horse, and sent it to criseyde; whereupon she said that diomede might keep it for himself. note that chaucer refers us to 'the story' for this incident; by which he means the historia troiana of guido. but guido only goes as far as to say that diomed sent troilus' horse to criseyde; the rest is chaucer's addition. see the allit. destruction of troy, ll. 8296-8317; and lydgate's siege of troye, bk. iii. ch. 26, ed. 1557, fol. r 4, back. cf. shak. troilus, v. 5. 1: ' dio. go, go, my servant, take thou troilus' horse, present the fair steed to my lady cressid.' the incidents of the 'broche' and 'pensel' are chaucer's own; see bk. iii. 1370-2. 1043 . pencel , short for penoncel , a little pennon or banner; here it means that diomede wore a sleeve of hers as a streamer on his helmet or arm. this was a common custom; cf. shak. troil. v. 2. 69, 169.

'the happiness which you expect will come out of the wood,' i.e. if it comes at all. a jocular form of expressing unlikelihood. there is evidently a reference to some popular song or saying; compare the jeu de robin in toynbee's specimens of old french, p. 224. in the rom. of the rose, 7455, we have an allusion to a 'ioly robin,' who was a gay dancer and a minstrel, and the exact opposite of a jacobin friar. shakespeare's clown in twelfth night (iv. 2. 78) sings of a 'jolly robin' whose lady 'loves another.' and ophelia sang 'bonny sweet robin is all my joy;' haml. iv. 5. 187. 1176 . another proverbial saying, ferne yere , last year; see fern, fürn , in stratmann, and cf. a. s. fyrngēarum frōd , wise with the experience of past years, phœnix, 219. last year's snow will not be seen again. 1190 . he persuades himself that the moon is to pass well beyond the end of the sign leo; thus allowing another day. 1222 . by potente , with a stick, or staff with a spiked end and crutch-like top; cf. somp. ta. d 1776. a potent , in heraldry, is a figure resembling the top of a crutch, consisting of a rectangle laid horizontally above a small square. see rom. of the rose, 368. 1274 .

(ll. 1457-1512 are not in boccaccio.) the story of meleager and the calydonian boar-hunt is told at length in ovid, met. viii. 271, &c.; whence chaucer doubtless took it; cf. l. 1469 with met. viii. 282. the 'mayde,' in l. 1473, was atalanta. 1480 . chaucer seems to be mistaken here. tydeus, according to one account, was meleager's brother; and, according to another, his half-brother. he does not tell us to what 'olde bokes' he refers. 1483 . moder ; his mother althaea; see ovid, met. viii. 445. latin lines : argument of the 12 books of the thebaid of statius. these lines are placed, in the mss., after l. 1498, interrupting the connection. i therefore insert them after l. 1484, which is certainly their proper place. ll. 1485-1510 give a loose rendering of them. i subjoin an epitome, in a more intelligible form; but suppress many details not mentioned in chaucer. book i. polynices and tydeus meet, and become allies. ii. tydeus sets out on an embassy to eteocles at thebes, and escapes an ambush by the way (ll. 1485-1491). he spares mæon, one of his 50 assailants, and sends him to thebes with the news, whilst he himself returns to argos instead of proceeding to thebes (1492-3). iii. maeon (also called haemonides, as being the son of haemon, bk. iii. l. 42) returns to thebes, and relates how tydeus had slain 49 men out of 50. at argos, amphiaraus, the augur, had concealed himself, hoping to delay the war against thebes, which he prophesied would be disastrous; but capaneus forces him from his retirement, and war is resolved upon (1494). iv. the seven chiefs set out against thebes. the army suffers from thirst, but hypsipyle, a lemnian princess, appears, and shews them a river (1495). v. hypsipyle relates the story of 'the furies of lemnos,' i. e. of the lemnian women who killed all the men in the island except thoas, her father, whom she saved. (see leg. of good women, 1467, and note.) while she is speaking, a snake, sent by jupiter, kills her infant, named archemorus. the snake is killed by capaneus (1497, 8). vi. description of the obsequies of archemorus, and of the funeral games (1499). vii. description of the temple of mars (see knightes tale). the allies arrive before thebes, and the city is attacked. amphiaraus is swallowed up by an earthquake (1500). viii. tydeus is slain, after a great slaughter of his enemies (1501). ix. hippomedon, after great deeds of valour, is drowned in the river. death of parthenopaeus (1502, 3). x. capaneus is killed by lightning whilst scaling the walls of thebes (1504, 5). {502} xi. single combat between eteocles and polynices; both are slain (1506-8). xii. creon forbids the burial of the slain invaders. the wives of the six chieftains seek assistance from theseus, king of athens (see knightes tale). argia, wife of polynices, finds and burns her husband's body. theseus slays creon, and the thebans open their gates to him (1509-10). 1485-1491 . from the thebaid, bk. i (see above). felawe , comrade, brother-in-law. polymites , polynices. ethyocles , eteocles. 1492-8 . from the same, books ii-v. hemonides , haemonides, i. e. maeon, son of haemon. asterte , escaped. fifty ; but he only slew 49, though attacked by 50. sevene ; the seven chieftains, who went to besiege thebes. holy serpent , the snake sent by jupiter. welle , (apparently) the stream langia, which refreshed the army (end of bk. iv). the furies , the furious women of lemnos, who killed all the males (but one) in the island. 1499-1505 . from the same, bks. vi-x. archimoris , archemorus, infant son of hypsipyle; honoured by funeral games. amphiorax , amphiaraus; see bk. ii. 105, and note to anelida, 57. argeyes , argives, people of argos. ypomedon , hippomedon; parthonope , parthenopaeus; see note to anelida, 58. cappaneus , capaneus; see note to anelida, 59. 1506-1512 . from the same, bks. xi, xii. argyve , argia, wife of polynices; cf. bk. iv. l. 762, above. brent , burnt; see kn. ta. a 990; but statius says that the thebans opened their gates to theseus, who entered in triumph. i find nothing about any harm done to the city on this occasion. 1514 . but tydeus was meleager's brother; see note to l. 1480. 1518 . leef , leave it alone. usually leve . 1523 . seestow , seest thou; a general observation, not addressed to cassandra in particular, but to every one at large. 1527 . alceste , alcestis; see leg. of good women, 432. 1528 . but , except, unless. yet bell misunderstands it. 1530 . housbonde ; admetus, king of pherae, in thessaly. 1545 . smitted , smutted, disgraced; cf. l. 1546. 1548 . fyn of the paródie , end of the period. chaucer, not being a greek scholar, has somewhat mistaken the form of the word; but, in ms. h., parodie is duly glossed by 'duracion,' shewing the sense intended. it is from the o. f. fem. sb. perióde , or peryóde , of which littré gives an example in the 14th century: ' peryode est le temps et la mesure de la duracion d'une chose;' oresme, thèse de meunier. chaucer, being more familiar with the prefix per- than with the greek περι- , has dropped the i ; and the confusion between per- and par- is extremely common, because both prefixes were denoted, in contracted writing, by the same symbol. we may give up the old attempts at explaining the word otherwise, as we know that the glosses are usually due to the author. 'the end of the period of hector's life was nigh at hand.' {503} lydgate uses the word in the same sense, having caught it up from the present passage :— 'when the paródye of this worthy knyght [hector] aproche shall, without[e] wordes mo, into the fyelde playnly if he go.' siege of troye, bk. iii. ch. 27; ed. 1557, fol. r 6. 'and how that he [ulysses] might[e] not escape the párodýe that was for hym shape; for parchas haue his last[e] terme set,' &c. id., bk. v. ch. 38; fol. dd 3. observe that parodye is here equated to terme . 1558 . from guido; according to whose account hector, having taken a prisoner, was conveying him through the throng, when achilles thrust him through with a spear in a cowardly manner, stealing up to him unperceived. see allit. dest. of troy, ll. 8649-8660; lydgate, siege of troy, bk. iii. ch. 27, fol. s 2, back; shak. troil. v. 6. 27, 8. 1. 1634 . kalendes , an introduction to the beginning; see note to bk. ii. 7. 1653 . lollius ; this incident is in the filostrato, viii. st. 8; i do not find it in guido. 1669 . word and ende , beginning and end; see note to monk. ta. b 3911; and note to bk. ii. 1495. 1689 .

'whereas may god send power to him that wrote thee to take part in composing some "comedy," before he die.' 1789 . 'do not envy any (other) poetry, but be humble.' 1791 . imitated from the concluding lines of the thebaid, xii. 816 :— 'nec tu diuinam æneida tenta, sed longe sequere, et uestigia semper adora .' the sense is—'and kiss their footsteps, wherever you see vergil, &c. pass along.' the reading space is ridiculous; and, in l. 1792, the names virgíle , &c., are accented on the second syllable. steppes means 'foot-prints,' lat. uestigia ; see leg. good women, 2209. 1792 . an important line. chaucer, in this poem, has made use of statius (see l. 1485), ovid (in many places), vergil (occasionally), and {504} homer (not at first hand). lucan seems to be mentioned only out of respect; but see note to bk. ii. 167. he is mentioned again in boethius, bk. iv. pr. 6. 159. 1796 . mismetre , scan wrongly. this shews that chaucer was conscious of his somewhat archaic style, and that there was a danger that some of the syllables might be dropped. 1797 . red , read (by a single person), songe , read aloud, recited in an intoned voice. 1802 . thousandes is to be taken in the literal sense. on one occasion, according to guido, troilus slew a thousand men at once. see the allit. destruction of troy, 9878; lydgate, siege of troy, fol. u 3, back, l. 7. 1806 . so in guido; see allit. destr. of troy, 10302-11; lydgate, siege of troye, bk. iv. ch. 31. cf. l. 1558, and the note. 1807-1827 . these three stanzas are from boccaccio's teseide , xi. 1-3, where, however, they refer to arcita :— 'finito arcita colei nominando la qual nel mondo più che altro amava, l'anima lieve se ne gì volando vêr la concavità del cielo ottava: degli elementi i conuessi lasciando, quivi le stelle erratiche ammirava ... suoni ascoltando pieni di dolcezza. quindi si volse in giù a rimirare le cose abbandonate, e vide il poco globo terreno, a cui d'intorno il mare girava ... ed ogni cosa da nulla stimare a respetto del ciel; e in fine al loco là dove aveva il corpo suo lasciato gli occhi fermò alquanto rivoltato. e fece risa de' pianti dolenti della turba lernea; la vanitate forte dannando delle umane genti, le qua' da tenebrosa cechitate mattamente oscurate nelle menti seguon del mondo la falsa beltate: lasciando il cielo, quindi se ne gio nel loco a cui mercurio la sortio.' holownesse translates 'concavità.' for seventh , b. has 'ottava,' eighth. the seventh sphere is that of saturn, from which he might be supposed to observe the motion of saturn and of all the inferior planets. but surely eighth is more correct; else there is no special sense in 'holownesse.' the eighth sphere is that of the fixed stars; and by taking up a position on the inner or concave surface of this {505} sphere, he would see all the planetary spheres revolving within it. (the 'spheres' were supposed to be concentric shells, like the coats of an onion.) the 'erratic stars,' or wandering stars, are the seven planets. as to the music of their spheres, see notes to parl. foules, ll. 59 and 61. 1810 . in convers leting , leaving behind, on the other side. when, for example, he approached the sphere of mars, it was concave to him; after passing beyond it, it appeared convex . some modern editions of the teseide read connessi (connected parts), but the right reading is conuessi (convex surfaces), for which chaucer substitutes convers . see converse in the new e. dictionary. 1815 . cf. parl. foules, 57. boccaccio had in mind cicero's somnium scipionis . 1825 . sholden , and we ought; we is understood. 1827 . sorted , allotted; ital. 'sortio.' 1828-1837 . chiefly from il filostrato, viii. 28, 29. 1838-1862 . these lines are chaucer's own, and assume a higher strain. 1840 . 'this lyf, my sone, is but a chery-feyre.' hoccleve, de regim. princ. ed. wright, p. 47. see four more similar comparisons in halliwell's dict., s. v. cherry-fair . 1856 . moral gower. this epithet of gower has stuck to him ever since; he moralises somewhat too much. 1857 . strode. concerning this personage, leland discovered the following note in an old catalogue of the worthies of merton college, oxford: 'radulphus strode, nobilis poeta fuit et versificavit librum elegiacum vocatum phantasma radulphi.' in the introduction to his edition of 'pearl,' p. l., mr. gollancz says: 'this ralph strode is identical with the famous philosopher of that name whose philosophical works hold an important place in the history of medieval logic. he was also famous in his time as a controversialist with wiclif, and from wiclif mss., still unprinted, it is possible to gain some insight into strode's religious views.' he was, perhaps, related to the philosopher n. strode, who is mentioned at the end of pt. ii. § 40 of the treatise on the astrolabe as being the tutor, at oxford, of chaucer's son lewis. 1863-5 . from dante, paradiso, xiv. 28-30 :— 'quell' uno e due e tre che sempre vive, e regna sempre in tre e due e uno, non circonscritto, e tutto circonscrive.' {506} additional note to book iii. 674. as the curious word voidee has been suppressed in all previous editions, i add some more examples of it, for some of which i am indebted to dr. murray. it occurs, e.g., in the extremely interesting account of the death of james i of scotland. 'within an owre the kyng askid the voidee , and drank, the travers yn the chambure edraw [= y-drawe , drawn], and every man depairtid and went to rist': (1400) jn. shirley , dethe of james stewarde, kyng of scotys, p. 13, ed. 1818. hence, no doubt, mr. rossetti, in his poem of the king's tragedy, drew the line:—'then he called for the voidee -cup.' 'a voidy of spices': (1548) hall's chron. 14 hen. viii. 'a voidee of spices': (1577-87) holinshed's chron. vol. iii. p. 849. in a collection of ordinances and regulations for the royal household, london, 1790, there are several examples of it. 'the archbishoppe to stand on the kinges right hand, and the king to make him a becke when hee shall take spice and wine . and when the voide is donne, then the king to goe into his chamber; and all other estates to goe into their chambers, or where it shall please them,' &c.: p. 111; in articles ordained by king henry vii. at p. 113, there are minute directions as to the voidè . the chamberlain and others fetch a towel, the cups, and the spice-plates; the king and the bishop take 'spice and wine,' and afterwards the lords and people are served 'largely' with spice and wine also; after which the cups are removed. at p. 36, we read: 'the bourde avoyded [cleared] when wafyrs come with ypocras, or with other swete wynes. the king never taketh a voyd [read voydè ] of comfites and other spices, but standing.' at p. 121: 'as for the voide on twelfth day at night, the king and queene ought to take it in the halle.' at the coronation of queen anne boleyn, there was a voidè 'of spice-plates and wine'; english garner, ed. arber, ii. 50. the voidee was, in fact, a sort of dessert. the word spices included many things besides what it now implies. in the ordinances above-mentioned, there is a list of spices, at p. 103. it includes pepper, saffron, ginger, cloves, maces, cinnamon, nutmegs, dates, prunes, quinces, comfits, raisins, currants, figs, and even rice. in the north of england, even at the present day, it includes sweetmeats, gingerbread, cakes, and dried fruits. {507} the oxford edition of piers the plowman in two volumes, demy 8vo, pp. civ + 1112, uniform with this edition, price £1 11s. 6d. the vision of william concerning piers the plowman in three parallel texts together with richard the redeless by william langland (about 1362-1399 a.d.) edited from numerous manuscripts with preface, notes, and a glossary by the rev. walter w. skeat , litt.d. , ll.d. elrington and bosworth professor of anglo-saxon and fellow of christ's college, cambridge oxford at the clarendon press london: henry frowde oxford university press warehouse, amen corner, e.c. {508} other works by the rev. prof. w. w. skeat, litt.d. an etymological dictionary of the english language , arranged on an historical basis. second edition. 4to, cloth , 2 l. 4 s. a concise etymological dictionary of the english language. fourth edition. crown 8vo, cloth , 5 s. 6 d. a list of english words the etymology of which is illustrated by comparison with icelandic. 4to, 2 s. the principles of english etymology. crown 8vo. first series. the native element. second edition. 10 s. 6 d. second series. the foreign element. 10 s. 6 d. a primer of english etymology. 1 s. 6 d. specimens of early english. part ii. from robert of gloucester to gower ( a.d. 1298 to a.d. 1393). by r. morris , ll.d., and w. w. skeat , litt. d. third edition. extra fcap. 8vo, cloth , 7 s. 6 d. specimens of english literature , from the 'ploughman's crede' to the 'shepheardes calender' ( a.d. 1394 to a.d. 1579). with introduction, notes, and glossarial index. extra fcap. 8vo, cloth , 7 s. 6 d. the vision of william concerning piers the plowman , by william langland . with notes, &c. sixth edition. extra fcap. 8vo, cloth , 4 s. 6 d. chaucer. the prioresses tale; sir thopas; the monkes tale; the clerkes tale; the squieres tale, &c. seventh edition. extra fcap. 8vo, cloth , 4 s. 6 d. chaucer. the tale of the man of lawe; the pardoners tale; the second nonnes tale; the chanouns yemannes tale. new edition. extra fcap. 8vo, cloth , 4 s. 6 d. chaucer. the minor poems. crown 8vo, cloth , 10 s. 6 d. chaucer. the legend of good women. crown 8vo, cloth , 6 s. the student's chaucer. being a complete edition of the works, edited from numerous mss., with introduction and glossary. in one vol., crown 8vo, cloth , 7 s. 6 d. * * * glossarial index to the above, crown 8vo, limp cloth , 1 s. 6 d. chaucerian and other pieces , being a supplementary volume to the above. edited, from numerous mss., by w. w. skeat , litt.d. 8vo, 18 s. the oxford chaucer. on oxford india paper, cloth extra , 9 s. 6 d. the chaucer canon. with a discussion of the works associated with the name of geoffrey chaucer. crown 8vo, 3 s. 6 d. net. the tale of gamelyn. edited with notes, glossary, &c. extra fcap. 8vo, stiff covers , 1 s. 6 d. twelve facsimiles of old english mss. , with transcriptions and introduction. 4to, 7 s. 6 d. oxford at the clarendon press london: henry frowde oxford university press warehouse, amen corner, e.c. notes.

[9] see the romaunt of the rose (in vol. i.), ll. 5659-5666; and the note to l. 5661. it is also tolerably obvious, that chaucer selected metre 5 of book ii. of boethius for poetical treatment in his 'former age,' because jean de meun had selected for similar treatment the very same passage; see rom. de la rose, ll. 8395-8406. [10] there is a copy of this in the british museum, ms. addit. 10341. [11] ms. harl. 44 (wülker); not ms. harl. 43, as in warton, who has confused this ms. with that next mentioned. [12] ms. harl. 43 (wülker); not ms. harl. 44, as in warton. [13] there is a better copy than either of the above in ms. royal 18 a. xiii. the b. m. catalogue of the royal mss., by casley, erroneously attributes this translation to lydgate. and there is yet a fourth copy, in ms. sloane 554. the royal ms. begins, more correctly:—'in suffisaunce of cunnyng and of wyt.' [14] ms. i. 53. [15] ms. b. 5. there is yet another ms. in the library of trinity college, oxford, no. 75; and others in the bodleian library (ms. rawlinson 151), in the cambridge university library (gg. iv. 18), and in the phillipps collection (as in note 5 below). [16] 'the boke of comfort, translated into englesse tonge. enprented in the exempt monastery of tavestok in denshyre, by me, dan thomas rychard, monke; 1525. 4to.'—lowndes. [17] the ms. is now in the collection of sir thomas phillipps; no. 1099. [18] he here implies that chaucer's translation was by no means the only one then in existence; a remarkable statement. [19] ms. inserts full , needlessly. [20] perhaps read in. [21] ms. neye. [22] ms. hy m self. [23] ms. theym self. [24] printed feldes by mr. stewart. [25] observe that this line is due to chaucer's gloss , not to his text. [26] ms. thisee (!). [27] ms. hem self. [28] printed thise by mr. stewart. [29] ms. this (giving no sense). [30] mr. stewart omits thus. [31] ms. parelous (!). this shews that walton's text can be corrected by chaucer's. [32] yet we must remember that 'the former age' only reproduces a part of this metre; and that it also introduces a passage from jerome, besides reminiscences of ovid and of le roman de la rose; as shewn in the notes. [33] mr. stewart adds another instance, from bk. iii. met. 5. 5 :— and that the last ile in the see that hight tyle, be thral to thee. i hope this was unintentional, for they are poor verses. it is higher praise to say that, especially in the metres, chaucer's prose often flows well, with a certain melody of its own. mr. stewart also gives some instances in which he supposes that chaucer 'actually reproduces the original latin metre;' but they are imperfect and unintended. [34] mr. stewart quotes this as: 'a long unagreable dwellynges;' but 'draweth a-long' is a fair translation of 'protrahit.' [35] 365 is the number of the line; see p. 164 below. i refer to boethius by the letter 'b.', meaning the text as printed in the present volume, giving the line of the text as well as the number of the prose or metre, so that every passage can easily be found. [36] the prefixed asterisk marks a doubtful or wrong instance. [37] i omit the comparison of bk. iii. ll. 8-14 with boethius; for the whole stanza is copied from the filostrato , bk. iii. st. 75. also, that of l. 373 with b. iii. met. 9. 1; for l. 373 is copied from the filostrato , bk. iii. st. 15. [38] i omit mention of l. 2839 (compared with b. ii. met. 3. 14); for it is taken from the teseide , bk. ix, 10, 11. [39] the three points are: (1) avarice is insatiable, l. 2321, which answers to 'finem quaerendi non inuenit,' quoted as from seneca, but really from palladius; see albertani brixiensis liber consolationis, ed. t. sundby, p. 37: (2) good and evil are two contraries, l. 2479; compare the same, p. 96: (3) fortune the nurse, l. 2635, translated from 'fortuna usque nunc me fouit'; see the same, p. 89. [40] i have noted a few inaccuracies, chiefly due to confusion of c and t (which are written alike), and to abbreviations. at p. 2, l. 13, for 'p ro cede' read 'p er cede.' at p. 9, l. 28, for 'basilicis' read 'basilius.' at p. 11, l. 32, read 'auauntede.' at p. 12, l. 10, read 'c on uict'; &c. cf. note to bk. v. pr. 6. 82. [41] here recte is miswritten for recta , clearly because the scribe was still thinking of the latter syllable of the preceding sponte . but observe that ch. has 'the rightes,' a translation of recta . this proves at once that chaucer did not use this particular copy as his original; and of course the peculiar mode in which it is written precludes such a supposition. but i believe it to be copied from chaucer's copy, all the same. [42] this shews how entirely wrong an editor would be who should change the forms into atrides and agamemnon ; unless, indeed, he were to give due notice. for it destroys the evidence. note also, that agamenon is the usual m. e. form. it appears as agamenoun in troil. iii. 382. [43] hence it is easy to see that when chaucer's glosses agree, as they sometimes do, with those in notker's old high german version or in any other version, the agreement is due to the fact that both translators had similar latin glosses before them. [44] my text has thonder-light , as in the mss.; but leyte or leyt is better; see note to the line (p. 422 ), and see above, p. xlii , l. 8. [45] there is a later edition by peiper, said to be the best; but it is out of print, and i failed to obtain a copy. but i have also collated the latin text in the delphin edition, ed. valpy, 1823, and the edition by renatus vallinus, 1656; both of these contain useful notes. [46] mr. rossetti has a note, shewing that prof. morley's figures are incorrect. he himself reckons troilus as containing 8246 lines, because the number of stanzas in book v. of dr. furnivall's print of ms. harl. 3943 is wrongly given as 268 instead of 267. [47] for a fuller comparison with this poem, see § 21 below; p. lxv . [48] lydgate accepts chaucer's view without question. he says—'and of this syege wrote eke lollius'; siege of troye, ed. 1555, fol. b 2, back. [49] usually called guido de colonna, probably because he was supposed to belong to a famous family named colonna; but his name seems to have been taken from the name of a place (see note 1 on p. lvi). my quotations from guido are from ms. mm. 5. 14, in the cambridge university library. [50] he refers to the story of troy as existing 'in the latyn and the frenshe'; siege of troye, fol. b 1, back; and explains 'the latyn' as 'guido.' [51] in an italian work entitled 'testi inediti di storia trojana,' by e. gorra, turin, 1887, a passage is quoted at p. 137, from book xiii of guido, which says that terranova, on the s. coast of sicily, was also called 'columpne herculis,' and gorra suggests that this was the place whence guido derived his name 'delle colonne.' at any rate, guido was much interested in these 'columns'; see lydgate, siege of troye, fol. m 4. i think tropæus , from gk. τροπαῖα , may refer to these columnæ ; or guido may have been connected with tropea , on the w. coast of calabria, less than fifty miles from messina, where he was a judge. [52] 'homerus ... fingens multa que non fuerunt, et que fuerunt aliter transformando'; prologus. see the e. translation in the gest hystoriale, or alliterative troy-book, ll. 38-47; lydgate, siege of troye, fol. b 2. [53] see allit. troy-book, ll. 60-79. [54] see allit. troy-book, ll. 3922-34; lydgate, siege of troye, fol. f 3, back. [55] ms. penatos. [56] the mention of escaphilo, i.e. ascalaphus, in book v. 319, was perhaps suggested by the mention of ascalaphus by guido (after dictys, i. 13, homer, il. ii. 512) as being one of the grecian leaders; see allit. troy-book, l. 4067. [57] i. e. glove; from gk. χείρ , hand, and θήκη , case. [58] put for xenium ( ξένιον ), a gift, present. [59] cf. 'and save hir browes ioyneden y-fere'; troil. v. 813. [60] talke is not in the glossary. as lk is a common way of writing kk (as shewn in my paper on 'ghost-words' for the phil. soc.), the word is really takke , a variant of take ; and the sense is 'let him take.' [61] lydgate began his troy-book on oct. 31, 1412, and finished it in 1420; see this shewn in my letter to the academy , may 7, 1892. [62] hence it was not written by sir hugh eglintoun, if he died either in 1376 or 1381; see pref. to allit. troy-book, pp. xvii, xxv. [63] ms. to disport; but to is needless . [64] ms. i for; i is needless . [65] two false rimes; ye and aweye ; dispyt and bright (correctly, bright e ). [66] not clene , as in the st. john's ms. and in the phillipps ms.; for chaucer never rimes clene (with open e ) with such words as grene , quene (with close e ); see, on this point, the remarks on my rime-index to troilus, published for the chaucer society. ms. harl. 2392 likewise has sheene , a word in which the long e is of 'variable' quality. [67] some guess that it means 'tres gentil chaucer.' but this seems to me very improbable, if not stupid. *** end of the project gutenberg ebook chaucer's works, volume 2 — boethius and troilus *** updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed. creating the works from print editions not protected by u.s. copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties. special rules, set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the project gutenberg™ concept and trademark. project gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for an ebook, except by following the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use of the project gutenberg trademark. if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the trademark license is very
