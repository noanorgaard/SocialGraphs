The record featured the singles \"[[I Alone]]\", \"[[All Over You (Live song)|All Over You]]\", and the number-one US Modern Rock hits \"[[Selling the Drama]]\" and \"[[Lightning Crashes]]\". \"Lightning Crashes\" also stayed at the top of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for ten consecutive weeks. The band appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where they played \"I Alone\" and \"Selling the Drama\", and they performed for the first time in the UK, on ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]''.\n\nThe success of these singles eventually gained ''Throwing Copper'' the number one position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart on May 6, 1995, its 52nd week on the chart. It was the third longest gap between an album first charting and reaching number one, behind [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|eponymous album]] in 1976 (58 weeks) and [[Paula Abdul]]'s ''[[Forever Your Girl]]'' in 1989 (64 weeks).

It took its name from [[Samadhi]], a state of [[Hindu]] meditation. The album contained four Modern Rock hit singles, but failed to match its predecessor's success, with sales reaching two million. The band performed \"[[Lakini's Juice]]\" and \"Heropsychodreamer\" from the album on ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nJerry Harrison returned as co-producer for 1999's ''[[The Distance to Here]]'', which entered the US album chart at number four and featured the hit single \"[[The Dolphin's Cry]]\". In 2000, Live embarked on a co-headlining tour with [[Counting Crows]]. On that tour, Counting Crows' lead singer, [[Adam Duritz]], often joined Live for their performance of \"The Dolphin's Cry\", while Kowalczyk sang a verse of \"[[Hanginaround]]\" with Counting Crows.\n\n===''V'', ''Birds of Pray'', and ''Awake: The Best of Live'': 2001\u20132004===\nOn September 18, 2001, the experimental ''[[V (Live album)|V]]'' (originally to be called ''Ecstatic Fanatic'') was released to mixed reviews. The first single was \"[[Simple Creed]]\", which featured a rap by [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], but the events of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], which occurred a week before ''V'' was released, meant that the melancholic \"[[Overcome (Live song)|Overcome]]\" received significant airplay and became the album's selling point. ''V'' reached number 22 in the US. Also in 2001, Live contributed a live version of the song \"I Alone\" to the charity album ''[[Live in the X Lounge|Live in the X Lounge IV]]''.\n\nIn May 2003, the band released the Jim Wirt-produced ''[[Birds of Pray]]'', which reached number 28 on the US album chart, boosted by the unexpected success of the single \"[[Heaven (Live song)|Heaven]]\", Live's first U.S. Hot 100 hit single since \"The Dolphin's Cry\".\n\nIn November 2004, Live released a [[greatest hits]] compilation, ''[[Awake: The Best of Live]]''. ''Awake'' included \"[[We Deal in Dreams]]\", a previously unreleased song from the ''Throwing Copper'' sessions, a [[cover version]] of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[I Walk the Line]]\", and a new version of their song \"[[Run Away (Live song)|Run Away]]\", with [[Shelby Lynne]] sharing lead vocals with Kowalczyk. A deluxe version of the album included a DVD with 22 music videos and an interview with Kowalczyk.\n\n===''Songs from Black Mountain'', ''Radiant Sea'', and live DVD: 2005\u20132008===\nIn 2005, Live signed to [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]]'s [[Epic Records|Epic]] label.

The record peaked at number 52 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart, and reached number three on the ''Billboard'' Independent album chart. The first single was \"[[The River (Live song)|The River]]\".\n\nOn [[American Idol (season 5)|season five]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', finalist [[Chris Daughtry]] was accused of performing Live's version of Johnny Cash's \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" and claiming it as his own interpretation.

Smith said, \"I first heard (the song) in '95 when we were putting together the ''[[Mallrats]]'' soundtrack.
