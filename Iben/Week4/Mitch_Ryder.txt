They assembled a 10 piece band of white R&B musicians: from [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; Jimmy Wilson (trumpet), Bob Shipley (sax), Jimmy Loomis (sax), Don Lehnhoff (trombone), Frank Invernizzi (organ); from Chicago, Illinois; [[John Siomos]] (drums), Bob Slawson (guitar), Carmine Riale (bass guitar); from Miami, Florida; Andy Dio (trumpet); from New York; Johnny ?

Redding and four members of his touring band, [[The Bar-Kays]], died in a plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin the following day, December 10, 1967.\n\nRyder's musical endeavors were less successful after the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Ryder's participation with the Detroit Wheels ended just as the [[counterculture]] was becoming dominant in 1968. During 1968, trumpeters Mike Thuroff and John Stefan were hired to tour with his horn section and band. Thuroff and Stefan also recorded the trumpet parts of Ryder's song, \"Ring My Bell\". This song was not permitted to be played by radio in many states due to its sexual innuendos. Ryder had one hit single from that period, a cover version of \"[[What Now My Love (song)|What Now, My Love]]\". In the early 70's, he formed the band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. The only other original Wheel in the group was the drummer [[Johnny \"Bee\" Badanjek|John Badanjek]]; other members were guitarists [[Steve Hunter]], [[Brett Tuggle]], organist Harry Phillips, and bassist W.R. Cooke. A single album was released by this grouping, a 1971 self-titled [[long play|LP]] issued on [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount Records]] (US #176 in 1972). They had a hit with their version of the [[Lou Reed]]-penned song \"[[Rock & Roll (The Velvet Underground song)|Rock & Roll]]\", which Reed liked enough to ask Steve Hunter to join his backing band. Detroit was tagged by the critics as the \"American Rolling Stones\".  \n\nAccording to [[AllMusic]] (which calls Ryder \"the unsung hero\" of Michigan rock and roll), Ryder withdrew from music in 1973 after experiencing throat trouble,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> moving to Colorado with his wife and taking up writing and painting. In 1983, Ryder returned to a major label with the [[John Mellencamp]]-produced album ''Never Kick a Sleeping Dog''. The album featured a cover version of the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song \"[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]\", which was Ryder's last score on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nRyder continues to record and tour in the United States and Europe.
