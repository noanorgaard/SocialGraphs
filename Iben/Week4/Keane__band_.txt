The track was featured on Jansen's second studio album ''Elba''. In 2017, a version of Tom Chaplin's solo track \"Solid Gold\", featuring alternative pop singer JONES, was released as a single.\n\n==Musical style and themes==\nTim Rice-Oxley and Dominic Scott were the main writers of the band's songs during their early years. When Scott left in 2001, Rice-Oxley became the main composer.<ref name=\"Songs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/faq/#writes|title=FAQ \u2013 Who writes the songs?|work=Keaneshaped.com| access-date =4 August 2006}}</ref> However, Rice-Oxley credits the rest of the band on all compositions, so that royalties for song credits are shared.<ref name=\"Songs\" />\n\nKeane usually harbours an ample, reverberated, melodic, slow- to mid-tempo fully orchestrated sound, somehow reminiscent of [[Elton John]]'s early and middle career, and their more introspective songs have brought comparisons to [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Jeff Buckley]].\n\nWhile guitars have been (minimally) present even in their early work, their appearance in the final mix has always been slight, and while Chaplin has stepped up as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as to be more than barely noticed. For this matter, they have been dubbed as \"the band with no guitars\", thanks to their heavily piano-based sound. By using [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] and [[distortion]] effects on their pianos and similar keyboards, they often create sounds that aren't immediately recognisable as piano. Rice-Oxley said during an interview in Los Angeles that they tend to think piano-related music is boring and what they really wanted to do was try something different. He referred to the piano as an odd instrument to form part of a rock band instrumentation, comparing it to the Beatles' set of instruments. Rice-Oxley's distortion piano has been key to most of Keane's multifaceted style and most definitely their most recognizable asset.\n\nKeane have covered songs by artists such as [[U2]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIeY5sWWNgM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/SIeY5sWWNgM| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=with or without you-keane | date=29 May 2007|publisher=YouTube |access-date=4 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Rufus Wainwright]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7COEI4vm1E | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/_7COEI4vm1E| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=keane dinner at eight |publisher=YouTube |date=16 July 2007 |access-date=4 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Depeche Mode]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTzQC9alliU  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/eTzQC9alliU |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=Keane \u2013 Enjoy The Silence ( Depeche mode cover ) |date=23 May 2007 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=4 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], the Beatles, [[the Cult]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]].
