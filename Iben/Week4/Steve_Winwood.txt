Though primarily a guitarist, keyboard player, and vocalist prominent for his distinctive [[Soul music|soulful]] high [[tenor]] voice, Winwood also plays instruments including [[mandolin]], bass, drums and percussion.\n\nWinwood achieved fame during the 1960s and 1970s as an integral member of three successful bands: [[the Spencer Davis Group]] (1964\u20131967), [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] (1967\u20131969 and 1970\u20131974), and [[Blind Faith]] (1969). During the 1980s, his solo career flourished and he had a number of hit singles, including \"[[While You See a Chance]]\" (1980) from the album ''[[Arc of a Diver]]'' and \"[[Valerie (Steve Winwood song)|Valerie]]\" (1982) from ''[[Talking Back to the Night]]'' (\"Valerie\" became a hit when it was re-released with a remix from Winwood's 1987 compilation album ''[[Chronicles (Steve Winwood album)|Chronicles]]'').\n\nWinwood's 1986 album ''[[Back in the High Life]]'' marked his career zenith, with hit singles including \"[[Back in the High Life Again]]\", \"[[The Finer Things (song)|The Finer Things]]\", and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit \"[[Higher Love]]\". He reached number one on the Hot 100 again with \"[[Roll with It (Steve Winwood song)|Roll with It]]\" (1988) from the album [[Roll with It (album)|''Roll with It'']], with \"[[Don't You Know What the Night Can Do?]]\" and \"[[Holding On (Steve Winwood song)|Holding On]]\" also charting highly the same year. Although his hit singles ceased after the 1980s, he continued to release new albums. His most recent album, ''[[Nine Lives (Steve Winwood album)|Nine Lives]]'', was released in 2008. The 2004 song \"[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call on Me]]\", built on a sample of \"Valerie\", spent five weeks at No. 1 on the [[UK singles chart]].\n\nIn 2004, Winwood was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Traffic. He has won two [[Grammy Awards]] and an [[Ivor Novello Award]], and has been honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon. In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Winwood the 33rd-greatest singer. In 2025, Winwood was appointed a [[Member of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the King's [[2025 Birthday Honours|Birthday Honours]].\n\n==Early life==\nWinwood was born on 12 May 1948<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/steve-winwood-from-mr-fantasy-to-mr-entertainment-68227/|title=Steve Winwood: From Mr. Fantasy to Mr. Entertainment|first1=Anthony|last1=DeCurtis|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=1 December 1988|access-date=2 May 2019|archive-date=2 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502051229/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/steve-winwood-from-mr-fantasy-to-mr-entertainment-68227/|url-status=live}}</ref> in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth, Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brumbeat.net/sdgroup.htm|title=Spencer Davis Group|website=Brumbeat.net|access-date=10 January 2018|archive-date=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227124433/http://www.brumbeat.net/sdgroup.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birminghamworld.uk/news/handsworth-birmingham-famous-people-4114466|title=The 15 famous faces from Handsworth, Birmingham|date=22 April 2023 }}</ref> His father Lawrence, a [[foundryman]] by trade, was a semi-professional musician, playing mainly the saxophone and clarinet.
