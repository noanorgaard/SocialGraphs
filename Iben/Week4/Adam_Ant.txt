He gained popularity as the lead singer of [[new wave music|new wave]] group [[Adam and the Ants]] and later as a solo artist, scoring 10 UK top ten hits from 1980 to 1983, including three UK No. 1 singles. He has also worked as an actor, appearing in many films and television episodes.\n\nAnt began his musical career playing bass in the band [[Bazooka Joe (band)|Bazooka Joe]]. From 1977 to 1982 he performed with Adam and the Ants. Their debut album ''[[Dirk Wears White Sox]]'' (1979) reached number one on the [[UK Indie Chart|UK Independent Albums Chart]]. Before recording his debut album as Adam and the Ants, he asked producer [[Malcolm McLaren]] to manage his band; McLaren instead took his backing band to form [[Bow Wow Wow]]. Ant regrouped with new members, including [[Marco Pirroni]], to release his second album ''[[Kings of the Wild Frontier]]'' (1980). It reached number one in the [[UK Album Chart]], spawned three hit singles, became the UK number-one selling album in 1981, and won [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|Best British Album]] at the [[Brit Awards 1982|1982 BRIT Awards]]. He released his third and final album with the group, ''[[Prince Charming (album)|Prince Charming]]'' (1981), which spawned two UK number-one singles \"[[Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)|Stand and Deliver]]\" and \"[[Prince Charming (Adam and the Ants song)|Prince Charming]]\".\n\nIn 1982, he began a solo career, retaining [[Marco Pirroni]] as co-songwriter. His first solo album was ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'' (1982), from which the debut single \"[[Goody Two-Shoes (song)|Goody Two Shoes]]\" reached number one in the UK and Australia in 1982, and became his first top 20 hit in the United States on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 16 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, becoming his most successful solo album. His next two solo albums ''[[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]]'' (1983) and ''[[Vive Le Rock]]'' (1985) were less commercially successful. Ant began to focus on an acting career, performing on stage and in film and television roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He released his fourth solo album ''[[Manners & Physique]]'' (1990) which was produced by [[Andr\u00e9 Cymone]] and featured a [[Minneapolis sound]]. Despite the US top 20 success of the single \"[[Room at the Top (Adam Ant song)|Room at the Top]]\", Ant was dropped from [[MCA Records]], and his album ''[[Persuasion (Adam Ant album)|Persuasion]]'' (1991) was shelved and never officially released. He signed with [[Capitol Records]] to release ''[[Wonderful (Adam Ant album)|Wonderful]]'' (1995). The single \"Wonderful\" became Ant's third US top 40 hit single.\n\nSince 2010, Ant has continued his music career, recording and releasing a new album ''[[Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter]]'' (2013, UK number 25), and completing eight full-length UK national tours, five US national tours, and two Australian tours. A further album, ''Bravest of the Brave'', was recorded in 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://louderthanwar.com/adam-ant-announces-bravest-of-the-brave-new-album-and-single-and-gig-details/|title = Adam Ant announces 'Bravest of the Brave' new album and single and gig details|date = 12 August 2014}}</ref> and is still awaiting release.\n\n==Early life==\nStuart Goddard was born in [[Marylebone]], [[London]], the only child of Leslie Alfred Goddard and Betty Kathleen Smith.

They were initially managed by [[Jordan (Pamela Rooke)|Jordan]] from the [[Sex (boutique)|SEX]] boutique on [[Kings Road]]. His debut as a recording artist was the song \"[[Deutscher Girls]]\", which featured on the film's soundtrack, along with \"Plastic Surgery\" which was performed in the film. In late 1979 they released their debut album ''[[Dirk Wears White Sox]]'' (1979, [[Do It Records]]) featuring [[Matthew Ashman]] on guitar, [[Andy Warren (British musician)|Andy Warren]] on bass and [[David Barbarossa|Dave Barbarossa]] on drums.\n\nAnt approached [[Malcolm McLaren]] to manage the band, who subsequently hired the rest of the Ants to form [[Bow Wow Wow]] fronted by [[Annabella Lwin]]. The second version of Adam and the Ants featured [[Marco Pirroni]] (guitar), [[Kevin Mooney]] (bass guitar), and two drummers, Terry Lee Miall and [[Chris Hughes (record producer)|Chris Hughes]] (formerly of [[Dalek I Love You]]), who used the name \"Merrick\". The band signed a deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] and recorded ''[[Kings of the Wild Frontier]]'' during the summer of 1980. The album gained success in the United Kingdom, and the \"Antmania\" that ensued put the band at the forefront of the [[New Romantic]] movement. The single \"[[Antmusic]]\" went to No.&nbsp;2 on the [[UK singles chart]] by December 1980. Following the departure of Mooney in February 1981, bassist [[Gary Tibbs]], formerly of [[Roxy Music]], joined the band.\n\nIn November 1981, Adam & the Ants released the album, ''[[Prince Charming (album)|Prince Charming]],'' that featured two United Kingdom No.&nbsp;1 singles \u2013 \"[[Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)|Stand and Deliver]]\" and the title track, \"[[Prince Charming (Adam and the Ants song)|Prince Charming]]\" \u2013 as well as the No.&nbsp;3 UK hit \"[[Ant Rap]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-artist-formerly-known-as-prince-charming-629059.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201121405/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-artist-formerly-known-as-prince-charming-629059.html |archive-date=2008-12-01 |url-access=limited |url-status=live|title=The Independent, December 2000|work=The Independent|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref> In March 1982 the group disbanded.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |date=2011-04-27 |title=The rise and fall of Adam Ant |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8478052/The-rise-and-fall-of-Adam-Ant.html |access-date=2023-10-15 |website=The Telegraph |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===1982\u20132001: Solo career===\nA few months after Adam and the Ants split, Ant launched his solo career and retained Pirroni as guitarist and co-songwriter.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Merrick also briefly stayed as drummer and producer for the UK edition of the first solo hit single \"[[Goody Two-Shoes (song)|Goody Two Shoes]]\"\u2014which made it to No. 1 in the UK\u2014and demos for the upcoming ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'' album, before moving on to other production work.<ref name=\"gaznterrycontractualsep82\">News of Adam No.2, p.7, Arlington Press Ltd UK1982</ref> The ''Friend or Foe'' album also produced another top ten single, \"[[Friend or Foe (Adam Ant song)|Friend or Foe]]\", which reached No. 9 in September 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/adam%20%26%20the%20ants|title=Official charts for artist: Adam and the Ants|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=22 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028161110/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/adam%20%26%20the%20ants/|archive-date=28 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnt recruited a new band for touring, consisting of new dual drummers Bogdan Wiczling (ex-[[Fingerprintz]]) and Barry Watts (ex-[[Q-Tips (band)|Q-Tips]]), plus guitarist [[Cha Burns]] (also ex-Fingerprintz), bassist [[Chris Constantinou]] and the former Q-Tips brass section of trumpeter Tony Hughes and twin saxophonists Stewart van Blandamer and Steve Farr.<ref>Sleevenotes for single ''Desperate But Not Serious''</ref> The new band made its debut at London's [[London Astoria|Astoria]] Theatre on 1 October 1982.

In his 31 December 2010 interview for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', Ant discussed the [[side effects]] of medication for his bipolar condition: \"In the past I've been a robot. It's been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on [[sodium valproate]] for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time \u2013 and piled on the weight. I might as well have been dead.
