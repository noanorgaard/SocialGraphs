After they played a number of shows in [[Oshawa]] with a mix of original and cover material, Martin departed, and the band placed an ad for a replacement bassist. Chris Eacrett replied and was accepted after auditioning. During that time, Turner and Maida met songwriter and producer [[Arnold Lanni]], the owner of Arnyard Studios. The band, with Lanni, commenced writing and recording some material under the As If name.\n\nSoon after, the band changed their name to Our Lady Peace, after a [[Mark Van Doren]] poem of the same name.

Writing and recording continued with session drummer John Bouvette.\n\nWith managers Rob Lanni and Eric Lawrence of Coalition Entertainment representing the band, short showcases were arranged with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Canada]], [[EMI|EMI Canada]], and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Canada]].

Its second single, \"Innocent\", was also very popular, peaking at No. 2 in Canada, and regained popularity in 2008 after a cover performance on ''[[American Idol]]''. Gravity proved to be more successful than Spiritual Machines in both America and Canada, due to the success of the singles; it reached No. 2 in Canada and No. 9 in the US, their highest charting album in the US. In between their fifth and sixth albums, OLP released their first live album, titled simply ''[[Live (Our Lady Peace album)|Live]]'', which contains a selection of the band's hits from their first five albums as played throughout tours in various Canadian cities.\n\nIn August 2005, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Healthy in Paranoid Times]]'', which included the singles \"[[Angels/Losing/Sleep]]\", \"Will the Future Blame Us\", and \"Where Are You?\" According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', it took 1165 days to create it, and its twelve tracks were chosen from forty-five that the band had written and produced.

There were two previously unreleased songs on the album, \"Kiss on the Mouth\" and \"Better Than Here\". Steve Mazur wrote in a blog on the band's fan club that the new songs on the disc were two unreleased songs from the ''[[Healthy in Paranoid Times]]'' sessions. The collection also included a bonus DVD containing live concert footage and exclusive interviews at the [[Massey Hall]] concert. The single \"Kiss on the Mouth\", the first off ''A Decade'', has received play on radio stations across Canada.  Lead vocalist Raine Maida began work on his first [[solo album]], ''[[The Hunters Lullaby]]'', released in 2007, while the remaining members of the band pursued other personal endeavours. The hiatus would result in the longest time gap between OLP studio albums to date.\n\nThe band began working on ''[[Burn Burn (album)|Burn Burn]]'', their seventh studio album, in February 2007.

The album includes the popular singles \"[[Naveed (song)|Naveed]]\" and \"[[Somewhere Out There (Our Lady Peace song)|Somewhere Out There]]\", as well as lesser-known songs such as \"Car Crash\" and \"Stealing Babies\".  That same month, the band completed the new material, with Raine calling the new album \"huge\", and noted it as being a \"proper rock album again\", featuring a return to the raw originality of the band's first album ''[[Naveed (album)|Naveed]]'', though a \"little more [[maturity (psychological)|mature]]\".<ref name=\"OLP\">{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Lowdown/2008/05/13/5551481-ca.html|title=interview with Raine Maida|publisher=Canoe|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110524163703/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Lowdown/2008/05/13/5551481-ca.html|archive-date=May 24, 2011|url-status=usurped|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> Maida produced the album himself, noting his excitement over \"not (having had) anybody intrude on (recording) sessions\".<ref name=\"OLP\" /> The album was released in North America on July 21, 2009, to mixed reviews, though the album later received Gold status in Canada.<ref name=\"Release\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090509164741/http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2309071 Our Lady Peace set to release their seventh studio album July 21] \u2013 ''Tradingmarkets.com''.
