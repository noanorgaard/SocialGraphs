They were a [[roots rock]] band and described as \"perhaps the biggest supergroup of all time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-traveling-wilburys-mn0000015264 |title=The Traveling Wilburys Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n\nOriginating from an idea discussed by Harrison and Lynne during the sessions for Harrison's 1987 album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'', the band formed in April 1988 after the five members united to record a bonus track for Harrison's next European single. When this collaboration, \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", was deemed too good for such a limited release, the group agreed to record a full album, titled ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'', released in October 1988. Following Orbison's death in December 1988, the Wilburys continued as a quartet and released a second album, incongruously titled ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]'', in 1990.\n\nThe release of their debut album was much anticipated because of the stature of the participants. The band members adopted tongue-in-cheek pseudonyms as half-brothers from the fictional Wilbury family of travelling musicians. ''Vol. 1'' was a critical and commercial success, helping to revitalise Dylan's and Petty's careers. In 1990, the album won the [[Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].\n\nAlthough Harrison envisioned a series of Wilburys albums and a film about the band, to be produced through his company [[HandMade Films|HandMade]], the group became dormant after 1991 and never officially reunited, though the individual members continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects at various times. Harrison died in 2001, followed by Petty in 2017, leaving Dylan and Lynne as the only surviving members. After being unavailable for several years, the two Wilburys albums were reissued by the Harrison estate in the 2007 box set ''[[The Traveling Wilburys Collection]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n{{quote box|align=left|quote= None of this would've happened without him.

Keltner said that from his conversations with Lynne, Petty and Dylan, they were all keen to reunite, whereas Harrison wavered in his enthusiasm.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=231}} \n\nAfter his 1991 tour of Japan \u2013 his first series of concerts since 1974 \u2013 Harrison spoke of a possible Traveling Wilburys tour:\n{{blockquote|That would be something I'd like to experience. I've always played around in my own mind what a Wilburys tour could be. Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys? It's an intriguing thought. We could have a great band up there and the four of us could play acoustic if we wanted to. We could all sing \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and Bob could sing \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\". Or we could just sing our individual songs and make them Wilbury tunes, as if we'd recorded them that way. Whatever it was, we could do it.}}\n\nThe Wilburys tour never came about. Petty said about the Wilburys touring:\n{{blockquote|I think it would work, if we wanted to do it. I don't think we ever considered it, really. There were a lot of nights when the conversation would roll around to that. But I don't think anybody ever took it seriously. I think it would ruin it in a way. Then you're obligated to be responsible and it's not in the character of that group. It would make it very formal and that would be the wrong spirit.}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n{{quote box|quote= One of the most amazing things ever about the Wilburys was this poles-apart thing of Roy [Orbison] and Bob Dylan.

The editors also recognise the band as \"the antithesis of a supergroup\", due to the musicians' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project.{{sfn|Romanowski|George-Warren|1995|p=1014}} [[AllMusic]] managing editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] has similarly written: \"It's impossible to picture a supergroup with a stronger pedigree than that (all that's missing is a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stone]]), but in another sense it's hard to call the Wilburys a true supergroup, since they arrived nearly two decades after the all-star craze of the '70s peaked, and they never had the self-important air of nearly all the other supergroups.
