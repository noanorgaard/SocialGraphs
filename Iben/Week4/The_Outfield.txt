They performed in and around England until a demo of theirs had them signed to [[Columbia Records|Columbia/CBS Records]] in 1984.<ref name=tribune/>\n\nSpinks adopted the name 'Baseball Boys' from a teen gang called \"The Baseball Furies\" in the [[cult film|cult]] film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', a movie he had just seen. Although he used the name as a joke and \"just to be outrageous\",<ref name=\"lat\"/> record company people responded favourably. The band acquired a reputation as a very \"American-sounding\" group and signed in the United States after playing for just a few months in England. Their manager, an American living in England, recommended a new band name with a similar attitude since 'Baseball Boys' seemed too \"tacky\" and \"tongue-in-cheek\". Spinks said, \"The Outfield was the most left-wing kind of thing we liked.\"<ref name=tribune>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1986/08/01/in-this-outfield-they-root-root-root-for-soccer/|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=In This Outfield, They Root, Root, Root For Soccer|date=1 August 1986|first=Tom|last=Popson}}</ref>\n\nSpinks expressed an interest in [[baseball]], while also being a devoted fan of [[association football]]. He claimed that the group \"didn't know what an outfield was\" until they visited the U.S. He said, \"We're just learning about baseball. It's an acquired taste and we're trying to acquire a taste for it.\"<ref name=\"lat\"/> He expounded in a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article,\n\n{{blockquote|The thing about American sports\u2013baseball and football\u2013is that they're far more show business, far more a spectacle, than British sports.

Spinks made a point of mentioning in interviews that the band was \"totally into not smoking or doing drugs\".<ref name=tribune/>\n\n===''Bangin\u2019''===\nIn 1987, ''[[Bangin'|Bangin]],''' their second album was released.<ref name=\":0\" />  The album did not achieve the acclaim of ''Play Deep'', but it spawned a top 40 single, \"[[Since You've Been Gone (The Outfield song)|Since You've Been Gone]]\" (not to be confused with the 1970s [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] and [[Head East]] hit of the [[Since You Been Gone|same name]]), which also hit No. 11 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock Songs chart.  Furthermore, the Outfield had a minor radio/MTV hit with \"No Surrender\". The album sold reasonably well and was certified gold in the United States. A U.S. summer tour opening for [[Night Ranger]] followed.\n\n===''Voices of Babylon''===\nFor the group's third album, 1989's ''[[Voices of Babylon]]'', a new producer [[David Kahne]] and sound was adopted.<ref name=\":0\" /> The title track was a top 25 single and was No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock Songs chart. The follow-up song, \"My Paradise\", was a mid-sized album-rock hit reaching No. 34 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock Songs chart, but overall the group's popularity continued to decline.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''Diamond Days''===\nAfter the ''Babylon'' LP, Alan Jackman parted ways with the band and was replaced for a concert tour by Paul Read. Spinks and Lewis continued as a duo, switched labels, and began recording ''[[Diamond Days (The Outfield album)|Diamond Days]]'' for [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] (Music Corporation of America).<ref name=\":0\" /> Playing drums on the disc was session drummer Simon Dawson. The LP, released in 1990, produced a top 30 US hit, \"[[For You (The Outfield song)|For You]]\". Quick to follow was \"One Hot Country\", included on the soundtrack to the 1991 action film ''[[If Looks Could Kill (film)|If Looks Could Kill]]''.\n\n===Later years and aftermath===\nThe Outfield returned with 1992's ''[[Rockeye]]''. Its leadoff single, \"Closer to Me\", was a hit, nearly making the top 40 and a second release, \"Winning It All\", gained some notice due to extensive play during the [[NBA Finals]] on [[NBC]], the ''NBA Superstars'' series featuring [[Larry Bird]], the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], the [[Chicago Bulls]] championship ring ceremonies, and the film ''[[The Mighty Ducks (movies)|The Mighty Ducks]]''. Simon Dawson, who played on ''Rockeye'', eventually became the band's official third member. The band took an extended hiatus during the mid-1990s as changing musical fashions, especially the popularity of edgier bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]], made life difficult for older bands with a less fashionable aesthetic.\n\nThe Outfield returned to their East End roots, often playing low-key gigs at a local [[Pub|public house]], where much of the clientele were unaware that the group had sold millions of records in the US. Unfortunately, the situation was typical of the problems the Outfield had faced in their homeland: little recognition and a much smaller following than they had experienced in the US. Nevertheless, the band reappeared with a fan-club-only release, entitled ''It Ain't Over...'' and resumed touring. Soon thereafter in 1999, they released ''[[Extra Innings (album)|Extra Innings]]'', an odds-and-ends compilation of new and older, unreleased songs.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the band released two live collections via their official website: ''[[Live in Brazil (The Outfield album)|Live in Brazil]]'' and ''[[The Outfield Live]]'' came out. In 2004, the band released ''[[Any Time Now (The Outfield album)|Any Time Now]]'', a new studio album through [[Tower Records]], and later released a new version of the album in March 2006 through Sidewinder Records.\n\nIn 2009, the original lineup of John Spinks, Tony Lewis and Alan Jackman returned to recording in a London studio to record their first album together since ''[[Voices of Babylon]]'' was recorded in 1988. In addition, the Outfield announced that Brent Bitner had taken over the band's management and launched their official Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and [[Myspace]] pages in November 2009.  On 22 March 2011, the Outfield announced their upcoming album would be called ''[[Replay (The Outfield album)|Replay]]''. ''Replay'' was recorded in various studios in the south of England, which included production work at the legendary [[Abbey Road Studios]]. ''Replay'' was produced by the Outfield and Brent Bitner with executive production by John Spinks. On 28 June 2011, ''Replay'' was released to rave reviews. The lead single, \"California Sun\", was a regional number one AOR chart hit and has been the second most added song on AC radio as of 15 August 2011. A limited advanced release of the band's possible second single, \"A Long, Long Time Ago\", reached number one on Worldwide FM ClassX Radio's AOR chart in the second week of August 2011. In 2013, the band rerecorded vocals to their single \"Your Love\" to be incorporated into American DJ [[Morgan Page]]'s reworking of the song, which was released in the summer of that year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Steph|title=Morgan Page \u2013 \"Your Love\" (ft.

It's music by recipe: You take hyper-macho hard rock and tone it down so it will appeal to the over-17 set. You need a simple hook that can be repeated a dozen or so times, lots of electric guitar solos, a standard rock beat and basic lyrics.\"<ref name=\"tbt\"/> Indeed, the Outfield were ''so'' American-sounding (even taking their name from America's [[baseball|national pastime]]), they were much more popular in the U.S. than they were in their homeland. None of their albums made the [[Music of the United Kingdom|UK]] charts, and only three of their singles could scratch their way onto the British singles listings (with \"Voices of Babylon\" peaking at #78).\n\nJohn Spinks said in a 1986 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he was very influenced by \"the music that gives me a rush\" and that he \"grew up on [[the Beatles]]\". Interestingly, it was said that the band wanted to be a \"car stereo sort of poppy version of the band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. \"61 Seconds and \"Mystery Man\" are evidence of this. He cited contemporaries [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], and [[Mr. Mister]]\u2013particularly the latter's hit \"[[Broken Wings (Mr. Mister song)|Broken Wings]]\". In the interview, he expanded on the band's strong foundation in melody:\n\n{{blockquote|I love melodic music. [...] When you look at that music, you have to take it for what it is. I can write a pretty melody. That takes some talent. It may not be complicated and maybe it doesn't challenge anybody, but so what? Some people obviously like it.
