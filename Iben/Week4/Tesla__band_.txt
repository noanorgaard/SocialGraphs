The band adopted the Tesla moniker shortly before recording their first album, as another band with a name similar to City Kidd already existed.\n\nTesla rose to fame during the [[Glam metal|hair metal]] boom of the 1980s.<ref name=\":0\" /> Their debut album, ''[[Mechanical Resonance (album)|Mechanical Resonance]]'', was released in 1986, which produced two hit singles, \"[[Modern Day Cowboy]]\" and their cover of \"[[Little Suzi]]\" (originally by [[Ph.D. (band)|Ph.D.]]). The band's second album, ''[[The Great Radio Controversy]]'' (1989), peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}}{{sp}}18 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and produced the top-ten single \"[[Love Song (Tesla song)|Love Song]]\". The band recorded and released their third album, the live acoustic album ''[[Five Man Acoustical Jam]]'', in 1990. It peaked at No.{{sp}}12 on the ''Billboard 200'' and produced their top-charting single (No.{{sp}}8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), \"[[Signs (Five Man Electrical Band song)|Signs]]\", a cover of a song by the [[Five Man Electrical Band]]. Their third studio album, ''[[Psychotic Supper]]'' (1991), peaked at No.{{sp}}13, but lacked a hit single; similarly their next album, 1994's ''[[Bust a Nut]]'' did well enough on the album charts, peaking at No.{{sp}}20, but also lacked any radio hits. \n\nThe band broke up in 1996, but returned in 2000 with a live tour and album, both named ''[[Replugged Live|Replugged]]''. They have continued to record and tour, though Skeoch left in 2006 and was replaced by Dave Rude on guitars. Their most recent release is the EP ''All About Love'' (2024), while their latest studio album to date is ''[[Shock (Tesla album)|Shock]]'' (2019).

He rejoined after completing rehab, only to depart again months later. The band moved forward as a four-piece for a short while. However, it wasn't long before Skeoch briefly joined up with solo artist Marshall Coleman's band to support his solo career, only to see a departure of Marshall soon after. This band eventually morphed to include Jeff Keith and resurfaced as [[Bar 7]] with a single \"Four Leaf Clover\", from the album ''The World Is a Freak''. Brian Wheat formed Soulmotor and Frank Hannon formed Moon Dog Mane, while Troy Luccketta worked with several local artists including the Bay Area's One Thin Dime.\n\n===Reunion, ''Into the Now'' and ''Real to Reel'' (2000\u20132007)===\nAfter a break of six years, the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' reported that the band had reformed in 2000 with the help of local radio personality Pat Martin of KRXQ. The band played a sold-out show at [[ARCO Arena]] in Sacramento on October 25, 2000. Soon after they recorded the double live album ''[[Replugged Live]]''. In 2002 they were featured in the [[Rock Never Stops Tour]] alongside other 1980s rock bands.\n\n2002 saw the release of a further live album, ''[[Standing Room Only (Tesla album)|Standing Room Only]]'', which is just a single CD version of ''Replugged Live''.\n\nIn 2004, they released their fifth studio album ''[[Into the Now]]'' which debuted on the Billboard album chart at No. 30.

The second CD was also given away with the August edition of [[Classic Rock magazine|''Classic Rock'' magazine]] in Europe.\n\nAt the end of August, Tesla announced their first world tour in 16 years with dates in Australia, Japan, and Europe in October and November 2007.\n\n===''Forever More'' and ''Twisted Wires'' (2008\u20132012)===\n[[File:Tesla Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Tesla at [[Sweden Rock Festival]] 2008]]\nIn June and July 2008, Tesla played a few shows in Europe and the US, including [[Sweden Rock Festival]], [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and [[Rocklahoma]].
