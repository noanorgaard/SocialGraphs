Their early work blended jangly guitar melodies with power-pop sensibilities. The original lineup included Hoffs (guitar and vocals), Vicki Peterson (guitar and vocals), Debbi Peterson (drums and vocals), and [[Annette Zilinskas]] (bass). After Zilinskas left in 1983 to focus on other projects, [[Michael Steele (musician)|Michael Steele]], formerly of [[the Runaways]], joined as bassist and vocalist, cementing the classic lineup.<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bangles-mn0000757085/biography |title=Bangles &#124; Biography & History |website=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\nTheir 1984 debut album, ''[[All Over the Place (The Bangles album)|All Over the Place]]'', received critical acclaim and earned the group a loyal following, setting the stage for their commercial breakthrough with the 1986 album ''[[Different Light]]''. The success of ''Different Light'' established the Bangles as one of the top female-fronted acts of the 1980s. \n\nAfter their third album, ''[[Everything (The Bangles album)|Everything]]'' (1988), and the success of \"Eternal Flame\", the band struggled with internal tensions, and disbanded in 1989.

The impetus was two classified advertisements in the weekly paper ''The Recycler''. One had been placed by Hoffs, and the only person to respond was Annette Zilinskas, and the other was by Lynn Elkind, the Petersons' housemate and a departing member of their then band Those Girls. When Hoffs called in response to Elkind's ad, Vicki Peterson answered the phone, and in their conversation, they discovered a great deal of common interests.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sobczak |first=Gene |date=November 1984 |title=Bangles |pages=12 |work=Hard Times |url=https://archive.org/details/HardTimesNumber4MaywoodNj/page/n11/mode/1up |access-date=May 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen Hoffs spoke to Elkind after Peterson gave her the message, Hoffs and Elkind did not have the same common interests and Hoffs then formed a new band with the Petersons.

In 1983, Faulty Products issued a 12-inch \"remix\" single of \"The Real World\" to radio and media, but another setback came as the label folded. [[I.R.S.
