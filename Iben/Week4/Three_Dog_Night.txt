They initially went by the name Redwood and made some recordings with [[Brian Wilson]] while [[the Beach Boys]] were working on the album ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]''.\n\nRedwood was briefly poised to be one of the first artists signed to the Beach Boys' [[Brother Records]]. According to Beach Boy [[Mike Love]], \"[Brian] had them in the studio for several days, and he was really funny. They didn't meet up to his expectations. ... They'd go in and they wouldn't sing well enough for him. ... but they went off and made billions.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tobler |first1=John |author1-link=John Tobler |title=The Beach Boys |date=1978 |publisher=Chartwell Books |isbn=0890091749 |url=https://archive.org/details/beachboys00tobl/|url-access=registration|page=45}}</ref> Wilson attempted to produce an album for Redwood, but after the recording of three songs, including \"[[Time to Get Alone]]\" and \"[[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|Darlin']]\", this motion was halted by his bandmates, who wanted Brian to focus on the Beach Boys' contractual obligations.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter Ames|last=Carlin|author-link=Peter Ames Carlin|title=Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYyovo_AbqAC|year=2006|publisher=Rodale|isbn=978-1-59486-320-2|page=130}}</ref> According to Negron, due to the commercial failure of ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' and Wilson's waning commitment to his band, \"the other Beach Boys wanted Brian's immense songwriting and producing talents used strictly to enhance their own careers\".<ref name=\"priorelostmasterpiece129\">{{cite book |first=Domenic |last=Priore |title=Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece |year=2007 |pages=127\u2013129}}</ref> Negron later noted that he would have acted similarly had he been in the same position as the Beach Boys.<ref name=\"priorelostmasterpiece129\"/>\n\nShortly after abandoning the Redwood moniker in 1968, the vocalists hired a group of backing musicians \u2013 Ron Morgan on guitar, Floyd Sneed on drums, Joe Schermie from the Cory Wells Blues Band on bass, and Jimmy Greenspoon on keyboards \u2013 and soon took the name Three Dog Night.

New guitarist James \"Smitty\" Smith and drummer Mickey McMeel were recruited, but by 1975, Smith had been replaced by [[Al Ciner]] from [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] and [[The American Breed]], and Ryland by Rufus bassist Dennis Belfield. Mickey McMeel would go on to co-star as \"Turkey\", the drummer of [[Kaptain Kool and the Kongs]], in the children's television series ''[[The Krofft Supershow]]''. Mickey McMeel was replaced on tour by Las Vegas show drummer John Mrowiec. \n\nFor the albums [[Cyan (Three Dog Night album)|''Cyan'']], ''[[Hard Labor]]'', and ''[[Coming Down Your Way]]'', Hutton was absent from many of the recording sessions due to burgeoning cocaine and alcohol abuse (often in conjunction with such friends as Harry Nilsson and Brian Wilson), eventually precipitating his dismissal from the band at the instigation of Wells in late 1975.

The EP failed to sell after Passport went bankrupt. The reunion featured all of the original members, except [[Joe Schermie]], who was succeeded by future [[Rick Springfield]] bassist Mike Seifrit until 1982, and then by Richard Grossman, who was featured on ''It's a Jungle'' and stayed until 1984. Two guitarists, Paul Kingery and Steve Ezzo, occasionally played with the band, filling in for Allsup on dates he was not able to make between 1982 and 1984. Ezzo replaced Allsup when he departed in late 1984 to take care of some personal and family matters. Sneed was let go from the band at the same time. Also in late 1984, keyboardist David Bluefield filled in for Greenspoon, who was ill. But Bluefield was replaced in 1985 by Rick Seratte (formerly of [[Poco (band)|Poco]] and later with [[Whitesnake]] and others) and the band hit the road with a revised lineup that included Seratte, Steve Ezzo, bassist Scott Manzo and drummer Mike Keeley.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The band toured all through 1985, but Seratte left to pursue other offers and Greenspoon rejoined the band with Negron in late 1985 and were both back touring with the group.\n\nBy December 1985, after a relapse into his drug habit, Negron was let go, and the group continued with Wells and Hutton fronting the band and Paul Kingery was brought back on guitar to cover Chuck's vocal harmonies. In 1986, their song \"In My Heart\" was featured in ''[[Robotech: The Movie]]''.\n\nMore changes in personnel occurred when guitarist T. J. Parker and vocalist and bassist Gary Moon replaced Kingery and Manzo in 1988, and were replaced themselves by Mike Cuneo and [[Richard Campbell (American musician)|Richard Campbell]] during 1989.\n\nAllsup returned to the group to replace Cuneo in the spring of 1991. Negron entered drug rehab, but did not return to the band.\n\nPat Bautz succeeded Keeley as drummer in 1993.\n\nIn 1993, Three Dog Night performed for [[History of Freeform|The Family Channel]] show ''Spotlight on Country'', filmed in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Kingery returned to the band as their bass player in 1996 following Campbell's departure.\n\n===2000\u20132012===\nOriginal bassist Joe Schermie died on March 26, 2002.

They also released a DVD of a filmed symphony performance from 2000 titled ''Three Dog Night Live With the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra'' in May 2002.  In the summer of 2004, 80s bassist Scott Manzo returned briefly to fill in for Paul Kingery.\n\nIn October 2004, Three Dog Night released ''The 35th Anniversary Hits Collection Featuring The London Symphony Orchestra''. The album includes the two previously released new songs plus live versions of \"Eli's Coming\", \"Brickyard Blues\", \"Try a Little Tenderness\", and \"Family of Man\".
