Its most prominent line-up consisted of Roberts, [[Ellen Reid]] (co-vocals, keyboards), Brad's brother Dan Roberts (bass guitar, backing vocals), [[Son of Dave|Benjamin Darvill]] (harmonica, mandolin), and [[Mitch Dorge]] (drums, percussion). \n\nThe band is widely known internationally for their 1993 single \"[[Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm]]\" and in Canada for the 1991 single \"[[Superman's Song]]\".\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings: 1988\u20131991===\nThe origin of Crash Test Dummies is tied to the history of two [[Winnipeg]] nightspots, the Spectrum Cabaret and the Blue Note Cafe, owned by Curtis Riddell.<ref>\"Dummies crash head-on into big time\". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', November 29, 1991.</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Riddell joined with [[Brad Roberts]] to form the decidedly less-than-serious bar band Bad Brad Roberts and the St. James Rhythm Pigs. Over time, the band evolved into Crash Test Dummies, a name suggested by a friend of the band who was in medical school. The diagnostic mannequin, known colloquially as a [[crash test dummy]], was known to the public already by this time. The band adopted the name as a joke,<ref>{{cite news|title=Curse of the Crash Test Dummy|newspaper=[[The Gateway (student magazine)|The Gateaway]]|url=https://archive.org/details/GAT_1991092401/page/10/mode/2up|date=24 September 1991}}</ref> but nevertheless kept it. [[Ellen Reid]] and [[Son of Dave|Benjamin Darvill]] became permanent additions. George West, the original bass player, quit and was replaced by Dan Roberts, Brad's brother. Riddell was replaced by Vince Lambert, who was replaced by [[Mitch Dorge]] just before the release of ''[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]''.\n\nAfter signing with BMG Records in 1991,<ref name=\"Inc.1999\">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Dummies Hand In their Latest Set|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQ4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21|date=27 February 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=18\u201321|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> the band signed with manager Jeff Rogers (Swell) who managed the band until the end of 1999 when he left to become Head of Artist Development at Richard Branson's V2 Records.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://cmw.net/speakers/jeff-rogers/ | title=Jeff Rogers|website=Cmw.net}}</ref>\n\n===Mainstream success: 1991\u20131999===\nThe band first began to achieve commercial success in Canada with the release of ''[[The Ghosts that Haunt Me]]'' in 1991.<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=103}}</ref> The album eventually reached sales of 400,000 in Canada, largely due to the popularity of the hit single \"[[Superman's Song]]\", which appeared on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] Top Singles chart that year,<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=1086& \"Top Singles\"]..

''Drowned in Sound'', by Colin Weston, January 7, 2001</ref> Particularly instrumental in increasing the band's exposure in the American market was the appearance of a new type of radio format, [[Adult album alternative|adult album-oriented alternative rock]] (AAA). These stations put the first single, \"[[Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm]]\", in high rotation and the song peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the US Hot 100. \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\" did even better in the United Kingdom, where it was a No.&nbsp;2 hit, and Australia where it peaked at No.&nbsp;1. Popular parodist [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] parodied the song under the title \"[[Headline News (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic song)|Headline News]]\" in 1994.\n\nIn their native Canada, \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\" was a comparative disappointment on the charts, only peaking at No.&nbsp;14. Two other songs from the album went top 10 in Canada: \"Swimming In Your Ocean\" and \"[[Afternoons & Coffeespoons]]\". This latter song was also a top 40 hit in Australia and the United Kingdom and hit the lower portion of the US Hot 100. The result was that by mid-1994 the album had passed the platinum sales mark (one million) in the United States and had also earned the band three [[Grammy]] nominations and three more [[Juno Awards|Juno]] nominations. To date,{{when|date=July 2022}} ''[[God Shuffled His Feet]]'' has sold more than five and a half million copies worldwide.\n\nIn January 1995, the band released \"[[The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead]]\" (a cover of [[XTC]]'s 1992 track) as a single and on the soundtrack of the [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Jeff Daniels]] comedy ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''. The single, credited to \"The Crash Test Dummies and Ellen Reid\", charted at No.&nbsp;30 in the UK singles chart and was a No.&nbsp;4 hit in Canada.\n\nIn 1996, the Dummies' third album, ''[[A Worm's Life]]'', was released to mixed critical and moderate commercial success.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The guitar-heavy singles were warmly received in some markets. Lead single \"[[He Liked to Feel It]]\" hit No. 2 in Canada, becoming the band's highest-charting single in their home country, but internationally nothing matched the runaway success of either \"Superman's Song\" or \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". Regardless, the album went platinum in Canada in less than one month. \n\n''[[Give Yourself A Hand]]'', the Dummies' fourth album, was released March 23, 1999. The album was recorded in Nassau, Bahamas, at Compass Point Studios and produced by Greg Wells. It showcased a new sound for the Dummies, as it featured Ellen Reid singing lead vocals on three tracks, and Brad Roberts singing in a falsetto on several others. The whole sound of the album was much more electronic than the previous recordings. Once again, the lead single (\"Keep A Lid On Things\") was a top 10 hit in Canada.\n\nDuring a hiatus between albums, [[Benjamin Darvill]] became the first Dummy to release solo material. Under the name [[Son Of Dave]], Darvill first brought out the album ''[[B. Darvill's Wild West Show]]'', followed with ''[[O1 (Son of Dave album)|O1]]'', both released on his own label, Husky Records.<ref name=\"OfficialSite\">{{cite web |url= http://www.crashtestdummies.com/faq/index.html |title= Crash Test Dummies FAQ |publisher= Crash Test Dummies |access-date= 17 March 2010 |date= July 2006 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100808192340/http://www.crashtestdummies.com/faq/index.html |archive-date= 8 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Post-mainstream career: 2000\u20132006===\nThe less-than-stellar commercial success of both ''A Worm's Life'' and ''Give Yourself a Hand'' resulted in the band feeling much more restricted by their label [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], especially after the label rejected 35 songs during the production of ''Give Yourself a Hand''.  As a result, the band and the label parted ways, and Brad Roberts formed his own independent label \"Cha-Ching Records\" (later renamed to \"Deep Fried Records\").<ref name=\"PhillyistCTD\">{{cite web\n| url = http://phillyist.com/2010/05/11/phillyist_interviews_brad_roberts_o.php\n| title = Phillyist Interviews...

After suffering a near-fatal car accident in the fall of 2000, Brad found himself recuperating in the town of [[Argyle, Nova Scotia]]. It was there that he met some local \"lobster fishermen\" who happened to be quite musically inclined \u2013 Kent Greene, Dave Morton, and Danny MacKenzie. Together, they recorded the bulk of ''[[I Don't Care That You Don't Mind]]'', which was to have been Brad's first solo album. Later on, Ellen was brought in to record backing vocals for a few tunes, and Dan agreed to tour with Brad.  When Ellen and Mitch agreed to tour as well, the Crash Test Dummies name was put on the record.  This album saw the Dummies returning to their acoustic roots. Brad compared this album to the Dummies' first, ''[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]'', though he calls it more atmospheric and polished.\n\nNear the end of 2001, some new Dummies solo albums were released. First, Ellen Reid launched her debut solo effort, ''[[Cinderellen]]''.\n\nSoon after, Brad Roberts' long-awaited double-live CD and rockumentary, entitled ''[[Crash Test Dude]]'', were made available through [[MapleMusic Recordings|MapleMusic]].\n\n[[Mitch Dorge]]'s surprise debut album, ''[[As Trees Walking]]'', was released in early 2002. He played almost all of the instruments, took some of the photos for the liner notes, and won a Prairie Music Award for Best Instrumental Recording.\n\nBrad, Dan, and Ellen returned as Crash Test Dummies at the end of 2002 with ''[[Jingle All the Way (Crash Test Dummies album)|Jingle All the Way]]'', a long-rumoured Christmas album.\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Puss 'n' Boots (album)|Puss 'n' Boots]]'' was released. Much like ''I Don't Care'', the album began life as a Brad Roberts solo project. Co-written by [[Stuart Cameron (Musician)|Stuart Cameron]], 13 songs were selected from a pool of 30. Ellen sang backing vocals and Dan played bass, though much of the music \u2013 funky grooves that would not have seemed out of place on ''Give Yourself A Hand'' \u2013 was performed by other musicians.\n\n''[[Songs of the Unforgiven]]'', the eighth studio album under the Crash Test Dummies name, was recorded not long after ''Puss 'n' Boots''.<ref name=\"OfficialSite\"/>\n\n=== Hiatus, ''Oooh La La'' 2006\u20132014 ===\nAfter releasing three records through his own label, Roberts realized he was losing money. As such, he stopped recording and touring and instead worked as a songwriting teacher in New York City, while participating in yoga, chanting, and meditation (the latter influencing Roberts's side-project [[Satsang Circus]]).<ref name=\"CTDRoadAgain\">{{cite web\n|url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/C/Crash_Test_Dummies/2010/05/10/13894016.html\n|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130120201251/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/C/Crash_Test_Dummies/2010/05/10/13894016.html\n|url-status= usurped\n|archive-date= January 20, 2013\n|title= 'Dummies' singer on the road again\n|year= 2010\n|work= Jam!

These styles include the acoustic [[folk rock]] of ''[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]'', the electric [[alternative rock]] of ''[[A Worm's Life]]'', the [[Urban contemporary|urban]] influences of ''[[Give Yourself a Hand]]'', and the [[optigan]]-based compositions of ''[[Oooh La La!

At this time, the most notable instrumentation of the band's music included Brad Roberts' lead guitar, Ellen Reid's keyboards, and Benjamin Darvill's harmonica. Another notable element of Crash Test Dummies' music are the contrasting harmonies between Brad Roberts' deep lead vocals and Ellen Reid's backing vocals in the higher register.\n\nBeginning with ''[[I Don't Care That You Don't Mind]]'' in 2001, the band's albums were recorded primarily by Brad Roberts, Ellen Reid, and a rotating roster of session musicians.\n\n=== Influences ===\nOne of the
