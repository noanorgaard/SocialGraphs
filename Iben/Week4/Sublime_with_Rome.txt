The estate of late Sublime frontman [[Bradley Nowell]] issued a legal challenge to the use of the trademarked name for a venture not including Nowell. As a result, they changed their name to \"Sublime with Rome\" in January 2010.

A little over a month after the EP's release, Ramirez announced that he would be departing the band at the end of 2024 and moving on to focus on his solo career. On February 26, 2024, Eric Wilson announced that he was no longer a member of Sublime with Rome. In March 2024, the band officially announced its farewell tour dates.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Sublime with Rome days (1997\u20132009)===\nIn 1997, Bud Gaugh and Eric Wilson started [[Long Beach Dub Allstars]], their first project since [[Bradley Nowell]]'s death. The band played Sublime songs as well as new material.  After Long Beach Dub Allstars split up in 2002, Wilson went on to form [[Long Beach Shortbus]], while Gaugh went on to form [[Eyes Adrift]] and [[Volcano (supergroup)|Volcano]] (which both featured [[Meat Puppets]] guitarist/vocalist [[Curt Kirkwood]]).\n\nIn February 2009 Gaugh and Wilson reunited for a show in Sparks, Nevada at the Cantina Los Tres Hombres and called themselves Sublime. They were joined by a new singer-guitarist whose identity was not announced; on March 1, 2009, Gaugh confirmed this was then-20-year-old Northern California native [[Rome Ramirez]], who had previously collaborated with Wilson on RAWsession where he played Sublime songs such as \"Saw Red\" and \"Boss DJ\".<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/budgaugh/blog/473896028 Del Mar & Sublime].

The festival also featured performances from [[Kottonmouth Kings]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Deftones]], [[Bad Brains]] and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267549/sublime-to-reunite-for-cypress-hills-smokeout-fest |title=Sublime To Reunite For Cypress Hill's Smokeout Fest |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lawsuit (2009\u20132010)===\nOn October 23, 2009, one day before the Smokeout Festival concert took place, Nowell's family and the executors of his estate threatened Gaugh and Wilson, along with Ramirez, with a lawsuit if the reconstituted band continued to use the Sublime moniker. The statement was posted to the band's official MySpace page and read as follows:\n\n{{cquote|It was recently announced that Sublime bassist Eric Wilson and Sublime drummer Floyd 'Bud' Gaugh are 'reuniting' and teaming with singer and guitarist Rome Ramirez in a band they intend to call 'Sublime.' Prior to his untimely passing, both Bud and Eric acknowledged that Brad Nowell was the sole owner of the name Sublime. It was Brad's expressed intention that no one use the name Sublime in any group that did not include him, and Brad even registered the trademark 'Sublime' under his own name.<br/>\nAs Brad's heirs, and with the support of his entire family, we only want to respect his wishes and therefore have not consented to Bud and Eric calling their new project 'Sublime.' We have always supported Bud and Eric's musical endeavors and their desire to continue to play Sublime's music. We wholeheartedly supported Bud, Eric and the many talented members of the Sublime posse that formed the Long Beach Dub All-Stars, soon after Brad's death, to honor him through their original recordings, live performances and Sublime music until they disbanded in 2001. But, out of respect for Brad's wishes, we have always refused to endorse any group performing as 'Sublime,' and now with great reluctance feel compelled to take the appropriate legal action to protect Brad's legacy.<br/>\nOur hope is that Brad's ex-bandmates will respect his wishes and find a new name to perform under, so as to enhance the 'Sublime' legacy without the confusion and disappointment that many fans have expressed upon seeing the announcement.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266950/sublime-reunion-show-sparks-controversy |title=Sublime Reunion Show Sparks Controversy |magazine=Billboard |date=October 23, 2009 |access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nOn November 3, 2009, a [[Los Angeles]] judge shut down an effort by the new lineup of Sublime to perform under the name. Jeremiah Reynolds, who represents the estate of original Sublime singer Bradley Nowell commented on the case:\n\n:{{cquote|The point we tried to make is that we encourage these gentlemen to go out and play. We think they're great musicians. We just don't think it's appropriate to call a group that doesn't have Bradley [Nowell] and has a new lead singer Sublime. It's consistent with Brad's intentions that we seek to protect the name. The court agreed that Bud and Eric and the new lead singer didn't have the right to go out and call themselves Sublime.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/11/court-injunction-could-halt-sublime-reunion-.html Judge's ruling could put a damper on a Sublime reunion].

A spokesman for Gaugh and Wilson declined to comment. Thomas Brackey, who represents the surviving Sublime members, did not return calls. The injunction is dependent upon a bond of $125,000 being posted in the event it is later determined that the defendants \u2013 the surviving Sublime members \u2013 suffered damages as a result of the ruling. Reynolds said the bond would be posted. Gaugh and Wilson issued the following statement:\n\n{{cquote|Our goal continues to be sharing the music and message of Sublime with all of our fans around the world. We intend to take the court's advice and work on a business solution to this issue. We hope the estate follows suit so the music of Sublime can live on and be accessible to everyone.}}\n\nIn January 2010, the dispute was settled and it was announced that the new lineup of Ramirez, Wilson and Gaugh would perform together under Sublime with Rome.<ref>[http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2010/01/breaking_sublime_lawuit_settle.php BREAKING: Sublime Lawsuit Settled; Showdates Planned] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517100325/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2010/01/breaking_sublime_lawuit_settle.php |date=May 17, 2011 }}.

It'd be great to tour again. But we're taking it a step at a time and as long as each step feels good, then we'll keep on going. One major project under development that we're psyched about is code-named \"Brad's House.\" The idea is to provide free addiction recovery service to underprivileged teens in Brad's honor. The entire Sublime family was devastated by Brad's loss and we would like to help prevent that from happening to others. The band has agreed to allocate proceeds to get this started. We'll begin with one facility but our hope is that we can get other bands and organizations to join us and we can eventually scale it all across the country.<ref>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=505174946&blogId=515364208 A Q&A with Sublime founding member/drummer Bud Gaugh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=February 7, 2009 }}.
