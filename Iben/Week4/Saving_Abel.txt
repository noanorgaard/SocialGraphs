The band is named after the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Cain and Abel]]. Null came up with the name, saying \"I Googled the story of Cain and Abel and found a line about 'there was no saving Abel', which just jumped out at me\".<ref name=\"bandbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.savingabel.us/bio.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012740/http://www.savingabel.us/ |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |title=Biography|publisher=Saving Abel Official website|access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLead guitarist Jason Null and lead singer Jared Weeks formed Saving Abel in [[Corinth, Mississippi]], in 2004. Weeks and Null started writing songs together a few days after they met. Early in 2005, their songs caught the ear of producer Skidd Mills, who brought them into his 747 Studio in Memphis, Tennessee to record some of the songs.<ref name=\"bandbio\"/>\n\nThe band came together with the addition of rhythm guitarist Scott Bartlett, bassist Daniel Dwight, and drummer Blake Dixon. Weeks would throw demo CDs onto the stages of bigger bands that toured through Corinth.<ref name=\"bandbio\"/> After shopping the album around for almost a year and Dwight leaving the group, they recruited bassist Eric Taylor.\n\n\"[[Addicted (Saving Abel song)|Addicted]]\" was first played on Memphis radio station, WMFS, where program director Rob Cressman featured the song in regular rotation based on its strong local appeal. \"Addicted\" was heard by a [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] A&R consultant, who e-mailed the song to CEO of Virgin Music Company Jason Flom. Flom liked it and sent Kim Stephens to watch the band perform in [[Jackson, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"musicrem\">{{cite web |publisher=MusicRemedy |title=Saving Abel to release self-titled |url=http://musicremedy.com/s/saving-abel/album/selftitled-4821.html |first=Jermy|last=Leeuwis|date=December 9, 2008|access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref> \"Addicted\" was released in March 2008 as a single followed by their major label debut, ''[[Saving Abel (album)|Saving Abel]]'', on March 11, 2008. \"Addicted\" rose to No.&nbsp;2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Songs]] chart.
