They are signed to their own [[record label]], Borstal Beat Records.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nPrior to forming Flogging Molly, [[Dublin]]-born Dave King was the lead singer for the heavy metal band [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]] featuring guitarist [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|\"Fast\" Eddie Clarke]] of Mot\u00f6rhead in the early to mid-[[1980s in music|1980s]]. He later fronted a hard rock band called Katmandu (1991), featuring [[Mandy Meyer]] of [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]] and [[Asia (band)|Asia]] on guitars. Afterward, King retained a record deal with [[Epic Records]] and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after.\n\nIn 1993, King met [[violin]] player Bridget Regan, guitarist [[Ted Hutt]], bassist Jeff Peters and drummer [[Paul Crowder]],<ref name=\"floggingmolly.com\">[http://www.floggingmolly.com Life Is Good Out Now]. Floggingmolly.com, Retrieved on March 13, 2020.</ref> and put together a rock band with a [[Celtic music]] influence. They began to play a mix of Irish traditional and rock music. Putting King's poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played weekly at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone's, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as \"Black Friday Rule\" and \"Selfish Man\", which was the beginning of Flogging Molly's sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal. King and Regan began to find new members and the current band was formed.\n\nThey continued a routine of playing every Monday night at Molly Malone's. They put out a live album, ''[[Alive Behind the Green Door]]'', in 1997. In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, King stated that the band's name comes from the bar (Molly Malone's) that faithfully supported the band from the very beginning, \"We used to play there every Monday night and we felt like we were flogging it to death, so we called the band Flogging Molly.\" They were signed onto [[SideOneDummy Records]] after a show when the record company's owners attended a concert and noted their intensity.\n\n===Career===\nThe band\u2019s debut studio album,'' [[Swagger (Flogging Molly album)|Swagger]]'', arrived on March 7, 2000, their first of many with [[SideOneDummy]]. They joined the Vans Warped Tour for the first time that summer alongside [[Green Day]], [[Weezer]], and [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] (whom they continued touring alongside in the fall).<ref name=\"Wikipedia\">{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Warped_Tour_lineups_by_year |title=List of Warped Tour lineups by year |publisher=Wikipedia |access-date=January 25, 2024}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2024}}\n\n''[[Drunken Lullabies]]'' followed on March 19, 2002, and was certified gold by the RIAA in 2009.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=flogging+molly#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA |publisher=RIAA |access-date=January 25, 2024}}</ref> They returned to the Warped Tour in 2003 with a lineup that included [[The All-American Rejects]] and [[Dropkick Murphys]].\n\n''[[Within a Mile of Home]]'', released on September 14, 2004, debuted at No. 20 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''.

It was followed by the 2007 online-only EP, ''[[Complete Control Sessions]]''.\n\nThe group\u2019s fourth studio album, ''[[Float (Flogging Molly album)|Float]]'', debuted at No. 4 on the ''Billboard 200'' in 2008 and produced two well-received singles: \"Requiem for a Dying Song\" (No.&nbsp;35 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts)<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302242/flogging+molly/chart |title=Flogging Molly \u2013 Chart history |publisher=Billboard |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> and the title track (No.&nbsp;40).<ref name=\"billboard\"/>\n\nMarch 2010's ''[[Live at the Greek Theatre (Flogging Molly album)|Live at the Greek Theatre]]'' captured a career-spanning Los Angeles, California performance from the year before as a CD/DVD set.

Lyrics typically touch on subjects such as Ireland and its history, drinking, poverty, politics, love, and death and include several references to the [[Catholic Church]]. \"What's Left of the Flag\" and \"The Likes of You Again\" were written as tributes to King's father, who died when King was a child.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/07/27/warped-tour-oceanport-719/ |title = inTuneMusic Online: Warped Tour @ Oceanport 7/19 |access-date=2009-07-28 |last=Ambrose |first=Anthony |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529174420/http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/07/27/warped-tour-oceanport-719/ |archive-date=2012-05-29 |date=2009-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Current'''\n* [[Dave King (Irish singer)|Dave King]] \u2013 [[lead vocals]], [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[bodhr\u00e1n]], [[banjo]], [[spoons (musical instrument)|spoons]]\n* Bridget Regan \u2013 [[violin]], [[tin whistle]], [[backing vocals|backing and lead vocals]]\n* Dennis Casey \u2013 [[lead guitar|guitar]], [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n* Matt Hensley \u2013 [[accordion]], [[concertina]]\n* Nathen Maxwell \u2013 [[bass guitar]], [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n* Spencer Swain \u2013 [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], guitar, [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n* Mike Alonso \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[percussion]]\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former'''\n* John Donovan \u2013 guitar\n* Tobe McCallum \u2013 mandolin\n* [[Ted Hutt]] \u2013 guitar\n* Jeff Peters \u2013 bass\n* Paul Crowder \u2013 drums\n* Gary Sullivan \u2013 drums\n* George Schwindt \u2013 drums\n* [[Bob Schmidt (musician)|Bob Schmidt]] \u2013 mandolin/banjo, bouzouki, guitar, vocals\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Flogging Molly discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Swagger (Flogging Molly album)|Swagger]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Drunken Lullabies]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Within a Mile of Home]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Float (Flogging Molly album)|Float]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Speed of Darkness]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Life Is Good (Flogging Molly album)|Life Is Good]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[Anthem (Flogging Molly album)|Anthem]]'' (2022)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{Official website}}\n*{{MusicBrainz artist|id=c3694ddc-f7e5-40dd-9fad-90d11a2c50fa|name=Flogging Molly}}\n*[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/band-at-top-of-us-chart-unknown-at-home-1318903.html Interview with Dave King in the Irish Independent]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070314020422/http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=floggingmolly Interview with Bob Schmidt in 2007]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120209140734/http://www.burningstars.net/fm06 Burning Stars Interview with Flogging Molly \u2013 2006]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090906175042/http://www.roxwel.com/player/floggingmollyuncut.html Flogging Molly Music Videos-Interviews-Live Performance] at Roxwel\n\n{{Flogging Molly}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flogging Molly}}\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Celtic punk groups]]\n[[Category:Folk punk groups]]\n[[Category:Irish-American culture]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Punk rock groups from California]]\n[[Category:Rise Records artists]]\n[[Category:SideOneDummy Records artists]]"}}}]}}}}
