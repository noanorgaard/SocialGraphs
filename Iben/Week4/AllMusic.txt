It catalogs more than three million [[album]] entries and 30 million tracks, as well as information on [[Musical artist|musicians]] and [[Musical ensemble|bands]]. Initiated in 1991, the database was first made available on the Internet in 1994.<ref name=\"Wired\" /><ref name=\"Metro\" /> AllMusic is owned by [[RhythmOne]].\n\n==History==\nAllMusic was launched as ''All-Music Guide'' by [[Michael Erlewine]], a \"compulsive archivist, noted astrologer, Buddhist scholar, and musician\". He became interested in using computers for his astrological work in the mid-1970s and founded a software company, Matrix, in 1977. In the early 1990s, as [[compact disc]]s (CDs) replaced [[LP record|LPs]] and [[cassette (format)|cassettes]] as the dominant format for recorded music, Erlewine purchased what he thought was a CD of early recordings by [[Little Richard]]. After buying it, he discovered it was a \"flaccid latter-day rehash\".<ref name=\"Metro\" /> Frustrated with the labeling, he researched using [[metadata]] to create a music guide.<ref name=\"Videoland book\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Daniel |title=Videoland: Movie Culture at the American Video Store |date=January 24, 2014 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles, CA |isbn=978-0520279636 |page=209 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV98AgAAQBAJ&q=All+Music+Guide+Michael+Erlewine+founded+astrologer&pg=PA209 |access-date=July 20, 2017}}</ref> In 1990, in [[Big Rapids, Michigan]], he founded ''All Music Guide'' with a goal to create an open-access database that included every recording \"since [[Enrico Caruso]] gave the industry its first big boost\".<ref name=\"Wired\" />\n\nThe first ''All Music Guide'', published in 1992, was a 1,200-page reference book, packaged with a CD-ROM, titled ''All Music Guide: The Best CDs, Albums & Tapes: The Expert's Guide to the Best Releases from Thousands of Artists in All Types of Music''.<ref name=\"AllMusic1stEdition\">{{cite book | last1=Erlewine | first1=Michael | last2=Bultman | first2=Scott | title=All Music Guide: The Best Cds, Albums & Tapes : The Experts' Guide to the Best Releases from Thousands of Artists in All Types of Music | publisher=Backbeat Books | date=1992 | isbn=978-0-87930-264-1 | oclc=27307106 }}</ref> Its first online version, in 1994, was a text-based [[Gopher (protocol) |Gopher]] site.<ref name=\"Wired\" /><ref name=\"Vice history\">{{cite news |last1=Nosowitz |first1=Dan |title=The Story of AllMusic, Which Predates the World Wide Web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-internets-most-complete-guide-to-music/ |access-date=June 22, 2017 |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> It moved to the [[World Wide Web]] as [[web browser]]s became more user-friendly.<ref name=\"Metro\" />\n\nErlewine hired a database engineer, [[Vladimir Bogdanov (editor)|Vladimir Bogdanov]], to design the ''All Music Guide'' framework, and recruited his nephew, writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], to develop editorial content. In 1993, Chris Woodstra joined the staff as an engineer. A \"record geek\" who had written for alternative weeklies and fanzines, his main qualification was an \"encyclopedic knowledge of music\".<ref name=\"Metro\" /> Allmusic developed a list of 1,400 subgenres of music, a feature that became central to the site's utility. In a 2016 article in ''Tedium'', Ernie Smith wrote: \"AllMusic may have been one of the most ambitious sites of the early-internet era\u2014and it's one that is fundamental to our understanding of pop culture. Because the thing is, it doesn't just track reviews or albums. It tracks styles, genres, and subgenres, along with the tone of the music and the platforms on which the music is sold. It then connects that data together, in a way that can intelligently tell you about an entire type of music, whether a massive genre like classical, or a tiny one like [[sadcore]].\"<ref name=\"big data smith\">{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Ernie |title=The Big Data Jukebox |url=https://tedium.co/2016/09/20/allmusic-database-historic-importance/ |website=tedium.com |publisher=Tedium |access-date=July 26, 2017 |date=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, seeking to further develop its web-based businesses, Alliance Entertainment Corp. bought All Music from Erlewine for a reported $3.5 million.
