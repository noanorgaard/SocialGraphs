Established in the aftermath of Blackmore's first departure from [[Deep Purple]], they originally featured four members of the American rock band [[Elf (band)|Elf]], including their singer [[Ronnie James Dio]], but after their [[Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow|self-titled debut album]], Blackmore fired these members, except Dio, recruiting drummer [[Cozy Powell]], bassist [[Jimmy Bain]], and keyboardist [[Tony Carey]]. This line-up recorded the band's second album ''[[Rising (Rainbow album)|Rising]]'' (1976), while ''[[Long Live Rock 'n' Roll]]'' (1978) saw [[Bob Daisley]] and [[David Stone (keyboardist)|David Stone]] replace Bain and Carey, respectively. ''Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'' was also the last album with Dio before he left the band to join [[Black Sabbath]] in 1979.\n\nRainbow's early work primarily used mystical lyrics with a [[hard rock]]/[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] style, then went in a more pop-rock oriented direction following Dio's departure from the group.<ref name=\"Eduardo Rivadavia\"/> In 1979, Blackmore and Powell revamped the group, recruiting three new members\u2014singer [[Graham Bonnet]], keyboardist [[Don Airey]] and another then-former [[Deep Purple]] member, bassist [[Roger Glover]]\u2014and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single \"[[Since You Been Gone]]\" from their fourth studio album ''[[Down to Earth (Rainbow album)|Down to Earth]]''. With [[Joe Lynn Turner]], who replaced Bonnet in 1980, Rainbow recorded three more albums\u2014''[[Difficult to Cure]]'' (1981), ''[[Straight Between the Eyes]]'' (1982) and ''[[Bent Out of Shape]]'' (1983)\u2014that had commercial success similar to the band's previous albums. Other members of the band during this period were drummers [[Bobby Rondinelli]] and [[Chuck Burgi]] and keyboardist [[David Rosenthal (musician)|David Rosenthal]]. The band split in 1984, when Blackmore and Glover re-joined Deep Purple. \n\nIn 1993, after quitting Deep Purple for good, Blackmore reformed Rainbow with a new line-up, fronted by [[Doogie White]], which recorded their eighth studio album ''[[Stranger in Us All]]'' (1995). \nIn 1997, Blackmore broke up the band again to start fresh with [[Blackmore's Night]], a collaboration between him and his wife [[Candice Night]] on vocals.\n\nBlackmore revived the band once again in 2016,<ref name=ClassicRock1>{{cite web|title=Blackmore's touring lineup revealed|url=http://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2015-11-06/blackmore-s-touring-lineup-revealed|website=ClassicRock|date=6 November 2015|publisher=TeamRock|access-date=6 November 2015}}</ref> and they performed tours in Europe over the next years. \n\nRainbow thought about continuing to play live but those plans were scrapped due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], leaving the band on hiatus since their last tour in 2019.\n\nOver the years Rainbow went through many personnel changes, with each studio album recorded with a different line-up, leaving Blackmore as the band's only constant member.

However, the new members were keen to add their own musical influences into the band's sound, some of which were not to Blackmore's taste.

The centrepiece of the band's live performance was a computer-controlled rainbow including 3,000 lightbulbs, which stretched 40 feet across the stage.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=195\u2013196}}{{Sfn|Bloom|2007|p=190}} In 1976, the band's name was shortened to Rainbow, and a second album, ''[[Rising (Rainbow album)|Rising]]'', was recorded in February at Musicland. The band added Deep Purple's \"[[Mistreated (song)|Mistreated]]\" to their setlist, and song lengths were stretched to include improvisation, as displayed on the live album ''[[On Stage (Rainbow album)|On Stage]]'', released in the summer of 1977.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=196}} Carey recalls rehearsing the material was fairly straightforward, saying \"We didn't work anything out, except the structure, the ending ... very free-form, really progressive rock.\"{{sfn|Bloom|2007|p=194}} The album art was designed by American fantasy artist [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]], who had drawn [[Tarzan]] and [[Conan the Barbarian]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=Mark Voger |title=Criss eager to meet television idol Zacherley |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |page=6E |date=22 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Manowar truck to make its debut in Austria this weekend |work=Austria Today |date=8 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1976, following a gig at Newcastle City Hall, Blackmore decided to fire Carey, believing his playing style to be too complicated for the band. Unable to find a suitable replacement on such short notice, Carey was quickly reinstated,{{sfn|Bloom|2007|p=201-202}} but as the world tour progressed on to Japan, he found himself regularly being the recipient of Blackmore's pranks and humour.{{sfn|Bloom|2007|p=203}} Blackmore subsequently decided that Bain was substandard and fired him in January 1977. Carey quit the band shortly after, after getting tired of Blackmore's pranks. Blackmore, however, had difficulty finding replacements he liked. On keyboards, after auditioning several high-profile artists, including [[Vanilla Fudge]]'s [[Mark Stein (musician)|Mark Stein]], [[Procol Harum]]'s [[Matthew Fisher (musician)|Matthew Fisher]] and ex-[[Curved Air]] and [[Roxy Music]] man [[Eddie Jobson]], Blackmore finally selected Canadian [[David Stone (keyboardist)|David Stone]], from the little-known band Symphonic Slam. For a bass player, Blackmore initially chose [[Mark Clarke (musician)|Mark Clarke]], formerly of [[Jon Hiseman]]'s [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]] and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], but once in the studio for the next album, ''[[Long Live Rock 'n' Roll]]'', Blackmore disliked Clarke's fingerstyle method of playing so much that he fired him on the spot{{sfn|Dio|Wall|2021|p=151}} and played bass himself on all but three songs: \"Gates of Babylon\", \"Kill the King\", and \"Sensitive to Light\". Former [[Widowmaker (British band)|Widowmaker]] bassist [[Bob Daisley]] was hired to finish the album, completing the band's next line-up.\n\nAfter the release of ''Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'' and its extensive world tour in 1978, Blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new, more mainstream direction, away from the \"sword and sorcery\" themes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Roy |title = Rainbow Rising: The Story of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |year=2002}}</ref> Dio did not agree with this change and left the band.\n\nIn a 1979 interview with [[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]],<ref>Sounds, 15 December 1979</ref> Blackmore said:\n<blockquote>\n{{ubl|\"If they were good enough, they'd still be in the band. I'm not putting down the other members who were in the band, but no-one has ever left Rainbow. It's a fact. Not a confrontation just, well you didn't quite make it, you'll have to do other things.\"|\"Ronnie is a very good singer- I still like him -but he was becoming very lackadaisical. I'm sure if he were here now he would argue the point, but the fact is, Ronnie was not contributing what he should have done, and he knows that. For the last two years I would put down the riff, the progressions, give him the basic melody and he would write the lyrics. I found that in the past year he wasn't really doing that. He was bitching about the fact that it was Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. And I'm going, look, I've tried after three years to make it just Rainbow, not my Rainbow.\"|\"When people leave the band we don't give too many reasons because we don't want to hinder their career. But if someone's not pulling their weight then I will not put up with someone who's second rate. I'm not going to jump onstage and say 'it's alright ladies and gentlemen, I know they're not very good but they are my friends' like most bands do.\"|\"A couple of people in the band were taking quite a few drugs and consequently were falling asleep while they were playing because they'd been partying all night. I gave them the sack. It's incredible how those people react.

In 1980, the band headlined the inaugural [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Castle Donington]] in England. However, this was Powell's last Rainbow gig: he had already given his notice to quit, disliking Blackmore's increasingly [[pop rock]] direction. Then, after numerous fallouts with Blackmore, Bonnet resigned to pursue a solo project.\n\nFor the next album, Bonnet and Powell were replaced by Americans [[Joe Lynn Turner]] and [[Bobby Rondinelli]], respectively. The title track from ''[[Difficult to Cure]]'' was a version of [[Symphony No.&nbsp;9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]]. The album spawned their most successful UK single, \"[[I Surrender (Rainbow song)|I Surrender]]\" (another Ballard song), which reached No.3. After the supporting tour, Don Airey quit over musical differences and was replaced by [[David Rosenthal (musician)|David Rosenthal]].\n\nThe band attained significant airplay on [[Album-oriented rock]] radio stations in the US with the track \"[[Jealous Lover]]\", reaching No.&nbsp;13 on [[Billboard Magazine]]'s [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Rock Tracks]] chart. Originally issued as the B-side to \"Can't Happen Here\", \"Jealous Lover\" subsequently became the title track to an EP issued in the US that featured similar cover art to ''Difficult to Cure''.\n\nRainbow's next full-length studio album was ''[[Straight Between the Eyes]]''. The album was more cohesive than ''Difficult to Cure'', and had more success in the United States. The band, however, was alienating some of its earlier fans with its more AOR sound.<ref name=\"Eduardo Rivadavia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rainbow-mn0000391933/biography |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |title=Rainbow |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=10 July 2010}}</ref> The single \"Stone Cold\" was a ballad that had some chart success (No. 1 on ''Billboard'' Magazine's Rock Tracks chart) and its video received heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. The successful supporting tour skipped the UK completely and focused on the American market. A date in [[San Antonio, Texas]] on this tour was filmed, and the resulting ''Live Between the Eyes'' also received repeated showings on MTV, and was released on home video.\n\n''[[Bent Out of Shape]]'' saw drummer Rondinelli fired in favour of former [[Brand X]] and [[Balance (band)|Balance]] drummer [[Chuck Burgi]].

By April 1984, Blackmore and Glover had committed to the reunion, and Rainbow was disbanded. A then-final Rainbow album, ''[[Finyl Vinyl]]'', was released in 1986. A double live album covering the band's whole history, it also includes three stray studio B-sides, \"Weiss Heim\" (\"All Night Long\" B-side), \"Bad Girl\" (\"Since You Been Gone\" B-side), and \"Jealous Lover\" (\"Can't Happen Here\" B-side).\n\nIn 1988, after joining the band [[Impelliteri]], Graham Bonnet covered \"Since You Been Gone\" on the group's debut album, ''[[Stand In Line]]''.\n\nIn 1993, Blackmore left Deep Purple again due to \"creative differences\" with other members, and reformed Rainbow with all-new members featuring Scottish singer [[Doogie White]]. The band released ''[[Stranger in Us All]]'' in 1995, and embarked on a lengthy world tour.\n\nThe tour proved successful, and the show in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany, was professionally filmed for the ''[[Rockpalast]]'' TV show. This show, initially heavily bootlegged (and considered by many collectors to be the best Rainbow bootleg of the era), was officially released by [[Eagle Records]] on CD and DVD as ''Black Masquerade'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00DBNWAZ6/ |title=Black Masquerade by Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow |website=Amazon.co.uk |access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> The live shows featured frequent changes in set lists, and musical improvisations that proved popular with bootleggers and many shows are still traded over a decade later.\n\nHowever, Blackmore turned his attention to his long-time musical passion, Renaissance and medieval music. Rainbow was put on hold once again after playing its final concert in Esbjerg, Denmark in 1997. Blackmore, together with his partner [[Candice Night]] as vocalist then formed the Renaissance-influenced [[Blackmore's Night]]. Around the same time as production of ''Stranger in Us All'' (1995), they were already gearing up their debut album ''[[Shadow of the Moon]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web |title=Stranger in Us All |publisher=allmusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r347818 |first=Bret |last=Adams |date=26 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Split (1997\u20132014)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nMany Rainbow songs have been performed live by former members of the band since the group's split in 1984 and then in 1997, particularly former frontmen [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Graham Bonnet]], [[Joe Lynn Turner]] and [[Doogie White]] in recent years. Also, [[Don Airey]] often plays 1979\u20131981 era songs during his solo shows. [[Blackmore's Night]] occasionally performs one or two Rainbow songs live, namely \"Ariel\", \"Rainbow Eyes\", \"Street of Dreams\" and \"Temple of the King\". The latter three were also re-recorded by Blackmore's Night in studio.\n\nIn 2002\u20132004, the [[Hughes Turner Project]] played a number of Rainbow songs at their concerts. On 9 August 2007, [[Joe Lynn Turner]] and Graham Bonnet played a tribute to Rainbow show in Helsinki, Finland. The concert consisted of songs from the 1979\u20131983 era.\n\nIn 2009, Joe Lynn Turner, Bobby Rondinelli, Greg Smith and Tony Carey created the touring tribute band [[Over the Rainbow (band)|Over the Rainbow]] with J\u00fcrgen Blackmore (Ritchie's son) as the guitarist. Over the Rainbow performed songs from every era of the band's history. After the first tour, Tony Carey had to leave the band due to health concerns; he was replaced by another former Rainbow member, Paul Morris. Plans for the band to record original material were scrapped and Over the Rainbow was formally disbanded in 2011.\n\n===Revival (2015\u2013present)===\n[[File:Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow headlining the Stone Free 2017 Festival at the O2 (35341404416).jpg|thumb|250px|Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow performing at the Stone Free Festival 2017]]\n\nIn 2015, Blackmore announced that he would play \"all rock\" concerts in the summer of 2016 under the banner \"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\", his first rock shows since 1997.

It kicked off with the band's first show in London since 1995 at the second annual Stone Free Festival at [[The O2 Arena|The O2]], followed by shows in Manchester, Glasgow and Birmingham; the Manchester show was cancelled following the [[Manchester Arena bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow Announces U.K. Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ritchie-blackmore-rainbow-announces-u-k-tour/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=6 December 2016|access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nRainbow released another live album and DVD, ''Memories in Rock II'' in 2018, which chronicles a live show in Germany. The final track on the album, \"Waiting for a Sign\", is a studio track recorded with the current band line-up, and marked Rainbow's first song in 23 years. The band played five dates in April 2018, at [[Moscow]], [[St Petersburg]], [[Helsinki]], [[Berlin]], and [[Prague]]. The shows were well-attended, with Helsinki a sell-out. The set-list again varied from night-to-night, with an almost 50/50 selection of Rainbow and Deep Purple songs. Rainbow released another single, \"The Storm\", in May 2019, which was \"a rocked-up remake\" of [[Blackmore's Night]]'s 2001 song with the same title,<ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\">{{cite web|title=RITCHIE BLACKMORE's RAINBOW: Pro-Shot Video Of 'Burn' Performance From Spain's ROCK THE COAST Festival|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/ritchie-blackmores-rainbow-pro-shot-video-of-burn-performance-from-spains-rock-the-coast-festival/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=22 July 2019|access-date=19 April 2022}}</ref> and the band resumed touring in Europe that summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=RITCHIE BLACKMORE's RAINBOW Releases 'The Storm' Single (Audio)|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/ritchie-blackmores-rainbow-releases-the-storm-single-audio/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=17 May 2019|access-date=19 April 2022}}</ref><ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\"/>\n\nThe future of Rainbow has been uncertain since wrapping up their 2019 European tour. When asked in November 2020 about the current status of the band, Romero said, \"Obviously, nothing's gonna happen next year. And Ritchie and Candice, they're really focused on the [[Nature's Light|new Blackmore's Night record]]. So probably if everything comes back to normality in the next few years, probably we'll do some more shows.

And now it's like everything is getting back to normal but delayed two years. So there is a lot of shows happening. And until it gets completely back to normal, it's gonna happen at least a couple of years. So I think Ritchie is not too much into the idea to make anything so far.
