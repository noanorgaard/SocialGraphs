Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].\n\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", which topped the [[UK singles chart]] for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", which have become [[Stadium anthem|anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" from ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'' (1980) became their best-selling single, and their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and has been certified [[RIAA certification|9\u00d7 Platinum]] in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Knebworth Festival|Knebworth]], England.\n\nMercury was diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] in 1987. The band released two more albums, ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' in 1989 and ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' in 1991. On 23 November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed his AIDS diagnosis, and the next day died of [[bronchopneumonia]], a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocals, 1995's ''[[Made in Heaven]]''. Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as \"Queen +\", with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] until 2009 and [[Adam Lambert]] since 2011.\n\nQueen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250&nbsp;million to 300&nbsp;million, making them one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. In 1990, Queen received the [[Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music|Outstanding Contribution to British Music]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2005, they received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2018, they were presented the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], and they were awarded the [[Polar Music Prize]] in 2025.\n\n==History==\n\n===1968\u20131971: Foundations===\nThe founding members of Queen met in west London during the late 1960s. Guitarist [[Brian May]] had built [[Red Special|his own guitar]] with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|Orwell's novel]]) the following year with singer [[Tim Staffell]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=30,32\u201333}} May left the group in early 1968 to focus on his degree in Physics and Infrared Astronomy at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and find a group that could write original material.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=37,44,64}} He formed the group [[Smile (band)|Smile]] with Staffell (now playing bass) and keyboardist Chris Smith.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=59}} To complete the line-up, May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a \"[[Mitch Mitchell]]/[[Ginger Baker]] type\" drummer; [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], a young dental student, auditioned and got the job.{{sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=118}} Smith left the group in early 1969, immediately before a gig at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Free (band)|Free]] and the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=62}}\n\n[[File:Queen @ Imperial College campus - 1970.jpg|thumb|left|Queen in 1970.

He asked if he could join the group as lead singer, but May felt Staffell would not give up that role.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=65}} He also ran a stall in [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]] with Taylor.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=7}}\n\n[[File:Queen First Public Performance Here 18 July 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PRS for Music]] heritage award at [[Prince Consort Road]] commemorating Queen's first performance in London]]\nIn 1970, Staffell quit Smile, feeling his interests in [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] clashed with the group's hard rock sound and being fed up with the lack of success. He formed the group [[Humpy Bong]] with former [[Bee Gees]] drummer [[Colin Petersen]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=92\u201393}} The remaining members accepted Bulsara as lead singer, and recruited Taylor's friend [[Mike Grose]] as bassist. The four played their first gig at a fundraising event in [[Truro]] on 27 June 1970.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=95}} Bulsara suggested the group should be renamed to \"Queen\". The others were uncertain at first, but he said, \"it's wonderful, dear, people will love it\".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=95}} At the same time, he decided to [[Name change#United Kingdom|change his surname]] to Mercury, inspired by the line \"Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me\" in the song \"[[Queen (Queen album)#\"My Fairy King\"|My Fairy King]]\".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=96}} The group played their first London gig on 18 July.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21669973 |title=Heritage award to mark Queen's first gig |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=5 March 2013 |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326015501/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21669973 |url-status=live }}</ref> The early set consisted of material that later appeared on the first two albums, along with various rock and roll covers, such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[the Shadows]]' \"[[Please Don't Tease]]\". They attracted the attention of producer [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]], who was interested in the group's sound but thought they had the wrong bass player.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=96}} After three live gigs, Mike Grose decided not to continue with the band and was replaced by [[Barry Mitchell (musician)|Barry Mitchell]] (ex [[Crushed Butler]]). Mitchell played thirteen gigs with Queen between August 1970 and January 1971.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=97}} In turn, Mitchell left in January 1971 and was replaced by [[Doug Bogie]] for two live gigs.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=102,105}}\n\n===1971\u20131974: ''Queen'' and ''Queen II''===\nIn February 1971, [[John Deacon]] joined Queen. In addition to being an experienced bassist, his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=107}} On 2 July, Queen played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2009|p=26}} May called Terry Yeadon, an engineer at Pye Studios where Smile had recorded, to see if he knew anywhere where Queen could go. Yeadon had since moved to [[De Lane Lea Studios]]' new premises in [[Wembley]], and they needed a group to test out the equipment and recording rooms. He tried asking [[the Kinks]] but couldn't get hold of them. Therefore, he told Queen they could record some demos in exchange for the studio's acoustic tests.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=112\u2013113}} They recorded five of their own songs, \"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", \"[[Queen (Queen album)#\"Great King Rat\"|Great King Rat]]\", \"[[Queen (Queen album)#\"The Night Comes Down\"|The Night Comes Down]]\" and \"[[Queen (Queen album)#\"Jesus\"|Jesus]]\". During the recording, producers John Anthony and [[Roy Thomas Baker]] visited the band. The two were taken with \"Keep Yourself Alive\" and began promoting the band to several record companies.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=114}}\n\n[[File:The Cavern Club, exhibited signed guitars for memorable performances - The Rolling Stones (5th November 1963) - Crescent Stratocaster, Queen (31st October 1970) - Squier Stratocaster (2016-09-04 20.44.17 by NH53).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen guitar (right, next to a Rolling Stones guitar) at the [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]] in Liverpool, marking a 31 October 1970 Queen concert at the venue]]\nPromoter Ken Testi managed to attract the interest of [[Charisma Records]], who offered Queen an advance of around \u00a325,000, but the group turned them down as they realised the label would promote [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] as a priority. Testi then entered discussions with [[Trident Studios]]' [[Norman Sheffield]], who offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use their facilities, while the management searched for a deal. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by signed musicians.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=117\u2013118}} Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as \"gold dust\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s76l4|title=Queen: From Rags to Rhapsody \u2013 BBC Four|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=9 May 2018|archive-date=7 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207023709/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s76l4|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nQueen began 1972 with a gig at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], London where only six people turned up.
