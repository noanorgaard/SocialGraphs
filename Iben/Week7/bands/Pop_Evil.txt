Shortly thereafter, TenFive broke up and Kakaty founded Pop Evil with Allison.<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/>\n\nKakaty and the members of Pop Evil endured years of playing the clubs without much to show for it. Kakaty said \"It was years of bologna sandwiches, playing so many cover shows until the early morning hours because we needed money to make good demos.\"<ref name=\"epple1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.journal-news.com/entertainment/arts--theater/pop-evil-singer-talks-about-band-trying-times/paTw3FLR8kWrFvZkfU3lgK/|title=Pop Evil's singer talks about band's trying times|last=Epple|first=Aaron|website=journal-news|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> The singer also endured his share of heartache when his girlfriend died in tragic circumstances in 2004.<ref name=\"epple1\"/>\n\nThey then independently released an album, ''War of the Roses'' (2004), and a three-song EP, ''Ready or Not'' (2006).
