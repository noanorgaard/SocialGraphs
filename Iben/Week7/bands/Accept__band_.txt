Their beginnings can be traced back to the late 1960s when the band got its earliest start under the name '''Band X'''. Their current lineup consists of Hoffmann, vocalist [[Mark Tornillo]], guitarist Philip Shouse, drummer Christopher Williams and bassist Martin Motnik. Accept has undergone numerous lineup changes, with Hoffmann being the only constant member. As of 2024, the band has released seventeen studio albums, five live albums and nine compilation albums.\n\nAccept played an important role in the development of [[speed metal|speed]]<ref name=\"Speed Metal\">[http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/biographie-groupe-Accept-id_bio-651-l-en.html \"Accept : Biography\"].

They first split up in 1989, several months after the release of ''[[Eat the Heat]]'' (which was their only album with Dirkschneider's initial replacement [[David Reece]]), but reformed in 1992 with Dirkschneider and released three more albums before disbanding again in 1997.

In 1972, Dirkschneider put together a new line-up of Band X and changed its name to Accept,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metalinside.de/band/accept | title=ACCEPT|website=Metalinside.de }}</ref> influenced by [[Accept (Chicken Shack album)|an album by that title]] by the British blues band [[Chicken Shack]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/accept/biography-cguu.html | title=Accept - Biografie|website=Chartsurfer.de }}</ref> For many years, Accept went through numerous line-up changes. This instability essentially kept the band on an amateur level, making sporadic appearances in festival concerts. Accept's professional career began in 1976, with Udo Dirkschneider, guitarist Gerhard Wahl, drummer Frank Friedrich, and new members Peter Baltes (bass) and Wolf Hoffmann (guitar), when they were invited to play at one of the first [[rock and roll]] festivals in Germany \u2014 Rock am Rhein. Following the festival, the band was offered a recording deal. Their first recording was the self-titled ''[[Accept (Accept album)|Accept]]'' album, which was released in 1979, but did not achieve much commercial success.\n\nThe first stable line-up of Accept was composed of vocalist Udo Dirkschneider, guitarists [[Wolf Hoffmann]] and [[J\u00f6rg Fischer]], bassist [[Peter Baltes]] and drummer Frank Friedrich. Friedrich quit the band after the release of ''Accept'' and was replaced by [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. This line-up recorded ''[[I'm a Rebel]]'' in 1980. The [[I'm a Rebel (song)|title track]] originally was written for [[AC/DC]] and recorded by the band but never released by them.<ref>[[Malcolm Dome|Dome, Malcolm]] and Ewing, Jerry. ''The AC/DC Encyclopaedia''. Chrome Dreams, 2008, pp. 101\u2013102.</ref> The album brought some media attention, and the band was invited to make a televised appearance.\n\nIn 1981, Accept's third studio album, ''[[Breaker (Accept album)|Breaker]]'', was released, and the band employed manager [[Gaby Hoffmann (manager)|Gaby Hauke]]. The same year, Accept served as a supporting act on [[Judas Priest]]'s [[World Wide Blitz Tour]], and obtained attention outside of Europe for the first time.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, ''[[Restless and Wild]]'' was released in 1982. J\u00f6rg Fischer left before the recording of the album began, as did his intended replacement, [[Jan Koemmet]].<ref>[http://www.metallian.com/accept.htm \"Accept Interview\"]. Metallian.

For example, the title track \"[[Balls to the Wall (song)|Balls to the Wall]]\" refers to slaves revolting against oppressing masters, while \"Fight It Back\" is about social misfits fighting against conformity. All songs were credited to Accept and \"Deaffy\". Deaffy was manager [[Gaby Hoffmann (manager)|Gaby Hauke]]'s pseudonym as the band's lyricist, although she did not officially claim ownership until the band had broken up for the second time.\n\nDuring a 1983 show in their hometown, the band met J\u00f6rg Fischer by chance and on Hauke's insistence, Fischer rejoined the band. A world tour followed through 1984, including the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival. By this time, the band was supported by [[Bad Steve]], a band which was led by former Accept and Band X members [[Dieter Rubach]], [[Jan Koemmet]] and Frank Friedrich. The band also opened for [[Iron Maiden]] on their [[World Slavery Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Iron Maiden Commentary \u2013 Tours \u2013 World Slavery Tour 1984-85 \u2013 Dates and Venues|url=http://www.ironmaidencommentary.com/?url=tour09_fotd/dates09_fotd&lang=eng&link=tours|work=Ironmaidencommentary.com|access-date=16 June 2021}}</ref>\n\n''[[Metal Heart]]'' was released in 1985.

Armitage also performed live with the band and one of the shows with him was reviewed by ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine. However, American vocalist [[David Reece]] was chosen and this new lineup recorded and released ''[[Eat the Heat]]'' in 1989. Accept toured in support of the album that year with bands like [[Metal Church]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and [[Armored Saint]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Church|url=http://metallipromo.com/mchurch.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Armored Saint|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/armored.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccept's career came to a sudden halt when Stefan Kaufmann sustained a serious injury to his back during the tour in support of the album. He was briefly replaced by [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] drummer [[Ken Mary]] for the remainder of the US tour. By the time the tour ended in late 1989, the band decided that without Kaufmann, and with differences surfacing with Reece, it was time to cease their activities for the time being.\n\n===Reunion with Dirkschneider (1992\u20131996)===\n[[File:Accept-04.jpg|thumb|left|Former lead singer Udo Dirkschneider (right) during Accept's reunion tour in 2005]]\nThe live album ''[[Staying a Life]]'', recorded in 1985, was released in 1990 as a souvenir celebrating their career.\n\nA few years later the ex-members met with Dirkschneider and decided to relaunch the band with core members Hoffmann, Kaufmann, Dirkschneider and Baltes.\n\nTheir comeback album, ''[[Objection Overruled (album)|Objection Overruled]]'', was released in 1993 and was a qualified success in Europe and the United States. [[Arjen Lucassen]] of [[Vengeance (band)|Vengeance]] was hired as touring guitarist but ended up leaving before the tour started.<ref name=\":0\" /> A world tour followed, and another album, entitled ''[[Death Row (album)|Death Row]]'', was released in the following year. Kaufmann became unable to play once again due to his recurring back injury and Stefan Schwarzmann became the temporary replacement.\n\n''[[Predator (album)|Predator]]'' (1996) was recorded in Nashville, with Udo's long-time (school) friend and producer [[Michael Wagener]] at the helm and with [[Michael Cartellone]] (from [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]]) filling in on drums. Accept's tour supporting ''Predator'' took place in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, with their last concert in Tokyo, Japan.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Second hiatus and brief reunion (1997\u20132005)===\nBetween 1997 and 2005, all the members continued working on their own projects. In 2005, Accept received an invitation from various European promoters for a short summer European Festival tour with Accept's classic line-up (Hoffmann, Baltes, Dirkschneider, Frank and Schwarzmann). These festivals turned out to be a stunning success, with the last show on 27 August 2005 in [[Kavarna]], Bulgaria, at the [[Kaliakra Rock Fest]].\n\nAsked in May 2007 by Lords of Metal if Accept was planning on writing and recording new music in the future, Dirkschneider replied:\n{{quote|That would be a problem. You know, it's easy to play the old songs, because they already exist. Especially for me, it was easier, because I still do those classics with U.D.O., but for some of the guys it was a bit harder.
