Kansas appeared on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts for over 200 weeks throughout the 1970s and 1980s and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan. \"Carry On Wayward Son\" was the second-most-played track on US classic rock radio in 1995 and No. 1 in 1997.<ref>{{cite press release |title=KANSAS Signs with APA |url= https://www.kansasband.com/kansas-signs-with-apa/ |date=April 2, 2015 |publisher= Kansas | website= Kansasband.com |access-date=December 14, 2020}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=December 2020}} Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] referred to Kansas as \"staples\" of [[classic rock]] radio.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |title=Kansas Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More {{!}} Al... |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kansas-mn0000303626#biography |access-date=2024-12-19 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1970\u20131973: early years===\nIn 1969, Don Montre and [[Kerry Livgren]] (guitars, keyboards, synthesizers) were performing in a band called the Reasons Why in their hometown of Topeka. After leaving to form the band Saratoga with [[Lynn Meredith]] and [[Dan Wright (musician)|Dan Wright]], they started playing Livgren's original material, with Scott Kessler playing bass and Zeke Lowe on drums.\n\nIn 1970 they changed the band's name to Kansas and merged with members of rival Topeka [[progressive rock]] group White Clover.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=696}}</ref> White Clover members [[Dave Hope]] (bass) and [[Phil Ehart]] (drums, percussion) joined with Livgren, vocalists Meredith and Greg Allen, keyboardists Montre and Wright and saxophonist Larry Baker.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\" />  This early Kansas group, sometimes called Kansas I, lasted until early 1971 when Ehart, Hope and some of the others left to re-form White Clover.{{citation needed|date= November 2019}}\n\nEhart was replaced by Zeke Lowe and later Brad Schulz, Hope was replaced by Rod Mikinski and Baker was replaced by John Bolton on saxophone and flute. This lineup is sometimes referred to as Kansas II, and 30 years later would re-form under the name [[Proto-Kaw]].\n\nIn 1972, after Ehart returned from England (where he had gone to look for other musicians), he and Hope once again re-formed White Clover with [[Robby Steinhardt]] (vocals, violin, viola, cello), [[Steve Walsh (musician)|Steve Walsh]] (vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, percussion) and [[Rich Williams]] (guitars). In early 1973 they recruited Livgren from the second Kansas group, which then folded.<ref>Rock Movers & Shakers by Dafydd Rees & Luke Crampton, 1991 Billboard Books.</ref> Eventually they received a [[recording contract]] with [[Don Kirshner]]'s eponymous label, after Kirshner's assistant, [[Wally Gold]], heard one of their demo tapes and came out to check out the band at one of their local gigs in March 1973 in [[Ellinwood, Kansas]]. After signing with Kirshner, the group decided to return to using the name \"Kansas\".\n\n===1974\u20131979: rise to national prominence===\n[[File:1976 - Ag Hall Concert Poster - Allentown Fair - Allentown PA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Promotional poster for Kansas' 1976 concert in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]]]\nTheir 1974 [[Kansas (Kansas album)|self-titled debut album]], produced by Gold, was released in March 1974, nearly a year after it was recorded in New York.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It defined the band's signature sound, a mix of American-style [[boogie rock]] and complex, symphonic arrangements with changing time signatures. Steinhardt's violin was a distinctive element of the group's sound, being defined more by [[heartland rock]] than the jazz and classical influences which most progressive rock violinists followed.\n\nThe band slowly developed a cult following due to promotion by Kirshner and extensive touring for the debut album and its two follow-ups, ''[[Song for America]]'' (February 1975) and ''[[Masque (Kansas album)|Masque]]'' (October 1975). ''Song for America'' was co-produced by Wally Gold and their former White Clover bandmate [[Jeff Glixman]], who would go on to produce all of their albums from ''Masque'' to ''[[Two for the Show (Kansas album)|Two for the Show]]'' (October 1978) on his own, returning to the helm for 1995's ''Freaks of Nature''. Both ''Masque'' and their next release, ''Leftoverture'', were recorded at a studio in the middle of the Louisiana [[Bayou]] named [[Studio in the Country]].\n\nKansas released its fourth album, ''[[Leftoverture]]'', in October 1976, which produced a hit single, \"[[Carry On Wayward Son]]\", in 1977. The follow-up, ''[[Point of Know Return]]'', recorded at [[Studio in the Country]] in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]] and [[Woodland Sound Studios]] in [[Nashville]] and released in October 1977, featured [[Point of Know Return (song)|the title track]] and \"[[Dust in the Wind]]\", both hit singles. ''Leftoverture'' was a breakthrough for the band, hitting No. 5 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop album chart. ''Point of Know Return'' peaked even higher, at No. 4. Both albums sold over four million copies in the U.S. Both \"Carry On Wayward Son\" and \"Dust in the Wind\" were certified [[music recording sales certification|gold singles]], selling over one million units each. \"Dust in the Wind\" was certified gold as a digital download by the [[RIAA]] in 2005, almost 30 years after selling one million copies as a single. ''Leftoverture'' was eventually certified five-times platinum by the RIAA in 2001.\n\nDuring this period, Kansas became a major headlining act and sold out the largest venues available to rock bands at the time, including [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]]. The band documented this era in 1978 with ''[[Two for the Show (Kansas album)|Two for the Show]]'', a [[double album|double]] [[live album]] of recordings from various performances from its 1977 and 1978 tours. The band gained a solid reputation for faithful live reproduction of their studio recordings.\n\nIn March 1978 Kansas was brought over to tour Europe for the very first time and later on that same year, they were named [[UNICEF]] Deputy [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador|Ambassadors of Goodwill]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nehrecords.com/shop/KansasPoint.html |title=Kansas - Point Of No Return |publisher=Nehrecords.com |date=June 27, 1978 |access-date=April 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309115828/http://www.nehrecords.com/shop/KansasPoint.html |archive-date=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe follow-up studio album to ''Point of Know Return'' was ''[[Monolith (Kansas album)|Monolith]]'' (May 1979), which was self-produced. The album generated a [[Top 40]] single in \"[[People of the South Wind]]\", whose title refers to the meaning of the 'Kanza' ([[Kaw people|Kaw]]) Native American people, after whom the state and the band are named. The album failed to garner the sales and radio airplay of its two predecessors. Nevertheless, the album eventually went platinum. Livgren's platinum award for the album is on display at the [[Kansas Museum of History]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/cool3/record.htm |title=Cool Things, Kansas Platinum Record, Kansas Historical Society |publisher=Kshs.org |access-date=April 18, 2011}}</ref> The band toured the US for ''Monolith'' during the summer and fall of 1979 then went over to tour Japan for the first time in January 1980.\n\n===1980\u20131984: creative tensions===\nKansas bandmembers began to drift apart in the early 1980s. During the tour supporting ''Monolith'', Livgren became an [[Born again (Christianity)|evangelical Christian]], and this was reflected in his lyrics on the next three albums, beginning with ''[[Audio-Visions]]'' (September 1980). \"[[Hold On (Kansas song)|Hold On]]\", a Top 40 single from that album, displayed his new-found faith. Hope soon converted to Christianity as well. This would be the final album with the original lineup (until they briefly reunited in 1999\u20132000), and also the last Kansas studio album to be certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nDue to creative differences over the lyrical direction of the next album, Walsh left in October 1981 to form a new band, [[Streets (band)|Streets]]. In early 1982 Walsh was replaced by vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist [[John Elefante]],<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\" /> who\u2014unknown to Livgren and Hope at the time\u2014was also a Christian.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Bruce|title=Elefante Interview|url=http://www.progrock.org/elefante/interview2.html|publisher=progrock.org|access-date=March 12, 2012}}</ref> He was chosen from over 200 applicants, such as [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Doug Pinnick]], [[Ted Neeley]] (who played the title character in the movie ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''), [[Warren Ham]] (ex-[[Bloodrock]], who would join the band on the road in 1982 adding sax, flute, harmonica,  back-up vocals and extra keyboards) and [[Michael Gleason (musician)|Michael Gleason]] (who would supply keyboards and back-up vocals on the group's 1983 tour).{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}\n\nThe first Kansas album with Elefante, ''[[Vinyl Confessions]]'', was released in May 1982. The record renewed interest in the group and generated the band's first Top 20 hit in several years, \"[[Play the Game Tonight]]\", which hit number 4 on Billboard's newly deployed Mainstream Rock chart. The album's mostly Christianity-based lyrics attracted a new audience and garnered radio airplay on the then fledgling [[Contemporary Christian Music]] format. The album featured backing vocals from [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], who was recording in the studio next door. Still, sales of the album fell short of gold status.\n\n''[[Drastic Measures]]'' followed in July 1983. For various reasons, Livgren contributed only three songs to the album; the rest were penned by John Elefante and his brother Dino. With violinist Steinhardt leaving the group before the recording sessions, the result was a more mainstream pop-rock album. Though the album charted lower than any Kansas album since ''Masque'', peaking at number 41, its single \"[[Fight Fire With Fire (Kansas song)|Fight Fire with Fire]]\" fared better. It did not crack the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], but reached No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was the highest chart position of any Kansas release on any chart, though this particular chart did not exist prior to 1981. For their 1983 tour for ''Drastic Measures'', Kansas was joined on stage by the aforementioned Michael Gleason and Terry Brock (who covered the absent Steinhardt's harmony vocals).\n\nDuring the band's time with Elefante as lead vocalist, Livgren became increasingly uncomfortable with Kansas representing his Christian worldview. After a final New Year's Eve performance on December 31, 1983, Livgren and Hope left to form [[AD (band)|AD]] with [[Warren Ham]] and [[Michael Gleason (musician)|Michael Gleason]]. They were joined by drummer Dennis Holt.\n\nElefante, Ehart and Williams sought to continue as Kansas and recorded one more song, \"Perfect Lover\", which appeared on the retrospective ''[[The Best of Kansas]]'' (August 1984), which has sold over four million units in the U.S. alone. The song would eventually be removed in favor of other songs on the remastered release of the compilation. The group disbanded after its release, which thus became the final Kansas recording with Elefante. Since leaving the band, Elefante has become a popular [[Contemporary Christian music]] artist and has not performed with the group since.\n\nIn March 1984, Ehart, Williams and Elefante were part of a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) tour of US military bases that had been put together by Ehart, called 1st Airborne Rock and Roll Division, that also included [[Patrick Simmons]] ([[Doobie Brothers]]), Leon Medica ([[LeRoux (band)|LeRoux]]), [[David Jenkins (musician)|David Jenkins]], [[Cory Lerios]] and John Pierce (from [[Pablo Cruise]]) and [[Robin Zander]], [[Rick Nielsen]] and [[Bun E. Carlos]] (from [[Cheap Trick]]). The supergroup began four days of rehearsals in [[Hawaii]] on March 10 before beginning a 17-day tour playing for the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] and land-based troops in [[Korea]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Diego Garcia]] and the [[Philippines]]. This was followed by a second USO tour in March 1985 that included Ehart, Williams and Steve Walsh.\n\n===1985\u20131990: reformation===\n[[File:SteveMorse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Kansas guitarist [[Steve Morse]]]]\nIn July 1985 the band came back together with Ehart, Williams and Walsh<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (who had briefly played keyboards on the road for Cheap Trick in the spring and summer of 1985 after the break up of [[Streets (band)|Streets]]), but without Livgren, Hope or Steinhardt.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\" /> The new lineup included Streets bassist [[Billy Greer]] and guitarist [[Steve Morse]] (formerly of the [[Dixie Dregs]]).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The first performances of the new lineup with Morse and Greer took place during a third USO 1st Airborne Rock and Roll Division tour that toured US military bases in the US, Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, [[Singapore]], [[Iceland]] and most of Europe during the late summer through early October 1986.\n\nThe re-formed band released ''[[Power (Kansas album)|Power]]'' on October 28, 1986.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The first single, \"[[All I Wanted (Kansas song)|All I Wanted]]\", became the last Kansas single to hit the ''Billboard'' Top 40 chart, reaching No. 19.  It made the Top 10 on Billboard's Album Rock Tracks and received considerable airplay on MTV. Two more singles, the title track and \"Can't Cry Anymore\", were less successful, \"Power\" hitting the lower end of the Hot 100 and getting substantial play and charting on the Rock Charts, but \"Can't Cry Anymore\" receiving little airplay despite a clever music video.  The album sold approximately 400,000 copies.\n\nThe band added Baton Rouge native Greg Robert on keyboards and back-up vocals at the suggestion of LeRoux's Leon Medica. Greg played his first show with Kansas on January 31, 1987, along with [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], at [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum]] in [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nThe new lineup released a second album, ''[[In the Spirit of Things]]'', in October 1988. The concept album and subsequent tour were popular with the fan base but did not receive widespread airplay beyond the \"Stand Beside Me\" video on MTV. Morse temporarily left the band at the end of a tour of Germany in April 1989.\n\nOn September 15, 1990, Walsh, Williams and Ehart played a charity event at the Saddlerock Ranch in [[Malibu, California]], alongside [[Saga (band)|Saga]], [[Lou Gramm]] (of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]), [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]], [[Eddie Money]], [[Kevin Cronin]] (from [[REO Speedwagon]]) and others. [[Alex Lifeson]] joined them on stage for a short set of Kansas before [[Geddy Lee]] flew in to join Alex for a [[Rush (band)|Rush]] set, with Ehart on drums subbing for [[Neil Peart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjof4u3R1Co| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211108/wjof4u3R1Co| archive-date=November 8, 2021 | url-status=live|title=Kansas - Live - 1990 - Carry On Wayward Son w/ Alex Lifeson(Malibu,California)|date=September 26, 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1990 a German promoter arranged to reunite all the original members of Kansas (except for Steinhardt) for a European tour. Greer joined them, along with keyboardist Greg Robert. At the end of the tour, Hope left again, but Livgren remained on into 1991.\n\n===1991\u20131997: addition of David Ragsdale===\n[[File:Kansas band 6-6-09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Kansas performing in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], 2009]]\n\nIn March 1991, violinist [[David Ragsdale]] (who had submitted a tape of his playing to Ehart several years earlier) was invited to join the group and the return of the violin allowed Kansas to perform earlier material in arrangements closer to the originals. Livgren left during the 1991 summer tour, to be replaced temporarily by Steve Morse again. After the tour, Morse left the band for good to return to his own projects and eventually become a member of [[Deep Purple]], and Ragsdale took over the extra guitar parts, leaving Williams as the primary guitar player. The resulting lineup of Ehart, Greer, Ragsdale, Robert, Walsh and Williams lasted from 1991 to 1997. This period saw one live album and accompanying video, ''[[Live at the Whisky]]'' (July 1992), and one studio album, ''[[Freaks of Nature (Kansas album)|Freaks of Nature]]'' (May 1995).\n\nDuring the fall of 1993, drummer Van Romaine (formerly of [[Blood Sweat and Tears]] and Steve Morse's band) came in to substitute for Ehart, who was taking care of the group's business and putting together ''[[The Kansas Boxed Set]]'', which was released in July 1994. Bryan Holmes, from [[The Producers (band)|The Producers]], likewise filled in for Ehart during the spring and summer of 1994 until that December, when Phil returned for a tour of Germany.\n\nOn July 28, 1995, Kansas was inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame in Hollywood.\n\n===1997\u20132006: return of Robby Steinhardt===\nIn early 1997, Robert and Ragsdale left the band and Steinhardt returned.\n\nIn May 1998, Kansas released ''[[Always Never the Same (Kansas album)|Always Never the Same]]'', which featured Larry Baird conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The album was a mix of older Kansas material (with new arrangements by Baird), several new songs and a [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\".\n\n''[[Somewhere to Elsewhere]]'', a new studio album released in July 2000, featured all the original members of Kansas, plus Greer, with all songs written by Kerry Livgren. That same summer, Kansas was the opening act for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] during their \"Masterworks\" tour.\n\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, Livgren would occasionally attend Kansas shows and come on stage to play one or more songs with the band. At a March 9, 2002 concert at [[Lake Tahoe]], he played the whole show, subbing for Rich Williams who was \"under the weather\", and another live album and [[DVD]] from Kansas, entitled ''[[Device - Voice - Drum]]'', which was recorded in the band's present home of [[Atlanta]] on June 15, 2002, was released that October.\n\nAlso in 2002, Kansas II (the lineup prior to the recording and release of the first Kansas album) released an album under the name [[Proto-Kaw]], featuring demos and live material recorded from 1971 to 1973. It led to a new studio album, ''[[Before Became After]]'' (2004), with most of the Kansas II members participating. Proto-Kaw released a third album, ''[[The Wait of Glory]]'', in 2006 and their fourth and final studio album, ''[[Proto-Kaw|Forth]]'', was released in 2011, after which the band ceased.\n\n===2006\u20132014: continued touring and regained popularity===\n[[File:Kansas Full 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Kansas performing in 2008]]\n[[File:David Ragsdale and Billy Greer 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|[[David Ragsdale]] (left) and [[Billy Greer]] onstage with Kansas in 2010]]\nKansas continued to tour every year.

Morse and Livgren appeared as special guests on several songs. The performance was released on CD, DVD, and Blu-ray as ''[[There's Know Place Like Home]]'' that October and the DVD hit No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Billboard'' Music Video Chart the week after its release.\n\nIn July 2010, Kansas completed a 30-day \"United We Rock\" tour with fellow classic rock acts [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]. Kansas then began a collegiate tour in September 2010. On this tour they performed with the symphony orchestras of various US colleges in an effort to raise money for the individual schools' music programs. The success of the tour led the band to start another one the following year.\nOn September 13, 2012, Kansas began a new tour with a performance at the [[PlayStation Theater|Best Buy Theater]] in New York City. Opening for them was the band [[King's X]] and a one-man-band called [[That 1 Guy]]. This tour featured many hits from the albums ''Leftoverture'' and ''Point of Know Return'', as well as material from a number of their other albums.\n\nThe band kicked off 2013 being featured on the Rock Legends II cruise. The floating rock festival for a cause aboard [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean International's]] [[MS Liberty of the Seas|Liberty of the Seas]] departed January 10, 2013, from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]. Other big names included [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Paul Rodgers]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]], [[Bachman & Turner]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], [[Foghat]] and [[Molly Hatchet]].\n\nOn March 1, 2013, Kansas announced a 40th anniversary celebration was in the works. However, Steinhardt suffered a heart attack days before the concert and was unable to participate. Nevertheless, the show went on, billed as the ''40th Anniversary Fan Appreciation Concert'', performed in Pittsburgh on August 17, 2013, at the same venue, [[Benedum Center]] (formerly The Stanley Theater), which had propelled them to national recognition. The show featured guest appearances by Kerry Livgren and Dave Hope and the first set featured symphonic accompaniment by the Three Rivers Orchestra, conducted by Larry Baird. Intermission featured Phil Ehart overseeing random prize drawings of autographed band merchandise, videotaped 40th anniversary well-wishes from other bands, and an exclusive first-look at the trailer for the upcoming feature-length documentary ''Miracles Out of Nowhere''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kansas-violinist-robby-steinhardt-suffers-heart-attack/ |title=KANSAS Violinist Robby Steinhardt Suffers Heart Attack |publisher=ultimateclassicrock.com |date=August 12, 2013 |access-date=June 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2014\u20132020: retirement of Steve Walsh, ''The Prelude Implicit''===\nOn July 2, 2014, a statement was issued on the band's official [[Facebook]] page announcing the impending retirement of lead singer [[Steve Walsh (musician)|Steve Walsh]].\n\nOn July 6, 2014, former Kansas lead singer [[John Elefante]] issued a statement that he had been contacted by the band on July 2 to discuss rejoining.
