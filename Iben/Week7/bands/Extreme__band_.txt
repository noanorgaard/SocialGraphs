Then they were also members of a band called The Dream, in 1980.  CBS Television bought the rights to the name, \"The Dream\" for a short lived television series called, \"Dreams.\"  So, they had to rename the band.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|editor-first= Colin |editor-last= Larkin |editor-link= Colin Larkin (writer) |date= 1997 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher= [[Virgin Books]] |edition= Concise |pages= 444\u2013445 |isbn= 1-85227-745-9}}</ref> Guitarist Nuno Bettencourt was in a band called Sinful, and bassist Pat Badger was playing with a Berklee College-based act called In The Pink. Bettencourt joined Cherone and Geary in a new group in 1985, followed by Badger in 1986. The four chose the name \"Extreme\" as it sounded like \"ex-Dream,\" a reference to Geary & Cherone's past band, \"The Dream.\"  Gary & Nuno crossed paths numerous times as Gary's brother Mark & Nuno's brother Paulo were in a well known local Boston band together called, \"Flesh.\"\n\nCherone and Bettencourt began writing songs together and the band performed continuously in the New England area. Extreme grew a large regional following and were named \"Outstanding Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Act\" at the [[Boston Music Awards]] in 1986 and 1987.\n\nThe band had accumulated several original songs by the time A&R director Bryan Huttenhower signed them to [[A&M Records]] in 1987 (which was soon sold to [[PolyGram]] in 1988). The band recorded their [[Extreme (Extreme album)|self-titled debut]] album which was issued in March 1989.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The first single was \"Kid Ego\", a song that Cherone would later admit made him cringe. The final track on the album, \"Play with Me\", was used as the \"mall chase\" song in the film ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===1990\u20131993: ''Pornograffitti'', ''III Sides to Every Story'', and mainstream success===\nSales of Extreme's first record were sufficient to support a second release. [[Michael Wagener]], who had previously worked with [[Dokken]] and [[White Lion]], was hired to produce the band's ''[[Pornograffitti|Extreme II: Pornograffitti]]'' album in 1990.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe record, which showcased Cherone's lyrics, and Bettencourt's guitar-playing, was a mixture of funk, pop and glam metal sounds. \"Decadence Dance\" and \"[[Get the Funk Out]]\" were released as singles. \"Get the Funk Out\" reached No. 19 in the UK charts in June 1991. Neither single was initially successful in the United States, however, and the album had fallen off the charts when A&M sent the third single to a number of US radio stations.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic]] [[ballad]] \"[[More Than Words]]\" entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on March 23, 1991, at No. 81. It later became a huge smash, hitting No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The subsequent single, \"[[Hole Hearted]]\", another acoustic track, was also successful, rising to No. 4 on the same pop chart.\n\nThe band began recording their third album in 1992. Their appearance at [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] in April 1992 interrupted the recording sessions, but it gave the band considerable exposure beyond the heavy metal fraternity.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> By playing a medley at the tribute, as well as \"Love of My Life\" and \"More Than Words\" acoustically, Extreme gained a considerable number of fans along with the Queen fan base. At the introductory speech before they played, [[Brian May]] noted that they were \"possibly more than any other group on this planet, the people that understand exactly what [[Queen (band)|Queen]] have been about all these years, and what Freddie was about all these years\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Eric |last= Garneau |title= A Look Back at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert |website= Cover Me |date= November 22, 2011 |access-date= April 30, 2022 |url= https://www.covermesongs.com/2011/11/a-look-back-at-the-freddie-mercury-tribute-concert.html}}</ref>\n\n''[[III Sides to Every Story]]'' was released on September 22, 1992.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The first single from the album, \"Rest in Peace\", had an accompanying video clip inspired by a film short by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] called ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Kate |last= Ruscito |title= NFB Remixed : Watch 5 Music Videos Inspired by the NFB |publisher= [[National Film Board of Canada]] |date= June 15, 2015 |access-date= April 30, 2022 |url= https://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2015/06/15/nfb-music/}}</ref>\n\n===1994\u20131996: Lineup change and ''Waiting for the Punchline''===\nPrior to the band's appearance at [[Monsters of Rock|Donington's Monsters of Rock]] festival in the summer of 1994, Geary left the band to pursue a career in artist management. Mike Mangini succeeded him on drums.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n''[[Waiting for the Punchline]]'', the first record to feature Mangini on three tracks (Paul Geary played on the rest of the album before departing), was released on February 7, 1995. The singles \"[[Hip Today]]\", \"Unconditionally\", and \"[[Cynical (song)|Cynical]]\" were released, but the album was not a commercial sales success. Extreme disbanded after the tour in 1996, on amicable terms, when Bettencourt decided to leave to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===1997\u20132003: Split and separate projects===\nOn the recommendation of former Extreme manager [[Ray Danniels]], in 1996, Gary Cherone joined one of the world's most successful rock acts, [[Van Halen]]. During 1996, Van Halen's fan-base weathered the acrimonious departures of two of rock's most successful lead singers: first [[David Lee Roth]], the band's original frontman (1974-1985), and then [[Sammy Hagar]], who had fronted Van Halen since 1985. Into this fractious, and very public, situation entered Cherone, whom guitarist [[Eddie Van Halen]] later called a \"musical soulmate\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Paul |last= Cantin |title= Report: Van Halen splits with singer |publisher= [[Jam!]].

All 12 of their previous albums had all sold over two million copies in the U.S. alone, with two selling over ten million in the U.S. alone\u2014and the previous five studio albums had all reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts. Van Halen's tour was successful; however, not as successful as in previous years.\n\nIn late 1999, after Van Halen's second album with Cherone was \"sent back\" by [[Warner Bros. Records]],{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Cherone left the band. He later formed [[Tribe of Judah (band)|Tribe of Judah]], which released an album called ''[[Exit Elvis]]'' in 2002. In 2005, Cherone released a four-song sampler CD, entitled ''Need I Say More''.\n\nIn 1997, Nuno Bettencourt released his first solo album titled ''[[Schizophonic (Nuno Bettencourt album)|Schizophonic]]''. In 1998 he formed a group called [[Mourning Widows]] who released a self-titled album that year and a follow-up album, ''[[Furnished Souls for Rent]]'', in 2000. Following the breakup of that band, he released another solo album under the project name of ''Population 1'' in 2002. Acquiring new members for the tour, he decided to keep the name Population 1 and the first release as a band was a five-song EP entitled ''Sessions from Room 4'' in 2004. They then changed the band's name to [[DramaGods]] and created a follow-up CD entitled ''[[Love (DramaGods album)|Love]]'' in 2005. Nuno, along with bandmates [[Kevin Figueiredo]] and Steve Ferlazzo, then went on to collaborate with [[Perry Farrell]]'s project [[Satellite Party]].\n\n''[[The Best of Extreme: An Accidental Collocation of Atoms?]]'', a 13-track Extreme \"best-of\" collection featuring tracks from the first three studio albums, was released in 1998. ''[[Extreme \u2013 The Collection]]'', a later collection including 15-tracks from the first four studio albums, was released in 2002.\n\n===2004\u20132010: Reformation and ''Saudades de Rock''===\n[[File:Extreme - Live Madrid 31 10 2008.jpg|thumb|Bassist [[Pat Badger]] and guitarist [[Nuno Bettencourt]] performing live in 2008. Bettencourt is one of the two constant members of Extreme.]]\nExtreme reformed for a short tour in 2004 playing in the [[Azores]] (August), in their hometown of Boston at the [[WKVB (FM)|WAAF]] anniversary (September 19) as well as a few concerts in Japan (January 2005). After a hiatus during 2005, the band returned in 2006 with the \"classic\" ''Pornograffitti'' lineup (including Paul Geary) to do a small, three-show reunion tour through [[New England]].\n\nIn July 2007, Bettencourt quit Satellite Party for another Extreme reunion with Cherone and Pat Badger. On November 26, 2007, the band announced plans for a world tour in the summer of 2008 with [[King's X]] as well as a release date for their new album, ''[[Saudades de Rock]]'', produced by Bettencourt. Kevin Figueiredo, who played with Bettencourt in [[DramaGods]] and Satellite Party, took over drum duties for the band. Original drummer Paul Geary would still remain involved with the band, albeit in a management position. Singles from the album have been available on MySpace including \"Star\". The album was released on July 28, 2008, in France, August 4, 2008, in Europe, and August 12, 2008, in the United States.\n\nThe band then embarked on the [[Take Us Alive World Tour]], supported by [[King's X]] in the US and [[Hot Leg]] in the UK, with various other dates in Europe and Asia, through all of 2008. In 2009, the band continued to tour, co-headlining the [[East Meets West Tour]] with [[Ratt]]. The final date of this tour, in their hometown of Boston, Massachusetts, was recorded for the release of the band's first live DVD called ''[[Take Us Alive]]''.\n\n===2010\u20132015: Hiatus, Hurtsmile, and other projects===\nAccording to a December 2010 interview with Cherone, Extreme had been writing new material for a new album, which they planned - at the time - to release in 2011. Asked in the same interview if the band will produce the new album by themselves or get an outside producer, Cherone replied, \"There's talk of a few people. It would be great to get an A-list name. I don't know if that happens. My dream producer would probably be [[Rick Rubin]].

Finally, in 2012, initially a small string of such shows in Japan had been confirmed, marking the full return of the band's activities after a hiatus when Bettencourt was on tour with Rihanna, as well as other side projects by other members, most notably Cherone's [[Hurtsmile]]. Extreme were to tour Australia in April 2013, with [[Richie Kotzen]] as support act, but the shows were cancelled due to scheduling conflicts with Rihanna's 2013 North American tour. They then did their first show in Singapore.\n\n===2015\u2013present: ''Six''===\n\nIn a May 2015 interview with Eddie Trunk, vocalist Gary Cherone said that Extreme had been writing and demoing new material for their follow-up to ''Saudades de Rock'', and would enter the studio in the fall to begin recording.<ref>{{cite web|title= Extreme to Record New Music in the Fall, Says Gary Cherone |website= [[Blabbermouth.net]] |date= May 16, 2015 |access-date= May 16, 2015 |url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/extreme-to-record-new-music-in-the-fall-says-gary-cherone/}}</ref>\n\nIn a September 2016 interview, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt revealed that Extreme had been working on approximately 17 songs for their new album, and added, \"We're about 17 songs into it.

After their Australian tour, they went on to tour Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok and Taipei.\n\nExtreme headlined Shirock 2019 alongside Scottish hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]. On October 19, 2019, the band performed in India in front of over 30,000 fans in [[Ukhrul]].\n\nOn February 17, 2023, the band began to release a different teaser each day, to end on February 28. On March 1, 2023, Extreme released the single \"Rise\" and announced that ''[[Six (Extreme album)|Six]]'' would be released on June 9 of the same year.
