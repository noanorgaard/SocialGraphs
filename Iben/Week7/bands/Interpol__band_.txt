Later, Kessler ran into Banks (whom he had first met in France) in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and the pair discussed collaborating. Banks admitted that he and Dengler \"butted heads\" early on in the band's history, but told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' that now the two are \"really tight, in a spiritual way\".<ref name=\"Night\">Raftery, Brian. \"Night Falls on Manhattan\".

The ''Antics'' tour stretched on for almost 18 months, including playing as [[undercard]]s for [[U2]] and [[the Cure]], and the band expressed feelings of exhaustion to [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Zane Lowe]] at a concert in [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The band took three months off after touring finished.

An update to their website in June confirmed that the band had been working on the follow-up since the turn of the year, but did not confirm a name for the album or comment on the mounting speculation that they were imminently to sign to a major label. On August 14, it was widely reported that Interpol had signed for [[Capitol Records]], a fact confirmed by Matador on September 1 in a press release on their website.\n\n''[[Our Love to Admire]]'' was released in July 2007. The album represents a departure for the band, being both the first record they have recorded in New York City (at [[Magic Shop (recording studio)|The Magic Shop]] and [[Electric Lady Studios]]), and the first time they have included keyboards in the arrangements from the start of the songwriting process. The band intended to tour behind the album extensively, beginning with the summer festival circuit throughout the United States and Europe.
