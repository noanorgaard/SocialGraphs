The group is known for creative [[segue]]s during live performances and pioneering the [[H.O.R.D.E.|H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival]].\n\nThe group comprises singer and harmonica player [[John Popper]], guitarist [[Chan Kinchla]], drummer [[Brendan Hill]], bassist [[Tad Kinchla]], and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999.\n\nTheir singles include \"[[But Anyway]]\", \"[[Run-Around (Blues Traveler song)|Run-Around]]\", and \"[[Hook (Blues Traveler song)|Hook]]\", the latter two from their 1994 album ''[[Four (Blues Traveler album)|four]]'' which sold over six million copies worldwide. Fans are permitted to record live events.\n\nSheehan's death and Popper's struggle with [[obesity]] put a damper on the group's mainstream success, and [[A&M Records|A&M]] dropped the band in 2002. In the years following, the band has attempted to work with a number of [[independent music|independent labels]] and record producers. \n\n''Traveler's Blues'', an album of [[blues]] covers, was released in July 2021, and was nominated by [[The Recording Academy]] for Best Traditional Blues album at the 2022 [[Grammy Awards]].\n\nTheir follow-up album, ''Traveler\u2019s Soul'', a collection of [[R'n'B]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] covers, was released in October of 2023.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nBlues Traveler originated as a [[High school (North America)|high school]] [[Garage rock|garage band]] in Princeton, New Jersey in the mid-1980s. Harmonicist, singer and guitarist John Popper and drummer Brendan Hill formed a group called The Establishment (later renamed Blues Band) with Hill's brother on bass and a rotating roster of guitarists. The band produced a few [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] [[demo (music)|demos]]. In addition to some original songs, their repertoire included upbeat [[cover version|covers]] of \"[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]\" and \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\".\n\nThe group added guitarist and [[American football|football]] player Chan Kinchla. Though a promising athlete, Kinchla decided to commit to music following a knee injury. Popper met bassist Bobby Sheehan and the two became friends, with Sheehan becoming the bass player for Blues Band in 1987.<ref name=\"DenverPost\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bluestraveler.net/info/media/media_display.php?pub_id=4|title=Coloradans come running when Traveler takes stage|last=Brown|first=G.|date=September 8, 1991|work=[[The Denver Post]]|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe quartet held a basement [[jam session]] (later christened The Black Cat Jam) which spawned the core [[groove (music)|grooves]] for several songs on their first album. A [[black cat]] happened to be nearby, and the group took this as a [[omen|sign]] and adopted the Black Cat as its [[mascot]].\n\nThe group changed their name to Blues Traveler, inspired by the [[demon]] featured in the film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', Gozer the Traveler.<ref name=\"DenverPost\"/>\n\n===Early years===\nAfter graduating from [[Princeton High School (New Jersey)|Princeton High School]] and moving to [[New York City]], Popper, Hill, and Sheehan enrolled in the music program at [[The New School]] while Kinchla attended [[New York University]].

The band has since made more appearances on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' than any musical artist. Letterman's band leader [[Paul Shaffer]] has played on a number of Blues Traveler recordings.\n\nIn 1992, the group founded the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] festival as an alternative to others such as [[Lollapalooza]], along with other bands such as [[Phish]] and Spin Doctors. Blues Traveler began recording their third album, ''[[Save His Soul]]''. Recording was temporarily interrupted by John Popper's [[motorcycle]] accident, although the band resumed touring shortly thereafter with Popper in a [[wheelchair]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Two singles were released from the album, \"Defense & Desire\" and \"Conquer Me\", which reached No.&nbsp;34 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.\n\n===Mainstream breakthrough===\nThe band's fourth album, titled ''[[Four (Blues Traveler album)|four]]'', was produced by the team of [[Michael Barbiero]] and [[Steve Thompson (musician)|Steve Thompson]] and released in late 1994. The upbeat pop single \"[[Run-Around (song)|Run-Around]]\" became the group's first chart hit followed by \"[[Hook (Blues Traveler song)|Hook]]\". \"Run-Around\" won a [[Grammy Award]] and broke a record for most weeks on the chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/513091/blues-travelers-john-popper/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009193815/http://www.mtv.com/news/513091/blues-travelers-john-popper/|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 9, 2017|title=Blues Traveler's John Popper|work=MTV News|access-date=October 9, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBlues Traveler appeared at [[Woodstock '94]] and later became an opening act for [[The Rolling Stones]]. The band played on the 1995 season premiere of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a last-minute replacement for [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. They were featured in an episode of the sitcom ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', and later recorded the show's [[Theme music|theme song]] for its final season. The 1996 comedy film ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'' featured the group playing their song \"[[But Anyway]]\" during the closing credits.\n\nThe group recorded the [[Johnny Rivers]] song \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\" for the film ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' at Icon Recording Studios in St. Louis, Missouri and the [[Bob Seger]] song \"Get Out of Denver\" for the film ''[[Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead]]'', as well as [[Fats Domino]]'s \"I'm Walkin{{'\"}} for ''[[Rebel Highway]]: [[Cool and the Crazy]]''. Several previously recorded Blues Traveler songs were included on film soundtracks, including ''[[The Last Seduction]]'', ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Very Bad Things]]'', ''[[White Man's Burden (film)|White Man's Burden]]'', and ''[[The Truth About Cats & Dogs]]''. The band also appeared in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' and on its soundtrack, playing \"Maybe I'm Wrong\", an original composition with a classic blues-rock sound. Blues Traveler recorded the [[Sly & the Family Stone]] song \"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\" for the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]] [[compilation album]] ''[[Hempilation]]'' and the [[John Lennon]] song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" for the Lennon [[tribute album]] ''[[Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon|Working Class Hero]]''. The original song \"Christmas\" was included on the benefit album ''[[A Very Special Christmas 3]]''.\n\nThe double live album ''[[Live from the Fall]]'' was released in 1996. It featured recordings from the band's autumn 1995 concerts and showcased the strength of the band's live performances.\n\nThe next studio album, ''[[Straight On till Morning (album)|Straight On till Morning]]'', also produced by Barbiero/Thompson, was released in 1997. It achieved [[RIAA certification|platinum status]], reaching number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, but did not perform as well as ''four''. The single \"Carolina Blues\" peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nBy the end of 1998, the band had prepared a [[concept album]] called ''The Sun, The Storm and The Traveler'', based on [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of ''[[The North Wind and the Sun]]'', and they planned to record it after a recess in the fall of 1999. That summer, John Popper had emergency [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] due to [[artery]] blockage, forcing the band to cancel their annual [[Independence Day (United States of America)|July 4]] [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre|Red Rocks]] shows at the last minute.\n\nDuring the hiatus, Popper released a solo album with a backing band consisting of drummer [[Carter Beauford]] and members of the group Cycomotogoat.\n\nThe band made an appearance performing as themselves in the 1998 movie ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' and the 1999 [[independent film]] ''[[Wildflowers (film)|Wildflowers]]'', which had been filmed a couple of years earlier.\n\n===Sheehan's death and new lineup===\nOn August 20, 1999, Bobby Sheehan was found dead in his [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], home, where he had been recording music with some friends the night before. Sheehan's death was ruled an accidental [[drug overdose]], with [[cocaine]], [[valium]], and [[heroin]] found in his system.\n\nThe remaining members of Blues Traveler convened and agreed that Sheehan would have wanted them to continue as a band. Auditions for a new bassist were held in concert, and included Chan Kinchla's younger brother Tad, who was unanimously determined to be the best choice for the role. Additionally, the band also auditioned for a permanent keyboardist\u2014an action Sheehan had often urged. In January 2000,<ref name=\"Net\">{{cite web |title=Keyboard player to join in studio |url=http://www.bluestraveler.net/info/news/news_display.php?news_date=20000129.txt |website=BluesTraveler.net |date=January 29, 2000 |access-date=March 12, 2007}}</ref> Ben Wilson of the [[jump blues]] band Big Dave & the Ultrasonics was chosen, and has since become a central contributor to the band's songwriting.\n\nThe band discarded their concept album material, instead releasing a smaller online EP, ''[[Decisions of the Sky: A Traveler's Tale of Sun and Storm]]'', and went to work collectively composing a new set of songs with the new lineup. The resulting album was ''[[Bridge (Blues Traveler album)|Bridge]]'', which had the working title ''Bridge Outta Brooklyn'' as a tribute to Sheehan (with both the acronym B.O.B. and his nickname \"Brooklyn Bobby\"). The songs \"Girl Inside My Head\" and \"Just for Me\" received airplay, but the album's sales fell somewhat short of expectations.\n\nThe live album ''What You and I Have Been Through'' and the compilation ''[[Travelogue: Blues Traveler Classics]]'' were both released in 2002.\n\n===Independent years===\n[[File:Blues Traveler 20081004.jpg|thumbnail|Blues Traveler in 2008]]\nBlues Traveler were one of dozens of artists who were jettisoned as part of [[A&M Records#Universal Music Group merging and Interscope Geffen A&M|A&M's corporate restructuring]]. The band signed with [[Sanctuary Records]] for their next album, ''[[Truth Be Told (Blues Traveler album)|Truth Be Told]]'', which achieved number 147 on The Top 200 chart.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The band's 2003 Independence Day concerts at Red Rocks Amphitheatre were released on the CD ''[[Live on the Rocks]]'' and the DVD ''Thinnest of Air'', and include [[Ziggy Marley]] singing on his father's song \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\".\n\nThe band left Sanctuary for [[Vanguard Records]] and released ''[[\u00a1Bastardos!]]'', which was produced by [[Wilco]]'s [[Jay Bennett]] and was touted as the band's return to music that they wanted to play. The album charted at 49 on the [[Independent Albums]], and [[\u00a1Bastardos en Vivo!|a live EP of songs from the album]] was released to independent record stores. The group recorded \"[[Rag Mama Rag]]\" for the 2007 tribute album ''[[Endless Highway: The Music of The Band]]'', as well as \"[[Free Bird]]\" for ''Under the Influence: A Jam Band Tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd''.\n\nBlues Traveler have been featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'', [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s ''[[Private Sessions]]'',<ref name=\"AEPS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=238854 |title=Watch Blues Traveler on TV |publisher=[[A&E Network]] |access-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526213510/http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=238854 |archive-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Austin City Limits]]''.
