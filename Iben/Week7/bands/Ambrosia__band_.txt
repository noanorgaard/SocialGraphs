Ambrosia had five Top 40 hit singles released between 1975 and 1980, including the Top 5 hits \"[[How Much I Feel]]\" and \"[[Biggest Part of Me]]\", and Top 20 hits \"[[You're the Only Woman (You & I)]]\" and \"[[Holdin' on to Yesterday]]\". Most of the original band members have been active with the group continuously since their 1989 reformation to the present day, with the notable exception of original guitarist and lead vocalist [[David Pack]] who left in 2000.\n\nAmbrosia currently tours internationally and has worked in the past and present with [[Alan Parsons]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bill Champlin]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], and [[Peter Beckett]] among other notable artists.<ref name=\"Billboard Chart\">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/ambrosia-p3537/charts-awards/billboard-singles |title=Billboard Chart |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nThe group was founded as a quartet with guitarist/vocalist [[David Pack]], bassist/vocalist [[Joe Puerta]], keyboardist [[Christopher North (Ambrosia)|Christopher North]] and drummer [[Burleigh Drummond]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|title=Ambrosia|first =Steve|last =Huey|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ambrosia-mn0000019133|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=2013-02-23}}</ref>  According to Joe Puerta,<ref name=\"JamesPetrecca\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejAkqtoT7Og#t=4m |title=AMBROSIA INTERVIEW JOE PUERTA 2016 JIM PETRECCA YESTERDAYS TREASURES PRODUCTIONS |publisher=James Petrecca |website=YouTube |date=July 9, 2016 |access-date=August 15, 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"DecadesTV\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgKX_qmndcQ#t=37s |title=Burleigh Drummond & Joe Puerta of Ambrosia talk How Much I Feel |publisher=Decades TV Network |website=YouTube |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=August 15, 2020 }}</ref> their original name was \"Ambergris Mite,\" but after doing some touring they discovered there was already a band using the name \"Ambergris,\" so they turned to the dictionary and picked the name \"Ambrosia\" because a name meaning \"nectar of the gods\" seemed fitting.<ref name=\"After5\">{{cite news |url=http://www.northstate.news/Archives/After5/20-02%20AF.pdf#page=2 |title=Holding on to Yesterday |magazine=After Five |publisher=North State News |date=February 2020|access-date=August 15, 2020 }}</ref> While Ambrosia had several radio hits in the 1970s, much of the material on their five albums is [[progressive rock|progressive]] in nature.\n\nThe founding constituents of Ambrosia were reared in [[Southern California]]'s [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]], later adopting [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] as their hometown. Their initial musical influences, like many of their generation, came from [[the Beach Boys]], [[Jimmy Reed]], [[King Crimson]], and [[the Beatles]]. Ambrosia fused [[Symphony|symphonic]] [[art rock]] with a slickly produced pop sound,<ref name=\"preston\">[http://www.inertron.com/ambrosia/ambrosiapage.html Preston, J. (n.d.). The Ambrosia page.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827021453/http://www.inertron.com/ambrosia/ambrosiapage.html |date=August 27, 2006 }} (retrieved September 7, 2006)</ref> resulting in a \"melodic prog\" style.\n\nEarly on, the band was infatuated with [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]] and began to experiment with vocal harmonies.<ref name=\"preston\"/>\n\nThe musicians, inspired by the music and artists of the [[progressive rock]] era, acquired a significant regional admiration. In 1971, a friend who was doing sound for the [[Hollywood Bowl]], invited them to play there on stage to test a new sound system that had been installed. The head engineer in charge at the Bowl was so impressed with the group that he invited them back to attend performances by the Los Angeles [[Philharmonic]]. He introduced them to conductor [[Zubin Mehta]], who featured Ambrosia as part of a so-called All-American Dream Concert.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=76}}</ref>\n\n==Rise to fame==\nAmbrosia auditioned for [[Herb Alpert]] and [[A&M Records]] early in their history, but were signed by [[20th Century Fox Records]] in 1975, who released two albums by the group.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nTheir first album, ''[[Ambrosia (album)|Ambrosia]]'', produced by Freddie Piro, was released in February 1975.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> It spawned the top 20 chart single \"Holdin' On to Yesterday\", as well as \"Nice, Nice, Very Nice\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> The latter sets to music the lyrics to a poem in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> The album was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Engineered Recording (other than Classical). [[Alan Parsons]] was the engineer for Ambrosia's first album and the producer for their second.<ref name=\"preston\"/> All four members of Ambrosia played on the first [[Alan Parsons Project]] album, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'', which was recorded soon after Ambrosia's first album. David Pack later appeared on the Alan Parsons album ''[[Try Anything Once]]'' (1993), co-writing, playing, and providing vocals on three songs.\n\n[[File:The music group Ambrosia backstage in the 1970s.jpg|thumb|325px|Ambrosia backstage in the 1970s. L to R: [[David Pack]], [[Joe Puerta]], [[Burleigh Drummond]], [[Christopher North (Ambrosia)|Christopher North]]]]\n\nAfter lengthy touring, the band recorded ''[[Somewhere I've Never Travelled]]'', produced by Alan Parsons and released in September 1976. The album yielded the title song and the single \"Can't Let a Woman\", which both became FM favorites, both featuring lush orchestration and vocal arrangements. The record sleeve folded into a large pyramid. ''Somewhere I've Never Travelled'' received a Grammy nomination and set the stage for the band's signing to [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1976 the group recorded [[the Beatles]] song \"[[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|Magical Mystery Tour]]\", for the transitory musical documentary, ''[[All This and World War II]]'' (November 1976).<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> The film's soundtrack consisted of different artists providing arrangements of Beatles songs. Their version of \"Magical Mystery Tour\" scored a top 40 hit,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> and has since been a staple of their live shows.<ref name=\"huey\">Steve Huey, Ambrosia Biography, from Yahoo! Music, [http://music.yahoo.com/library/default.asp?i=314313&m=bio&add=& music.yahoo.com].</ref>\n\nIn August 1978, ''Life Beyond L.A.'' was released. It marked a move away from their lush arrangements and introduced a more raw, aggressive jazz/R&B influence. Christopher North, who had family obligations and was not totally happy with the group's shift away from the sound of the first two albums, had left the group in 1977 during the album's recording.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nThe year 1978 marked their biggest pop breakthrough with their first Gold single \"[[How Much I Feel]]\" from the album, which was a No.&nbsp;3 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>  Warner Bros advertised the title cut for radio and ''Life Beyond L.A.'' started to get significant airplay on radio stations, a few months after the album's release. Extensive touring with [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], and the [[Doobie Brothers]], in addition to major headlining shows, cemented Ambrosia's reputation as a live act.<ref name=\"sonboleh\">[http://www.earthtone-music.com/amb.htm Sonboleh, R.

The first, \"[[Biggest Part of Me]]\", reached number three for three weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> and crossed over to the soul chart, where it peaked at number thirty-five.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=29}}</ref> The second, another blue-eyed soul hit, \"[[You're the Only Woman (You & I)]]\", reached No.&nbsp;13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. ''One Eighty'' earned the band three Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Group. A headlining world tour followed. For the Japanese leg of the tour, the group was joined by their longtime friend Cliff Woolley (formerly of [[The Association]], who had also guested on ''Life Beyond L.A.'') on guitar, harmonica, and backup vocals.\n\n[[File:Ambrosia1980.png|thumb|325px|Ambrosia in 1980. L to R: [[Christopher North (Ambrosia)|Christopher North]], [[David Pack]], [[Royce Jones]], [[David C. Lewis (musician)|David C. Lewis]], [[Burleigh Drummond]], [[Joe Puerta]]]]\n\nThe title of the album ''One Eighty'' was believed by fans to signal the group's \"180-degree\" change in direction.<ref name=\"sonboleh\" /> \n\nAlso in 1980, the band contributed the song \"Outside\" to the film ''[[Inside Moves]]'', and \"Feels So Good to Win\" appeared in the film ''[[Coast to Coast (1980 film)|Coast to Coast]]'' later that same year. The following year they placed another track, \"Poor Rich Boy\" (written by [[Burt Bacharach]]), on the soundtrack of the film, ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''.\n\nIn 1982, David C. Lewis briefly left the touring group to be replaced by [[Bruce Hornsby]], four years before his own rise to stardom. The same year, Ambrosia released their fifth and final studio album, ''Road Island'' (May 1982<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSQEAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard+ambrosia+Road+Island&pg=PT65|title=Billboard|date=May 15, 1982|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|access-date=August 9, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>), their first effort without the assistance of Freddie Piro's production company. Produced by [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]], the album consisted of intense, driving hard rock (outside of the soft ballad \"Feeling Alive Again\" and the progressive rock closer \"Endings\"). Though it received some airplay with \"How Can You Love Me\", the album was a commercial disappointment. The band broke up afterwards, ending their run of chart success.<ref name=\"sonboleh\" />\n\n==Later years==\nAfter Ambrosia, David Pack pursued a solo career and produced or worked with many top artists. Pack's 1985 solo album, ''[[Anywhere You Go]]'', included the song \"Prove Me Wrong\", which also appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]''. Joe Puerta became a founding member of [[Bruce Hornsby and the Range]].\n\nIn 1989, Ambrosia reunited with all four original members and began playing live shows again, mostly on the West Coast. They expanded their touring ranks once again with [[Tollak Ollestad]] (vocals, keyboards, harmonica) and Shem von Schroeck (vocals, percussion, bass, guitar).\n\nIn 1995, the band expanded their annual touring schedule. Pack had a conflict and guitarist John DeFaria filled in for him. [[Bernie Chiaravalle]] likewise stepped-in in the summer of 1997 and [[Mike Keneally]] did the honors in 1998 and 2000 for the concerts Pack was unable to play. Brian Stiemke subbed for an ill Burleigh Drummond for a few shows in 1997.\n\nIn May 1997, Warner Bros. released Ambrosia's greatest hits CD ''Anthology'', which contained tracks from all five albums plus three new tracks. In addition to ''Anthology'', the entire Ambrosia catalog was remastered and released on CD.\n\nThe band launched a 30th anniversary tour in 2000. Early the following year, it was announced that Pack had permanently left the band and he was replaced by [[Doug Jackson (musician)|Doug Jackson]], who had filled in for him for some shows the previous year. Pack's final show with the band was on November 4, 2000, in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. Jackson was in place on guitar for their 2001 shows, except for one gig at [[Stone Mountain Park]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on August 25 where Steve Farris (from [[Mr. Mister]]) subbed for him.\n\nRicky Cosentino filled in for Shem for some concerts in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2003. Shem then left in 2003 to join [[Kenny Loggins]]' band. [[Robert Berry]] (vocals, guitars), formerly of [[3 (1980s band)|3]] and [[GTR (band)|GTR]], joined temporarily in 2004\u20132005, and singer/guitarist [[Ken Stacey]] became a member in 2005. Shem then returned and he and Stacey alternated with the group for a while.\n\n[[Tollak Ollestad]] left in late 2004 to concentrate on a solo career and relocate to the [[Netherlands]] where he has had success. David C. Lewis then returned, after having substituted for Ollestad on some 1999 and 2003 gigs. Ollestad remained on call to sub for various band members and came back to play with Ambrosia's spring 2009 tour in place of Lewis and Shem.\n\nLater in 2009, Rick Cowling (formerly with Kenny Loggins) came in on vocals, guitar, and keyboards, though Ollestad still appeared with the band from time to time, most recently in 2010 when Doug Jackson was out playing guitar for [[Gary Wright]], and again while Cowling moved over to lead guitar until Jackson's return later in the year.\n\n==Current era==\n[[File:Ambrosia in concert on May 24, 2014.jpg|thumb|325px|Ambrosia in concert on May 24, 2014.

L to R: Joe Puerta, Ken Stacey, Mary Harris, Christopher North, Doug Jackson, Burleigh Drummond]]\nAmbrosia appeared on the May 2, 2011 episode of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' as part of the host's \"[[Yacht rock|Yacht Rock]] 2k11\" theme show, performing \"Biggest Part of Me\" (during the show) and \"How Much I Feel\" (after the formal taping, but put up on the Fallon website).\n\nIn 2012, Burleigh Drummond's wife [[Mary Harris (musician)|Mary Harris]], after filling in on a show or two since 2000, became a permanent band member on keyboards and vocals. Harris is also a vocal arranger and songwriter, who has co-written new material for Ambrosia performed onstage. She has previously worked in varied capacities with [[Pink Floyd]], [[XTC]], [[Stanley Clarke]] and for many years with [[Jimmy Buffett]].\n\nKen Stacey rejoined in 2014 after Rick Cowling departed. Ambrosia's six-person lineup was then  stable for a while and the group continued to tour, sometimes combining their talents with other artists including [[Bill Champlin]], [[Peter Beckett]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Dave Mason]], [[Gary Wright]], [[Al Stewart]] and others.\n\nAmbrosia's live performances showcase both their legacy hit material and more recent songs. Ambrosia continues to feature a majority of the band's founding members, with Puerta, Drummond and North onstage, as they have been for the past thirty plus years. [[Kipp Lennon]] (from the Venice, California band Venice) joined on lead vocals to start the 2021 tour as the band began their post lockdown era, Ken Stacey having exited during their downtime in 2020.\n\nFormer keyboardist for the band, [[David C. Lewis (musician)|David Cutler Lewis]], died of brain cancer on June 7, 2021.\n\nFormer member Shem von Schroeck returned in the fall of 2022, this time on drums, to sub for Drummond, who was recovering from back surgery. Shem likewise returned during the whole of 2024 (and will continue on into 2025) to stand in for Christopher North, who was undergoing a successful battle with [[throat cancer]]. After Shem's return, Kipp Lennon returned full-time to his other band Venice.\n\n===Live and alumni albums===\nOn September 1, 2001, the band recorded a live album at the Galaxy Theater in [[Santa Ana, California]] without David Pack. This album, ''Live'', was released in May 2002. Also, in 2003 [[Collectables Records]] released another compilation album, ''How Much I Feel and Other Hits''. \n\n[[David Pack]] released two 2005 solo projects: ''Unborn'', a compilation of older unreleased material, and the more up-to-date ''The Secret of Movin' On'' featuring collaborations with [[Timothy B. Schmit]] of [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] fame, former [[Journey (band)|Journey]] vocalist [[Steve Perry (musician)|Steve Perry]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]] vocalist [[Ann Wilson]] and [[America (band)|America]] co-founder [[Dewey Bunnell]], amongst others. Both albums follow in Pack's later era style of smooth pop-rock.\n\n===Member solo projects===\nSeveral members have established careers outside of Ambrosia. \n* Joe Puerta has started a studio near his suburban Milwaukee home, The Exchange, where he's produced several artists including Les Lokey, Big Nick & the Cydecos, Alaria Taylor and The Good Luck Joes.\n* Burleigh Drummond drummed for roots CCM supergroup [[Lost Dogs]] for several albums. He and wife Mary Harris co-founded their own group, Tin Drum, which has released three albums with various backing musicians, and in 2024 the ''Tin Drum Family Band''<ref>{{cite web | title=Tin Drum Family Band | url=https://www.tindrummusic.com/thetindrumfamilyband }}</ref> which includes their daughter Sierra Drummond and son Burleigh Drummond IV. Tin Drum is also a production company with such varied artists on their roster as bluesman Mighty Mo Rodgers and kids-oriented gospel act Kingdom Bound.\n* Doug Jackson released his second solo album in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/dougjackson22|title=\u266b The Performance - Doug Jackson.
