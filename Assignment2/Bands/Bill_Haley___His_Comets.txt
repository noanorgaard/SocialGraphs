'''William John Clifton Haley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|i}}; July 6, 1925 – February 9, 1981) was an American [[rock and roll]] musician. He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] and million-selling hits such as "[[Rock Around the Clock]]", "[[See You Later, Alligator]]", "[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]", "[[Rocket 88]]", "[[Skinny Minnie]]", and "Razzle Dazzle". Haley has sold over 60 million records worldwide. In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==Early life and career==
Haley was born July 6, 1925, in [[Highland Park, Michigan]].<ref name=Fuchs /> In 1929, the four-year-old Haley underwent an inner-ear mastoid operation which accidentally severed an optic nerve, leaving him blind in his left eye for the rest of his life. It is said that he adopted his trademark [[kiss curl]] over his right eye to draw attention from his left, but it also became his "gimmick", and added to his popularity.<ref name=Fuchs>{{cite book|last1=Fuchs|first1=Otto|title=Bill Haley: The Father of Rock & Roll|date=2014|publisher=Wagner|isbn=9783866839014|page=16}}</ref> As a result of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the [[Detroit]] area, his father moved the family to [[Bethel Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Bethel Township, Pennsylvania]], when Bill was seven years old.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goodley|first1=George Walter|title=Bethel Township Delaware County, Pennsylvania Thru Three Centuries|date=1987|page=97}}</ref>  Haley's father William Albert Haley (1900–1956) was from [[Kentucky]] and played the [[banjo]] and [[mandolin]], and his mother, Maude Green (1895–1955), who was originally from [[Ulverston]] in [[Lancashire]], England, was a technically accomplished [[keyboardist]] with classical training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/haley.html|title=Bill Haley and his Comets|publisher=Classic Bands}}</ref> Haley told the story that when he made a simulated guitar out of cardboard, his parents bought him a real one.{{sfn|Swenson|1982|pp=15,17}}

One of his first appearances was in 1938 for a Bethel Junior baseball team entertainment event, performing guitar and songs when he was 13 years old.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarrick|first1=Elizabeth|title=Bethel Township, Delaware County|date=2013|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-9818-5|page=105}}</ref>

According to the anonymous sleeve notes accompanying the 1956 Decca album ''Rock Around the Clock'', Haley left home at fifteen with his guitar and spent the next few years poverty-stricken until he joined a group called the Down Homers while they were in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=13813 |title=Bill Haley and the Saddlemen |publisher=Hillbilly-Music.com |date=February 9, 1981 |access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref> In 1947, Haley formed his own group, Four Aces of Western Swing, later renamed to the Saddlemen. The group subsequently signed with [[Dave Miller (producer)|Dave Miller's]] [[Holiday Records]] and, on June 14, 1951, the Saddlemen recorded a cover of the [[Jackie Brenston|Delta Cats]] "[[Rocket 88]]".<ref name="Kallen">{{cite book |last=Kallen |first=Stuart |date=9 May 2012 |title=The History of American Pop |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zohmDwAAQBAJ&q=Crazy+Man%2C+Crazy+bill+haley+million&pg=PA33 |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |page=33 |isbn=978-1420506723}}</ref>

==Bill Haley and His Comets==

{{main|Bill Haley & His Comets}}
During the Labor Day weekend in 1952, the Saddlemen were renamed '''Bill Haley with Haley's Comets'''. The name was inspired by the supposedly official pronunciation of [[Halley's Comet]] and was suggested by Bob Johnson, program director at radio station WPWA where Bill Haley had a live radio program from 12:00{{spaces}}noon to 1:00{{spaces}}p.m.<ref name="Kallen" /> In 1953, Haley's recording of "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]" (co-written by Haley and his bass player, [[Marshall Lytle]], although Lytle would not receive credit until 2001) hit the American charts, peaking at number 12 on ''Billboard'' and number 11 on ''Cash Box''. Some sources indicate that this was the first [[rock and roll]] record in history, although [[rockabilly]] might be a more appropriate term.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kallen |first=Stuart |date=9 May 2012 |title=The History of American Pop |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zohmDwAAQBAJ&q=Crazy+Man%2C+Crazy+bill+haley+million&pg=PA33 |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |page=34 |isbn=978-1420506723 |accessdate=November 10, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/249571-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* – Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=Style: Rock & Roll, Rockabilly}}</ref> By the time this record was released, the group's name had been revised to using the term "Comets" instead of "Saddlemen".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2135591-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* – Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref>

[[File:Bill Haley, 1974, Liége 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Haley and the Comets performing in 1974]]

In 1954, Haley recorded "[[Rock Around the Clock]]".{{sfn|Dawson|2005}} Initially, it was only a moderate success, peaking at number  36 on the ''Cash Box'' pop singles chart and staying on the charts for just two weeks.  On re-release, the record reached number one on July 9, 1955.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550820.html|title=Cash Box Top Singles 8/20/55|website=Cashboxmagazine.com|access-date=July 5, 2025|archive-date=August 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815054503/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550820.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Haley had already had a worldwide hit with "[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]", another [[rhythm and blues]] cover in this case from [[Big Joe Turner]],  which went on to sell a million copies and was the first rock 'n' roll song to enter the [[UK Singles Chart]] in December 1954, becoming a gold record.<ref name="ukcharts">{{cite web|title=Bill Haley & His Comets|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/1636/bill-haley-and-his-comets/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=July 5, 2025}}</ref> He retained elements of the original (which was slow blues), but sped it up with some country music aspects into the song (specifically, Western swing) and changed up the lyrics. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as "Rock and Roll" to a wider audience after a period of it being considered an underground genre.{{sfn|Dawson|2005|pp=95–96}}

When "Rock Around the Clock" appeared as the theme song of the 1955 film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' starring [[Glenn Ford]], it soared to the top of the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart for eight weeks.<ref name="haleyhall">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/bill-haley|title=Bill Haley|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}</ref> The single is commonly used as a convenient line of demarcation between the "rock era" and the music industry that preceded it. ''Billboard'' separated its statistical tabulations into 1890–1954 and 1955–present. After the record rose to number one, Haley became widely popular with those who had come to embrace the new style of music. With the song's success, the age of rock music began overnight and ended the dominance of the jazz and pop standards performed by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Jo Stafford]], [[Perry Como]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Eddie Fisher]], and [[Patti Page]].<ref name="weinstein">{{cite book |last=Weinstein |first=Deena |date=2015-01-27 |title=Rock'n America: A Social and Cultural History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8WnBgAAQBAJ&q=the+first+rock+n+roll+record&pg=PA57 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=57 |isbn=978-1442600157}}</ref> "Rock Around the Clock" was also the first record to sell over one million copies in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[West Germany|Germany]].<ref name="ukcharts" /> [[Danny Cedrone]], not a member of The Comets, played the guitar solo on the record, though did not live long enough to see the song's success as he died shortly after the recording following a fall down stairs at his home, aged 33.<ref>{{cite web |title=Danny Cedrone |url=https://rockandrollparadise.com/danny-cedrone-61954/ |website=Rock and Roll Paradise |access-date=5 July 2025}}</ref>

Bill Haley and the Comets performed "Rock Around the Clock" on the ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on May 31, 1955, on [[NBC]] in an'' a cappella'' and lip-synched version. Berle predicted that the song would go number one: "A group of entertainers who are going right to the top." Berle also sang and danced to the song which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre with a much wider audience.{{sfn|Dawson|2005|pp=95–96}}

Bill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll act to appear on American musical variety series the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on August 7, 1955, on [[CBS]] in a broadcast that originated from the [[American Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Festival Theater]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. They performed a live version of "Rock Around the Clock" with Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The band made their second appearance on the show on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing the songs "[[Rudy's Rock]]" and "Forty Cups of Coffee".<ref name="weinstein" />

Later on in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour Europe. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as "[[See You Later, Alligator]]" and he starred in the first rock and roll musical films ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'', both in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taysom |first1=Joe |title=The movie that changed The Who’s Pete Townshend’s life forever: “Mesmerised” |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/movie-changed-the-who-pete-townshend-life/ |website=Far Out Magazine |access-date=5 July 2025}}</ref> Haley was already 30 years old, and his popularity was soon eclipsed in the United States by the younger [[Elvis Presley]], but continued to enjoy great popularity in Latin America, Europe, and Australia during the 1960s.<ref name="weinstein" />

Bill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] twice in 1957, on the prime time show October 28, 1957, and on the regular daytime show on November 27, 1957. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'', also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'', a primetime TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season and on February 20, 1960, performing "Rock Around the Clock"; "Shake, Rattle and Roll"; and "Tamiami".{{sfn|Swenson|1982|p=164}}

==Later career and death==
Haley failed to achieve the level of success enjoyed by contemporaries such as [[Little Richard]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. According to one source, "he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFzMvgEACAAJ|title=Crazy Man, Crazy The Bill Haley Story|author1=Bill Haley Jr.|author2=Peter Benjaminson |year=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781617137112}}</ref> Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]],<ref name=FallingComet>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/falling-comet/|title=Falling Comet|date=2011-06-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=bill+haley+%22alcoholism%22&pg=PP15|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|language=en}}</ref> Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, benefiting from a 1950s nostalgia movement that began in the late 1960s and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European [[Sonet Records|Sonet]] label. He performed for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] on November 26, 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1979-london-theatre-royal|title=Performances :: 1979, London Theatre Royal &#124; Royal Variety Charity|website=Royalvarietycharity.org|access-date=May 12, 2023}}</ref>

The October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley's British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that "Haley had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone anymore." In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.{{sfn|Swenson|1982|p=154}}

Haley's widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, "It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card."<ref name=FallingComet/>

At the same time, Haley's alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. "There were days we never saw him", said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." After being picked up by the police in [[Harlingen, Texas]] several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, "This is pointless." She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.<ref name=FallingComet/>

Media reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982,{{sfn|Swenson|1982|pp=155–159}} Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives toward the end of his life in which he was semi-coherent. His first wife has been quoted as saying, "He would call you and ramble, dwelling on the past..." The biography also describes Haley painting the windows of his home black,{{sfn|Swenson|1982|p=154}} but there is little other information available about his final days.

Haley died at his home in Harlingen on February{{spaces}}9, 1981, aged 55.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/10/obituaries/bill-haley-55-dies-singer-band-leader.html "Obituary for Bill Haley"], ''New York Times'', February 10, 1981.</ref> He was discovered lying motionless on his bed by a friend who had stopped by to visit him. The friend immediately called the police and Haley was pronounced dead at the scene.<ref name=FallingComet/> Haley's death certificate gave "natural causes, most likely a [[heart attack]]" as being the cause.{{sfn|Swenson|1982|p=164}} Following a small funeral service attended by 75 people,<ref name=FallingComet/> Haley was cremated in [[Brownsville, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_l_1NkpGBrEC&dq=bill+haley+harlingen+grave&pg=PA869|title=Bill Haley|publisher=Wagner Verlag sucht Autoren |isbn=9783862795376}}</ref>
