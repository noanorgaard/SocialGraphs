    "TF-IDF is a way to score/measure how important a word is for a text in relation to how frequent the word is used overall in all texts. For instance, if a word appears a lot in a text, it has a high TF, but it can still have a low IDF if it appears frequently in a lot of texts like for instance, we can imagine words like \"the\", \"and\", \"good\", \"to\" etc. word have high TF but low IDF.\n",

    "This score/measure can help us understand the genres, because we can look through the texts of all bands in each genre. This will then highlight genre-specific terms/words. This could make it easier to cluster similar artists, as artist with similar high-scoring TF-IDF words can be grouped into comunities or genre clusters. TF-IDF can also help distinguish what makes each genre unique, by boosting words/terms that are frequent in one genre (high TF) and then downweighing words that are commen across all genres (low IDF).
